Robert Cohn was once middleweight boxing champion of Princeton.

Do not think that I am very much impressed by that as a boxing title, but it meant a lot to Cohn.

He cared nothing for boxing, in fact he disliked it, but he learned it painfully and thoroughly to counteract the feeling of inferiority and shyness he had felt on being treated as a Jew at Princeton.

There was a certain inner comfort in knowing he could knock down anybody who was snooty to him, although, being very shy and a thoroughly nice boy, he never fought except in the gym.

He was Spider Kelly's star pupil.

> Spider Kelly的原名是Tommy "Spider" Kelly (1867.9.6 – 1927.1.4），来自纽约的黑人区（Harlem, New York）, 因此大家也会把他称作“The Harlem Spider”. 在1890到1892之间，他都是最轻量级拳击手中的世界冠军（the world champion bantamweight fighter）.

Spider Kelly taught all his young gentlemen to box like featherweights, no matter whether they weighed one hundred and five or two hundred and five pounds.

> 拳击比赛分为8个体重级别，Spider Kelly属于的是Bantamweight（“最轻量级”），bantam这个词原本指“矮脚鸡”，体重在112到118磅之间（约51到54公斤）的拳击手属于这个级别；而Featherweight则是“羽量级”，这一级别的拳击手体重在118到126磅（约54到57公斤）之间。Cohnn本身是属于Middleweight “中量级”的（Robert Cohn was once middleweight boxing champion of Princeton），体重约在73公斤以下。

But it seemed to fit Cohn. He was really very fast.

He was so good that Spider promptly overmatched him and got his nose permanently flattened.

> ==permanently英 ['pɜ:mənəntlɪ] 美 [ˈpəmənəntlɪ] adv. 永久地，长期不变地==
>
> <font color=red>He was so good that Spider promptly overmatched him and got his nose permanently flattened.</font>

> 他学得很好，斯拜德马上安排他跟强手交锋，给他终生留下了一个扁平的鼻子。
>
> **💧表达精讲**

> ①overmatch的本义是指“比……强”，比如be a match for表示“旗鼓相当”，而overmatch就是to be more than a match for.
>
> *但是这里的overmatch并不是指Spider比Cohn厉害然后把他的鼻子打扁了；在体育术语里，overmatch指“为……安排强手”（to match with a superior opponent）. 所以这里是Spider看到Cohn学得很优秀，所以马上让他跟高手过招。
>
> ②flatten从“使变平”这个意思还可以引申为“夷为平地，炸平”，相当于level. 比如：Hundreds of homes were flattened/levelled by the tornado. 数百户住宅被龙卷风夷为平地。

This increased Cohn's distaste for boxing, but it gave him a certain satisfaction of some strange sort, and it certainly improved his nose.

> <font color=red>This increased Cohn's distaste for boxing, but it gave him a certain satisfaction of some strange sort, and it certainly improved his nose.</font>

>
> **💧知识拓展**
>
> 为什么把鼻子打扁了些反而还好看了呢？这其实源于对犹太人面部特征的刻板印象。在13世纪中叶的欧洲，犹太人的鹰钩鼻（hooked noses）往往在画作里被过度渲染成充满敌意的样子（singled out as a hostile caricature），以致于后来一提到犹太人，大家就觉得他们都是鼻梁突起高耸、然后鼻头向下弯。Cohn在大学的时候遭受嘲笑也多半是因为这个，现在鼻子扁了一点，他反而感到庆幸。

In his last year at Princeton he read too much and took to wearing spectacles. I never met any one of his class who remembered him.

They did not even remember that he was middleweight boxing champion.

I mistrust all frank and simple people, especially when their stories hold together, and I always had a suspicion that perhaps Robert Cohn had never been middleweight boxing champion,

> <font color=red>I mistrust all frank and simple people, especially when their stories hold together...</font>

and that perhaps a horse had stepped on his face, or that maybe his mother had been frightened or seen something, or that he had, maybe, bumped into something as a young child,

but I finally had somebody verify the story from Spider Kelly.

> ==verify英 [ˈverɪfaɪ] 美 [ˈvɛrəˌfaɪ] vt. 核实；证明；判定==

Spider Kelly not only remembered Cohn. He had often wondered what had become of him.

Robert Cohn was a member, through his father, of one of the richest Jewish families in New York,and through his mother of one of the oldest.

At the military school where he prepped for Princeton, and played a very good end on the football team, no one had made him race-conscious.

> ==prep vt. 使(某人)做好进行手术〔考试〕的准备==
>
> ==race-conscious 种族意识的==

No one had ever made him feel he was a Jew, and hence any different from anybody else, until he went to Princeton.

He was a nice boy, a friendly boy, and very shy, and it made him bitter.

He took it out in boxing, and he came out of Princeton with painful self-consciousness and the flattened nose, and was married by the first girl who was nice to him.

He was married five years, had three children, lost most of the fifty thousand dollars his father left him, the balance of the estate having gone to his mother, hardened into a rather unattractive mould under domestic unhappiness with a rich wife;

> <font color=red>He was married five years, / had three children, / lost most of the fifty thousand dollars his father left him, / the balance of the estate having gone to his mother, / hardened into a rather unattractive mould under domestic unhappiness with a rich wife...</font>

> 他结婚五年，生了三个孩子，父亲留给他的五万美元几乎挥霍殆尽（遗产的其余部分归他母亲所有），由于和有钱的妻子过着不幸的家庭生活，他变得冷漠无情、使人讨厌……
>
> **💧句式拆解**
>
> ①首先来看这个句子主体部分的谓语有哪些：He was married..., had..., lost..., hardened into...（注意这里没有按照通常的语法规则用and作连接）；
>
> ②the balance of the estate having gone to his mother 属于独立主格结构（在盖茨比当中出现过不只一次哦~）整个句子本身的主语是he（Cohn），这里出现了the balance of the estate作主语，后面则是having gone的现在分词短语作伴随状语；因为主语不同，所以整个结构都是可以独立在句子之外来看的；
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①the balance of the estate “遗产的其余部分”；estate常见指“庄园，住宅”，但在这里是“个人全部财产（尤指遗产）”；balance表示“剩余（部分）”，也就是the rest. 比如：The firm owns about 96% of the portfolio, with the balance belonging to our family. （资产组合中，公司拥有96%左右的股份，剩余部分为我们家族所有。）
>
> *再补充一个知识点，balance从“剩余”这个含义还延伸出了很多日常惯用表达，比如表示“银行账户余额”：My bank balance isn’t good.（我的银行账户里余额不多了。）
>
> 还可以用来指“假期余额”: The balance of my annual leave still has 5 days.（我剩下的年假还有5天。）
>
> ②harden into 指“变得冷酷无情”（to become less sympathetic and gentle）, 比如：Her years of drunken bickering hardened my heart.（她常年醉酒吵闹让我的心麻木了。）
>
> ③a rather unattractive mould “讨人厌的类型”；mould本义是“模具”，在这里指“人的气质类型”（type of person）. 比如：a hero in the ‘Superman’ mould（“超人”型的英雄）

and just when he had made up his mind to leave his wife she left him and went off with a miniature-painter.

> ==miniature英 [ˈmɪnətʃə(r)] 美 [ˈmɪniəˌtʃʊr, -tʃɚ, ˈmɪnə-] adj. 小型的，微小的 n. 微型复制品；微小模型；微型画；微型人像画==

As he had been thinking for months about leaving his wife and had not done it because it would be too cruel to deprive her of himself, her departure was a very healthful shock.

The divorce was arranged and Robert Cohn went out to the Coast.

In California he fell among literary people and, as he still had a little of the fifty thousand left, in a short time he was backing a review of the Arts.

The review commenced publication in Carmel, California, and finished in Province town, Massachusetts.

By that time Cohn, who had been regarded purely as an angel, and whose name had appeared on the editorial page merely as a member of the advisory board, had become the sole editor.

It was his money and he discovered he liked the authority of editing. He was sorry when the magazine became too expensive and he had to give it up.

By that time, though, he had other things to worry about. He had been taken in hand by a lady who hoped to rise with the magazine.

> <font color=red>He had been taken in hand by a lady who hoped to rise with the magazine.</font>
>
> 他已经被一位指望跟这家杂志一起飞黄腾达的女士捏在手心里了。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> had been taken in hand “被捏在手心里”，take sb in hand也就是“掌控、支配某人”，hand在这里相当于control. 比如a manager with a firm hand表示“一位手段强硬（管理严格）的经理”。

She was very forceful, and Cohn never had a chance of not being taken in hand. Also he was sure that he loved her.

When this lady saw that the magazine was not going to rise, she became a little disgusted with Cohn and decided that she might as well get what there was to get while there was still something available, so she urged that they go to Europe, where Cohn could write.

They came to Europe, where the lady had been educated, and stayed three years. During these three years, the first spent in travel, the last two in Paris, Robert Cohn had two friends, Braddocks and myself. Braddocks was his literary friend. I was his tennis friend.

The lady who had him, her name was Frances, found toward the end of the second year that her looks were going, and her attitude toward Robert changed from one of careless possession and exploitation to the absolute determination that he should marry her.

> ==exploitation英 [ˌeksplɔɪˈteɪʃn] 美 [ˌɛksplɔɪˈteʃən] n. 开发；剥削；利用==
>
> n. 开发；剥削；利用
>
> ...and her attitude toward Robert changed from one of careless possession and exploitation to the absolute determination that he should marry her.
>
> 一反过去漫不经心地掌握并利用科恩的常态，断然决定他必须娶她。
>
> 💧exploitation可以指贬义上的“剥削，利用”，也可以指中性意义上的“开发，开采”，比如：the controlled exploitation of resources（有节制的资源开发）

During this time Robert's mother had settled an allowance on him, about three hundred dollars a month. During two years and a half I do not believe that Robert Cohn looked at another woman.

He was fairly happy, except that, like many people living in Europe, he would rather have been in America, and he had discovered writing.

He wrote a novel, and it was not really such a bad novel as the critics later called it, although it was a very poor novel. He read many books, played bridge, played tennis, and boxed at a local gymnasium.

> ==gymnasium英 [dʒɪmˈneɪziəm] 美 [dʒɪmˈneziəm] n. 健身房，体育馆==

I first became aware of his lady's attitude toward him one night after the three of us had dined together. We had dined at l'Avenue's and afterward went to the café? de Versailles for coffee.

We had several fines ([法]白兰地) after the coffee, and I said I must be going. Cohn had been talking about the two of us going off somewhere on a weekend trip.

He wanted to get out of town and get in a good walk.

I suggested we fly to Strasbourg and walk up to Saint Odile, or somewhere or other in Alsace.

"I know a girl in Strasbourg who can show us the town," I said.

Somebody kicked me under the table.

I thought it was accidental and went on: "She's been there two years and knows everything there is to know about the town. She's a swell girl."

> ==swell adj. 漂亮的；一流的==

I was kicked again under the table and, looking, saw Frances, Robert's lady, her chin lifting and her face hardening.

"Hell," I said, "why go to Strasbourg? We could go up to Bruges, or to the Ardennes."

Cohn looked relieved. I was not kicked again. I said good-night and went out.

Cohn said he wanted to buy a paper and would walk to the corner with me.

"For God's sake," he said, "why did you say that about that girl in Strasbourg for? Didn't you see Frances?"

"No, why should I? If I know an American girl that lives in Strasbourg what the hell is it to Frances?"

"It doesn't make any difference. Any girl. I couldn't go, that would be all." "Don't be silly."

"You don't know Frances. Any girl at all. Didn't you see the way she looked?"

"Oh, well," I said, "let's go to Senlis." "Don't get sore."

"I'm not sore. Senlis is a good place and we can stay at the Grand Cerf and take a hike in the woods and come home."

"Good, that will be fine." "Well, I'll see you tomorrow at the courts," I said.

"Good-night, Jake," he said, and started back to the café? "You forgot to get your paper," I said.

"That's so." He walked with me up to the kiosque at the corner. "You are not sore, are you, Jake?" He turned with the paper in his hand.

"No, why should I be?" "See you at tennis," he said. I watched him walk back to the café? holding his paper.I rather liked him and evidently she led him quite a life.

> <font color=red>I rather liked him and evidently she led him quite a life.</font>
>
> 我挺喜欢他，可弗朗西丝显然弄得他的日子很不好过。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> quite a life 在这里有讽刺、调侃的意味，暗指quite a bad/terrible life；通常quite用于强调后面的名词有不寻常的地方（一般是正面的），比如：That was quite a party you had.（你的聚会搞得非常不错。）但这里结合语境应是在说反话。

### 背景知识

**💧1. About the author**

欧内斯特·米勒·海明威（Ernest Miller Hemingway，1899年7月21日－1961年7月2日），出生于美国伊利诺伊州芝加哥市郊区奥克帕克，美国作家、记者，被认为是20世纪最著名的小说家之一。

孩童时代的海明威喜欢读图画书和动物漫画，听各类型的故事。还承袭了父亲的兴趣，如打猎、钓鱼、在森林和湖泊中露营等。自高中起，海明威在写作上的天赋就已经崭露头角，因此18岁高中毕业时，又因为不愿意读大学，所以他便直接到了报社当记者开始写作生涯。

1918年，第一次世界大战爆发后，海明威不顾父亲的反对，辞掉了记者一职，并尝试加入美国军队以观察第一次世界大战的战斗情况。但是由于视力缺陷导致体检不及格，他最后被调到红十字会担任救护车司机。这段经历让海明威目睹了战争的残酷，他早期的小说《永别了，武器》（*Farewell to Arms*）的创作灵感便来源于此。

（1918年的海明威）

1921年，海明威娶了他的第一任妻子——哈德莉·理察逊（Hadley Richardson），并在9月迁到了芝加哥北部的三层公寓居住。到12月，海明威一家迁出国外。在巴黎居住的期间，海明威创作了《在我们的时代里》、《太阳照常升起》等作品。

（1926年一家三口）

离婚后，他迎娶了第二任妻子——宝琳·费孚（Pauline Pfeiffer），举家回到美国，过上了宁静的田园生活。

（1931到1939年间海明威在佛罗里达的居所）

1937年至1938年，他以战地记者的身份奔波于西班牙内战（Spanish Civil War）前线，创作了以美国人参加西班牙人民反法西斯战争为题材的长篇小说《丧钟为谁而鸣》（1940）。在第二次世界大战期间，他也作为记者随军行动，并参加了解放巴黎的战斗。

战后海明威客居古巴，潜心写作。1952年，《老人与海》问世，深受好评，翌年获普利策奖（Pulitzer Prize）. 1954年获贝尔文学奖。卡斯特罗掌权后，他离开古巴返美定居。因身上多处旧伤，百病缠身，精神忧郁，1961年7月2日用猎枪自杀。

**💧2. About the book**

《太阳照常升起》是海明威创作的第一部长篇小说，书名来自于扉页摘抄的《圣经》“传道书”中的经文：

One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.

The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.

一代过去、一代又来，地却永远长存。

日头出来、日头落下、急归所出之地。



The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.

风往南刮、又向北转、不住的旋转、而且返回转行原道。



All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.

江河都往海里流、海却不满．江河从何处流、仍归还何处。



小说本身以1924年至1925年这一历史时段和名城巴黎为背景，故事的主人公都在感情上遭受过创伤，或者因为战争而落下心理或生理机能障碍。作者描绘了他们在失落和绝望中放浪形骸，向醉生梦死、浮躁喧闹的生活方式寻求刺激和慰藉的精神状态，同时也展现了他们在一边愤世嫉俗一边寻求出路的努力。

故事的主要情节是美国青年巴恩斯（Jake Barnes）在第一次世界大战中脊椎受伤，失去性能力，战后在巴黎任记者时与英国人阿施利夫人（Lady Brett Ashley）相爱，夫人一味追求享乐，而他只能借酒浇愁。两人和一帮男女朋友去西班牙潘普洛纳（Pamplona）参加斗牛节，追求精神刺激。夫人拒绝了犹太青年科恩（Robert Cohn）的苦苦追求，却迷上了年仅十九岁的斗牛士罗梅罗（Romero）. 然而，在相处了一段日子以后，由于双方年龄实在悬殊，而阿施利夫人又不忍心毁掉纯洁青年的前程，这段恋情黯然告终。夫人最终回到了巴恩斯身边，尽管双方都清楚，彼此永远也不能真正地结合在一起。

借这本书，海明威成为了名副其实“迷惘的一代”的代言人，并以此书开创了海明威式的独特文风。关于“迷惘的一代”（The Lost Generation），这个称呼首先是美国文学评论家格特鲁德·斯坦因（Gertrude Stein）提出的对于第一次世界大战到第二次世界大战期间出现的美国一类作家的总称。《太阳照常升起》扉页上的题词就是她写的："You are all a lost generation"（你们都是迷惘的一代。）

“迷惘的一代”共同表现出的是对美国社会发展的一种失望和不满。他们之所以迷惘，是因为这一代人的传统价值观念完全不再适合战后的世界，可是他们又找不到新的生活准则。他们认为，只有现实才是真理，可现实是残酷的。于是他们只能按照自己的本能和感官行事，竭力反叛以前的理想和价值观，用叛逆思想和行为来表达他们对现实的不满。

但《太阳照常升起》不仅是“迷惘的一代”的代言作，对于今天身处迷惘以及有前卫和逆反青年、渴望独创艺术以及更加开放的心灵空间的读者来说，这本书也会让他们找到共鸣。

### 课文理解

和《了不起的盖茨比》相同，《太阳照常升起》也是以第一人称的口吻来写的，叙述者是Jake Barnes. 在一开篇，Jake没有交代自己的背景，而是先介绍了另一位主人公Robert Cohn. 根据Jake的描述，他们是Cohn再婚后搬到欧洲才认识的。Jake也是Cohn在法国唯二的朋友之一，俩人是网球的球友（During these three years, the first spent in travel, the last two in Paris, Robert Cohn had two friends, Braddocks and myself. Braddocks was his literary friend. I was his tennis friend）.

Cohn是一个非常有意思的人物，他的身上有很多矛盾点，比如他因为犹太人的身份在大学时期受到种族歧视而很怨愤，当通过学习拳击可以把那些目空一切的人击倒的时候，他的心里才稍微获得了一点平衡感，但他也只敢在拳击场上这么做（being very shy and a thoroughly nice boy, he never fought except in the gym）. 这种自卑感也影响到了他后来的择偶和婚姻——

💧**Clue 1**:   Cohn has been feeling inferior as being Jewish.



**Evidence 1**: He took it out in boxing, and he came out of Princeton with painful self-consciousness and the flattened nose, and was married by the first girl who was nice to him.

他在拳击中发泄这种情绪，他带着痛苦的自我意识和扁平的鼻子离开普林斯顿大学，碰到第一个待他好的姑娘就结了婚。

这个“待他好”的姑娘是否真的如此呢？下文提到了他的婚姻生活并不幸福：(he) hardened into a rather unattractive mould under domestic unhappiness with a rich wife. 这里面有两个细节，首先是他开始变得“冷酷无情，使人讨厌”，其次他们的婚姻不幸还跟他的妻子有钱有关。

需要补充的是，Cohn并不是一个穷小子出身，他的父母都来自非富即贵的显赫家族（through his father, of one of the richest Jewish families in New York, and through his mother of one of the oldest）, 只是他在父亲过世后挥霍无度，最后才变得没剩下几个钱。可以猜想他可能是因为失去家里的财政地位而处处受压制，或者是这个姑娘当初“对他好”只是觊觎他的家庭背景。俩人最后拆伙也非常戏剧化：



**Evidence 2**: As he had been thinking for months about leaving his wife and had not done it because it would be too cruel to deprive her of himself, her departure was a very healthful shock.

他已有好几个月尽考虑着要离开他的妻子，因为觉得使她失去他未免太残酷，所以没有那么做，因此她的出走对他倒是一次很有利的冲击。

Cohn把妻子的离家出走形容为一次“很有利的冲击”（a very healthful shock）, 因为在他看来，自己避免了主动对妻子造成伤害，所以虽然这件事给他带来了一定的影响，他反而觉得是很有益身心的。

在五年的婚姻告终后，他开始利用自己仅剩的积蓄投身到文艺界里。就在他资助一家文艺评论杂志的时候，他又被另一个想从他身上捞好处的女人（Frances）缠住了，后来她还半说服半强制地让Cohn把自己娶回家。但这个女人对他似乎也只有专横和占有欲，为了说明这个，Jake讲了一次三人一起吃饭的经历——



💧**Clue 2**: Frances is in control of Cohn's life.



**Evidence 1**: I suggested we fly to Strasbourg and walk up to Saint Odile, or somewhere or other in Alsace. "I know a girl in Strasbourg who can show us the town," I said. Somebody kicked me under the table.

我建议坐飞机到斯特拉斯堡，从那里步行到圣奥戴尔或者阿尔萨斯地区的什么别的地方。“我在斯特拉斯堡有个熟识的姑娘，她可以带我们观光这座城市，”我说。有人在桌子底下踢了我一脚。



**Evidence 2**: I was kicked again under the table and, looking, saw Frances, Robert's lady, her chin lifting and her face hardening.

在桌子下面我又挨了一脚，我一看，只见弗朗西丝，就是罗伯特的情人，撅着下巴 ，板着面孔呢。

当Jake提到可以让自己认识的一个姑娘作为地陪的时候，Cohn明显非常难紧张，所以连踢了Jake两脚。事后他还向Jake解释说，他无论如何也不能去的。（"It doesn't make any difference. Any girl. I couldn't go, that would be all."）而且不论是怎么样的女孩，都会引起Frances的不悦。（"You don't know Frances. Any girl at all. Didn't you see the way she looked?"）

Cohn是完全在Frances的掌控之中的（had been taken in hand），在他们结婚之前就是如此了，否则Frances也没有办法以自己“姿色日渐衰退”（her looks were going）为借口把自己嫁给Cohn. 所以在Jake看来，Cohn在Frances手里的日子真的很不好过。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧Iceberg Theory 冰山理论**

大多数人第一次读海明威的时候都会觉得故事太过寡淡无味、缺乏引人入胜的悬念，情节似乎也只是人物对话的堆砌。如果你也有这种感觉，那么说明你可能忽略了海明威其实采取了一种很特殊的写作策略，也就是依据所谓的“冰山理论”。

冰山理论（Iceberg Theory）指的是人的语言对于人的思想的表达就好像冰山一样，只有八分之一在水上面，有八分之七在水下；意思是说人的语言是不足以表达思想的，对于作者而言，也没有必要写得太过于直露，因为读者是能读懂的。它还有另一个名称，“省略理论”（Theory of Omission）, 这就已经足够说明了这个理论的目的就在于达成一种“简约艺术”。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/8730e9b8d891b0c896c99da811720df4-sz_74111.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)

但这种省略并不是简单的减少字数，或是刻意删减情节，它是有一定的原则的。海明威在自己的一篇文学评论“The Art of Short Story”里写道：

"A few things I have found to be true. If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened. If you leave or skip something because you do not know it, thestory will be worthless. The test of any story is how very good the stuff that you, not your editors, omit."

“我发现了几件事实：如果作者在作品里省略的是自己已知的信息，那么故事会有一种凝练感。但如果作者只是因为自己无从知晓而省略或跳过，那么故事最终就失去了价值。所以一个故事的好与坏，不在于出版社编辑删掉的那部分有多好，而是作者自己删掉的内容。”

所以关键在于作者要对自己想写的东西心里很有数，这样对于读者来说，只要作家写得真实，会强烈的感觉到他所省略的地方，好像作者已经把他们写出来了似的。

总而言之，“冰山理论”就是用简洁的文字塑造出鲜明的形象，把自身的感受和思想情绪最大限度的埋藏在形象之中，使之情感充沛却含而不露、思想深沉而隐而不晦，而将文学的可感性与可思性巧妙的结合起来，让读者对鲜明形象的感受去发掘作品的思想意义。

That winter Robert Cohn went over to America with his novel, and it was accepted by a fairly good publisher.

For four years his horizon had been absolutely limited to his wife. For three years, or almost three years, he had never seen beyond Frances.I am sure he had never been in love in his life.

He had married on the rebound from the rotten time he had in college, and Frances took him on the rebound from his discovery that he had not been everything to his first wife.

Also, playing for higher stakes than he could afford in some rather steep bridge games with his New York connections, he had held cards and won several hundred dollars.

It was all that was needed to set him off.

I did not realize the extent to which it had set him off until one day he came into my office.

"Hello, Robert," I said. "Did you come in to cheer me up?"

"Would you like to go to South America, Jake?" he asked.

"No.""Why not?""I don't know. I never wanted to go. Too expensive. You can see all the South Americans you want in Paris anyway."

"They're not the real South Americans."

"They look awfully real to me."

I had a boat train to catch with a week's mail stories, and only half of them written.

"No; listen, Jake. If I handled both our expenses, would you go to South America with me?"

"Why me?" "You can talk Spanish. And it would be more fun with two of us."

"No," I said, "I like this town and I go to Spain in the summertime."

"All my life I've wanted to go on a trip like that," Cohn said. He sat down. "I'll be too old before I can ever do it."

"Don't be a fool," I said. "You can go anywhere you want. You've got plenty of money."

"I know. But I can't get started."

"Cheer up," I said. "All countries look just like the moving pictures."

But I felt sorry for him. He had it badly.

"I can't stand it to think my life is going so fast and I'm not really living it."

"Nobody ever lives their life all the way up except bullfighters."

"I'm not interested in bull-fighters. That's an abnormal life. I want to go back in the country in South America. We could have a great trip."

"Did you ever think about going to British East Africa to shoot?" "No, I wouldn't like that." "I'd go there with you." "No; that doesn't interest me."

"That's because you never read a book about it. Go on and read a book all full of love affairs with the beautiful shiny black princesses."

"I want to go to South America." He had a hard, Jewish, stubborn streak.

"Come on down-stairs and have a drink." "Aren't you working?" "No," I said.

We went down the stairs to the café on the ground floor. I had discovered that was the best way to get rid of friends.

Once you had a drink all you had to say was: "Well, I've got to get back and get off some cables," and it was done.

It is very important to discover graceful exits like that in the newspaper business, where it is such an important part of the ethics that you should never seem to be working.

Anyway, we went down-stairs to the bar and had a whiskey and soda.

Cohn looked at the bottles in bins around the wall. "This is a good place," he said. "There's a lot of liquor," I agreed.

"Listen, Jake," he leaned forward on the bar.

"Don't you ever get the feeling that all your life is going by and you're not taking advantage of it? Do you realize you've lived nearly half the time you have to live already?"

"Yes, every once in a while."

"Do you know that in about thirty-five years more we'll be dead?"

"What the hell, Robert," I said. "What the hell."

"I'm serious." "It's one thing I don't worry about," I said. "You ought to." "I've had plenty to worry about one time or other. I'm through worrying."

"Well, I want to go to South America."

"Listen, Robert, going to another country doesn't make any difference. I've tried all that. You can't get away from yourself by moving from one place to another. There's nothing to that."

"But you've never been to South America."

"South America hell! If you went there the way you feel now it would be exactly the same. This is a good town. Why don't you start living your life in Paris?"

"I'm sick of Paris, and I'm sick of the Quarter."

"Stay away from the Quarter. Cruise around by yourself and see what happens to you."

"Nothing happens to me. I walked alone all one night and nothing happened except a bicycle cop stopped me and asked to see my papers."

"Wasn't the town nice at night?" "I don't care for Paris." So there you were.

I was sorry for him, but it was not a thing you could do anything about, because right away you ran up against the two stubbornnesses: South America could fix it and he did not like Paris.

He got the first idea out of a book, and I suppose the second came out of a book too.

"Well," I said, "I've got to go up-stairs and get off some cables."

"Do you really have to go?" "Yes, I've got to get these cables off."

"Do you mind if I come up and sit around the office?" "No, come on up."

He sat in the outer room and read the papers, and the Editor and Publisher and I worked hard for two hours.

Then I sorted out the carbons, stamped on a by-line, put the stuff in a couple of big manila envelopes and rang for a boy to take them to the Gare St. Lazare.

I went out into the other room and there was Robert Cohn asleep in the big chair.

He was asleep with his head on his arms. I did not like to wake him up, but I wanted to lock the office and shove off.

I put my hand on his shoulder. He shook his head. "I can't do it," he said, and put his head deeper into his arms. "I can't do it. Nothing will make me do it."

"Robert," I said, and shook him by the shoulder. He looked up. He smiled and blinked.

"Did I talk out loud just then?" "Something. But it wasn't clear." "God, what a rotten dream!" "Did the typewriter put you to sleep?"

"Guess so. I didn't sleep all last night." "What was the matter?" "Talking," he said.

I could picture it. I have a rotten habit of picturing the bedroom scenes of my friends.

We went out to the Café Napolitain to have an aperitif and watch the evening crowd on the Boulevard.

### 背景知识

**💧The Latin Quarter of Paris**

Cohn向Jake表示了自己迫切渴望离开巴黎，离开拉丁区，他对这个地方已经厌恶至极（"I'm sick of Paris, and I'm sick of the Quarter"）, 这就介绍到这本小说的主要情节发生地之一——巴黎拉丁区啦~

拉丁区处于巴黎五区和六区之间，以巴黎索邦大学（Université Paris-Sorbonne）为中心，从圣日耳曼德佩区（Saint-Germain-des-Prés）到卢森堡公园（Jardin du Luxembourg）. 拉丁区这个名字来源于中世纪这里以拉丁语做为教学语言。周围矗立着众多巴黎的高等学府（higher education establishments），所以也是巴黎最有文化和历史气息的地方。

（索邦大学）

而以拉丁区为核心的这片区域也被称为“左岸”（the Left Bank, 法语名是La Rive Gauche）, 也就是塞纳河的南边（south of the River Seine），北边则是“右岸”。这里要补充一点关于塞纳河的地理知识：塞纳河由东向西流经巴黎，在市中心走了一条抛物线——从东南流入，穿过圣路易岛、西堤岛，越过卢浮宫，到亚历山大三世大桥处达到顶点；然后转头向下，擦过埃菲尔铁塔，向西南方向奔出巴黎。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/49518272b225508375a4ab5ffeca0e79-sz_896756.gif)



右岸汇集的主要是高级百货商店、精品店及饭店，还有我们熟知的香榭丽舍大道、协和广场、凯旋门、卢浮宫等。而文化知识界则聚集在左岸，于是各种书店、出版社、小剧场、美术馆、博物馆等逐渐建立了起来。围绕这种社交氛围的咖啡馆、啤酒馆也应运而生，成了左岸知识文化人士重要的聚会场所。从紧靠赛纳河左岸的圣米歇尔大街开始，文化名人和先贤们光顾和聚会过的咖啡馆、酒吧遍布各个街区。



### 课文理解

Cohn是深受自卑之害的一个人，比如他的两段婚姻其实都不是他完全按照自己心意选择的。但有一次，尽管和Frances大吵了一架（His going made an awful row）, 他还是带着自己写的小说到了纽约。结果没想到一个相当不错的出版商收下了他的书（it was accepted by a fairly good publisher），并且他在纽约也受到了很多女人的欢迎，这让他非常飘飘然（it rather went to his head）. 

以及他又看了一本内容十分浪漫且天马行空的小说，这也更加激发了他蠢蠢欲动的心（It was all that need to set him off）. 他开始对生活和爱情充满了不切实际的期待——



💧**Clue 1**:  Cohn holds unrealistic expectations about life and love.



**Evidence 1**: He was not in love yet but he realized that he was an attractive quantity to women, and that the fact of a woman caring for him and wanting to live with him was not simply a divine miracle.

他至今没有真正恋爱过，但是意识到自己对女人来说是一个有魅力的人，有个女人喜欢他并愿意和他生活在一起，这不仅仅是一个神迹而已。



从纽约回来后，Cohn的视野不再局限于他的前妻和Frances，比如前四年里他的眼中只有前妻，而后三年里他除了Frances谁也看不见（For four years his horizon had been absolutely limited to his wife. For three years, or almost three years, he had never seen beyond Frances）. 但当他发现原来自己很招女人喜欢的时候，自信心马上爆棚，这也让他不再对Frances形成依赖，或者受她的控制。



**Evidence 2**: It made him rather vain of his bridge game, and he talked several times of how a man could always make a living at bridge if he were ever forced to.

这使他很为自己的牌技洋洋自得，他几次谈起，一个人迫不得已的话，总是可以靠打桥牌为生的。

Cohn这种盲目的乐观还反映在了生活上。比如只是有几次他下的赌注比较大（playing for higher stakes than he could afford）, 还拿到了几张好牌，所以赢了几百块美元，他就觉得自己是桥牌高手并且能以此为生了。

恰巧他又读了一本充满异域奇想的小说，虽然对于里面的内容不是全盘接受（he made some reservations）, 但他已经大致相信里面所讲的都是言之有理的了（but on the whole the book to him was sound）. 所以有一天他就来到Jake的办公室，想邀请他一起到南美去。在两个人的对话中，Jake的很多话都意味深长，充满了神秘感——



💧**Clue 2**: Mysteries are built about Jake.



**Evidence 1**: "I can't stand it to think my life is going so fast and I'm not really living it."

"Nobody ever lives their life all the way up except bullfighters."

“一想到我的生命消逝得这么迅速，而我并不是在真正地活着，我就受不了。”

“除了斗牛士，没有一个人的人生是一路高歌猛进的。”



Jake对人生似乎没有抱有太过激情、浪漫的期待，所以对他来说，即便三十五年之后自己就会死去（"Do you know that in about thirty-five years more we'll be dead?"）他也丝毫无所谓（"It's one thing I don't worry about," I said.）而且他在这里莫名提到了斗牛士，也让Cohn很费解（"I'm not interested in bull-fighters. That's an abnormal life."）



**Evidence 2**: "Listen, Robert, going to another country doesn't make any difference. I've tried all that. You can't get away from yourself by moving from one place to another. There's nothing to that."

“听我说，罗伯特，到别的国家去也是这么样。我都试过。从一个地方挪到另一个地方，你做不到自我解脱。毫无用处。”



这段话里面有一个关键：“I've tried all that.” 读到这里，好奇心一下就被激发：什么样的人生经历让他对这种乐观心态抱有如此大的幻灭感呢？而且在Jake看来，如果心态还是一样，那么即便到了南美也不会有所好转，所以Cohn应该从在巴黎的生活开始重整旗鼓（"If you went there the way you feel now it would be exactly the same. This is a good town. Why don't you start living your life in Paris?"）.

其实这种人物刻画方式就是海明威“冰山理论”的一个典型运用：不是平铺直叙，而是把人物的性格和经历都隐藏在对话的细微末节里。这对读者也是一大考验，因为需要更多的细心和感受力来构建人物的立体形象。有挑战，但也非常有趣~

### 今日彩蛋

**💧Famous Boulevards around the world**



We went out to the Café Napolitain to have an aperitif and watch the evening crowd on the Boulevard.（我们上街到那波利咖啡馆去喝了一杯开胃酒，然后看着黄昏时林荫大道上散步的人群。）

我们在背景里对巴黎的拉丁区做了介绍，这里聚集着大大小小的休闲咖啡馆。除此之外，我们看到Cohn和Jake还一边坐着观望人流如织的“林荫大道”（Boulevard）.

大家可能对Boulevard这个词比较陌生。虽然是法语词，但它其实源自荷兰语（Dutch）的Bolwerk, 这个词本来是指“堡垒”（bastion）, 通常缩写为Blvd. 后来用来指非常宽大的马路（broad street），两旁树木林立（planted with rows of trees）, 而且往往是贯穿整个城市的（usually running through a city）.

那么世界上都有哪些著名的“林荫大道”呢？今天的彩蛋我们就来看一看~



**1. Champs-Elysées (Paris, France)**

**香榭丽舍大道**

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/fbfa9c300a953fd4e1ecc6ddaa1d7458-sz_289291.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



香榭丽舍大道，位于巴黎市中心商业繁华区，其法文是AVENUE DES CHAMPS ELYSEES. 其中CHAMPS（香）意为田园，ELYSEES（爱丽舍）之意为“极乐世界”或“乐土”，在英文里就是Elysian Fields. “极乐世界”在希腊神话里被认为是英雄们死后所进入的天堂（the paradise for dead heroes）.



她位于卢浮宫与新凯旋门（the Arc de Triomphe）连心中轴线上，又被称为凯旋大道。并且横贯首都巴黎的东西主干道，全长1800米，最宽处约120米，为双向八车道，东起协和广场（the Place de la Concorde），西至戴高乐广场（the Place Charles de Gaulle），东段以自然风光为主；两侧是平坦的英氏草坪，恬静安宁；西段是高级商业区，世界品牌、服装店、香水店都集中在这里（prestigious and luxurious shops are seen in every turn）.

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/304c54063cafc100d9cc7a0e124c382a-sz_367063.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



**2. Lombard Street (San Francisco, USA)**

**九曲花街**

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/902d292a24d2530836a396a51394b9d8-sz_313020.jpeg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



九曲花街的美国官方正式名称为伦巴底街（Lombard Street）. 她位于美国加州圣弗朗西斯科，是一条东西方向贯穿Presidio区及Cow Hollow区的街道。其部分路段（从Broderick街到Van Ness大道）更是美国101高速公路的干线（a major thoroughfare designated as part of U.S. Route 101）. 该街道一直向东伸展，经过俄罗斯山、电报山后，尽头是圣弗朗西斯科海傍的Embarcadero区域。



九曲花街其实很长，但她在Hyde街与Leavenworth街之间的一个很短的街区，却有八个急转弯（eight sharp turns），所以也被称为全世界最弯曲的一条街道（"the crookedest street in the world"）. 而且因为有40度的斜坡，且弯曲像“Z”字形，所以车子只能往下单行。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/76bd7ca2c43809d5f380fa3907ec30f6-sz_201476.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



**3. Michigan Avenue (Chicago, USA)**

**密歇根大街**

密歇根大街是芝加哥市一条南北方向主干道（a north-south street），街道沿途有芝加哥水塔（Chicago Water Tower）、芝加哥艺术学院（Art Institute of Chicago）、千禧公园（Millennium Park）以及“华丽一英里”（Magnificent Mile）. 该街道如今已是芝加哥市一条著名的商业街（the main commercial street），梦露雕像就在这条街上。



密歇根大街桥（Michigan Avenue Bridge）也值得一提，该桥于1920年正式通车，是连接芝加哥南部和北部重要的交通枢纽。

**4. The Strip (Las Vegas, USA)**

**长街（拉斯维加斯大道）**

首先要介绍一下拉斯维加斯的地理区域分布，整个城市分为拉斯维加斯大街（Strip）、老城区（Downtown）以及拉斯维加斯湖区（Lake Las Vegas），尤其是拉斯维加斯大街，以两侧分布着诸多巨型的高级酒店和赌场（resort hotels and casinos）而闻名于世。



世界上十家最大型的度假旅馆在拉斯维加斯就有九间，最大间的就是有5005间房及主题公园的米高美大酒店（MGM Grand Adventure Hotel and Casino）.

乌节路原为一条不知名的乡间小路。1830年初期，路两旁大多为肉豆蔻农场（nutmeg）、胡椒园（pepper）和果园（fruit orchard）.



而今，它已然成为一条风情万种的时尚大街和旅游景点（a major shopping belt and tourist attraction）——全长2.2公里，大道两旁遍布购物中心、餐馆和酒店，从奢华名牌到平价时尚、星级餐厅到连锁速食，应有尽有。

It was a warm spring night and I sat at a table on the terrace of the Napolitain after Robert had gone, watching it get dark and the electric signs come on,

and the red and green stop-and-go traffic-signal, and the crowd going by, and the horse-cabs clippety-clopping along at the edge of the solid taxi traffic,

and the poules (妓女) going by, singly and in pairs, looking for the evening meal.

I watched a good-looking girl walk past the table and watched her go up the street and lost sight of her, and watched another, and then saw the first one coming back again.

She went by once more and I caught her eye, and she came over and sat down at the table. The waiter came up.

>
> 也可以表示“使某人产生兴趣”（to attract one's interest）, 一般是通过外表视觉上的吸引（to be visually appealing）, 比如：I see that the new girl in school has caught your eye.（我发现你对那个新来的女孩很感兴趣。）

"Well, what will you drink?" I asked. "Pernod."

"That's not good for little girls."

"Little girl yourself. Dites garcon, un pernod (服务员，来一杯茴香酒)."

"A pernod for me, too." "What's the matter?" she asked. "Going on a party?"

"Sure. Aren't you?" "I don't know. You never know in this town."

"Don't you like Paris?" "No."

"Why don't you go somewhere else?" "Isn't anywhere else."

"You're happy, all right." "Happy, hell!"

Pernod is greenish imitation absinthe. When you add water it turns milky.

I paid for the saucers and we walked out to the street. I hailed a horse-cab and the driver pulled up at the curb.

Settled back in the slow, smoothly rolling fiacre (马车) we moved up the Avenue de l'Opéra (歌剧院大街),passed the locked doors of the shops, their windows lighted, the Avenue broad and shiny and almost deserted.

The cab passed the New York Herald (《先驱报》) bureau with the window full of clocks.

> ==bureau英 [ˈbjʊərəʊ] 美 [ˈbjʊroʊ] n. 局；（提供某方面信息的）办事处；（美国政府部门）局；（附抽屉及活动写字台的）书桌==

"What are all the clocks for?" she asked.

"They show the hour all over America." "Don't kid me."

We turned off the Avenue up the Rue des Pyramides (金字塔街), through the traffic of the Rue de Rivoli (丽弗里街), and through a dark gate into the Tuileries (杜伊勒利宫).

She cuddled against me and I put my arm around her. She looked up to be kissed.

> ==cuddle英 [ˈkʌdl] 美 [ˈkʌdl:] vt.& vi. 拥抱，怀抱 vi. 依偎着睡==

She touched me with one hand and I put her hand away.

"Never mind." "What's the matter? You sick?"

"Yes." "Everybody's sick. I'm sick, too."

We came out of the Tuileries into the light and crossed the Seine and then turned up the Rue des Saints Péres (教皇路).

"You oughtn't to drink pernod if you're sick." "You neither."

"It doesn't make any difference with me. It doesn't make any difference with a woman."

"What are you called?" "Georgette. How are you called?"

"Jacob." "That's a Flemish name." "American too."

"You're not Flamand?" "No, American." "Good, I detest Flamands."

> ==detest英 [dɪˈtest] 美 [dɪˈtɛst] vt. 憎恶，嫌恶，痛恨==

By this time we were at the restaurant. I called to the cocher (车夫) to stop. We got out and Georgette did not like the looks of the place.

"This is no great thing of a restaurant." "No," I said.

"Maybe you would rather go to Foyot's. Why don't you keep the cab and go on?"

I had picked her up because of a vague sentimental idea that it would be nice to eat with some one.

It was a long time since I had dined with a poule, and I had forgotten how dull it could be.

We went into the restaurant, passed Madame Lavigne at the desk and into a little room. Georgette cheered up a little under the food.

"It isn't bad here," she said. "It isn't chic, but the food is all right."

> ==chic==
>
> adj. 别致的；<法>漂亮的，时髦的
>
> 原文："It isn't chic, but the food is all right."

> “说不上时髦，不过饭菜还不错。”
>
> 💧chic这个词也来自于法语，不仅指普通的“时髦漂亮”（stylish），还是非常“高贵雅致”的（elegant）. “都市时髦”就是urban chic.
>
> 💧此外chic还可以指“某个行业或领域里的兴趣或潮流”，比如：The academic chic is transient.（学术界的研究兴趣是一直在改变的。）

"Better than you eat in Liege (列日，比利时东部大城市)." "Brussels, you mean."

We had another bottle of wine and Georgette made a joke. She smiled and showed all her bad teeth, and we touched glasses.

"You're not a bad type," she said. "It's a shame you're sick. We get on well. What's the matter with you, anyway?"

"I got hurt in the war," I said. "Oh, that dirty war."

We would probably have gone on and discussed the war and agreed that it was in reality a calamity for civilization, and perhaps would have been better avoided.

I was bored enough. Just then from the other room some one called: "Barnes! I say, Barnes! Jacob Barnes!

"It's a friend calling me," I explained,and went out.

There was Braddocks at a big table with a party: Cohn, Frances Clyne, Mrs. Braddocks, several people I did not know.

"You're coming to the dance, aren't you?" Braddocks asked.

"What dance?" "Why, the dancings. Don't you know we've revived them?" Mrs. Braddocks put in.

> ==revive英 [rɪˈvaɪv] 美 [rɪˈvaɪv] vt. 使复活，使恢复；使振奋，复原==

You must come, Jake. We're all going," Frances said from the end of the table. She was tall and had a smile.

"Of course, he's coming," Braddocks said. "Come in and have coffee with us, Barnes."

"Right." "And bring your friend," said Mrs. Braddocks laughing. She was a Canadian and had all their easy social graces.

> *graces还经常以短语airs and graces的形式出现，带有贬义，指“装腔作势，矫揉造作”，比如：She's very rich, but she doesn't give herself any airs and graces.（她很有钱，但从来不摆出装腔作势的样子。）

"Thanks, we'll be in," I said. I went back to the small room.

"Who are your friends?" Georgette asked.

"Writers and artists." "There are lots of those on this side of the river."

"Too many." "I think so. Still, some of them make money."

"Oh, yes." We finished the meal and the wine. "Come on," I said.

"We're going to have coffee with the others."

Georgette opened her bag, made a few passes at her face as she looked in the little mirror, re-defined her lips with the lip-stick, and straightened her hat.<br>"Good," she said.

"Good," she said. We went into the room full of people and Braddocks and the men at his table stood up.

"I wish to present my fiancée, Mademoiselle Georgette Leblanc," I said. Georgette smiled that wonderful smile, and we shook hands all round.

"Are you related to Georgette Leblanc, the singer?" Mrs. Braddocks asked.

"No," said Georgette. "Not at all. My name is Hobin."

"But Mr. Barnes introduced you as Mademoiselle Georgette Leblanc. Surely he did," insisted Mrs. Braddocks, who in the excitement of talking French was liable to have no idea what she was saying.

"He's a fool," Georgette said. "Oh, it was a joke, then," Mrs. Braddocks said.

"Yes," said Georgette. "To laugh at."

"Did you hear that, Henry?" Mrs. Braddocks called down the table to Braddocks. "Mr. Barnes introduced his fiancee as Mademoiselle Leblanc, and her name is actually Hobin."

"Of course, darling. Mademoiselle Hobin, I've known her for a very long time."

"Oh, Mademoiselle Hobin," Frances Clyne calIed, speaking French very rapidly and not seeming so proud and astonished as Mrs. Braddocks at its coming out really French.

>
> *its (the speaking's)  coming out是“形容词性物主代词+doing”的结构。

"Have you been in Paris long? Do you like it here? You love Paris, do you not?"

"Who's she?" Georgette turned to me. "Do I have to talk to her?"

She turned to Frances, sitting smiling, her hands folded, her head poised on her long neck, her lips pursed ready to start talking again.

"No, I don't like Paris. It's expensive and dirty."

"Really? I find it so extraordinarily clean. One of the cleanest cities in all Europe." "I find it dirty."

"How strange! But perhaps you have not been here very long."

"I've been here long enough." "But it does have nice people in it. One must grant that."

Georgette turned to me. "You have nice friends."

Frances was a little drunk and would have liked to have kept it up but the coffee came, and Lavigne with the liqueurs (利口酒), and after that we all went out and started for Braddocks's dancing-club.

### 背景知识

**💧Le Café Napolitain 那不勒斯咖啡馆**

在昨天的背景里我们介绍到左岸（The Left Bank）是巴黎的文化艺术中心，自然咖啡馆也是满街林立的。法国人本身爱喝咖啡，到什么程度呢？——他们会自我调侃道：“我不在咖啡馆，就是去咖啡馆的路上。”

由此也催生出了蓬勃的街头咖啡（pavement cafe）文化，很多咖啡馆都是直接开在人行道边上，室外支个阳伞或雨棚。一般全天24小时不歇业，提供早餐和夜宵，行人可以随时停下来歇脚喝杯咖啡，跟我们的“大排档”很类似。

而咖啡馆之于巴黎的文人墨客，更是是灵魂休憩、思想碰撞的地方。比如我们的小说主角们十分喜欢的这家咖啡馆Napolitain Café（那不勒斯咖啡馆），就大有来头。

Napolitain也可以写成Neapolitain, 本义是指“那不勒斯（人）的”。那不勒斯（Naples）是意大利南部的一座城市，以其丰富的历史、文化、艺术和美食而著称。据说那不勒斯咖啡馆的老板会给每位到店的客人赠送一份意大利冰激凌。

这座那不勒斯咖啡馆就坐落在巴黎卡布辛大道1号（number 1 Boulevard des Capucines）, 这里也是巴黎的四大林荫大道之一（one of the four "Grands Boulevards"）. 它的装饰风格以“军事”为主题（with a military theme），这是为了庆祝1892年“法俄同盟”（Franco-Russian Alliance）的成立。

除了海明威本人在1921到1928年居住巴黎的期间经常光临（frequented）这家咖啡馆，许多著名的艺术家和作者也聚集（congregated）在此高谈阔论，比如提出“迷惘的一代”称号的美国作家（Gertrude Stein）, 法国后印象派三大巨匠之一的保罗·高更（Paul Gauguin）, 西班牙现代派画家巴勃罗·毕加索（Pablo Picasso）, 以及美国意象派诗人的鼻祖埃兹拉·庞德（Ezra Pound）.

除了那不勒斯咖啡馆，巴黎还有不少文艺工作者们青睐的咖啡馆。比如蒙巴纳斯街上的丁香咖啡馆（la closerie des lilas）, 这里的常客包括美国作家亨利·米勒（Henry Miller）和爱尔兰作家詹姆斯·乔伊斯（James Joyce）, 当然还包括海明威。比如时值今日，这家咖啡馆还保留着海明威经常坐的椅子，椅背上的铜牌镌刻着他的名字。

在圣日耳曼教堂对面的花神咖啡馆（Café de Flore）和它隔壁的双偶咖啡馆（Les Deux Magots）则是存在主义大师萨特（Sartre）和波伏娃（Beauvoir）日常讨论和写作的地方。正是坐在花神咖啡馆临街的窗口，波伏娃给她的美国情人奥尔格伦写下了那些热烈的情书。

### 课文理解

一个温暖的春日夜晚，Jake坐在那不勒斯咖啡馆的露天平台上百无聊赖，打量着街道上的景象和人来人往。一个妓女似乎是被他吸引住了，想着多一个饭友不是坏事，于是他便邀请这个叫Georgette的姑娘一同去吃饭。在马车上，Georgette主动地搂抱住他，想要和他继续亲热，但Jake却拒绝了。这个细节在整本小说中都非常重要，也可以说它向我们揭示了关于Jake的一个致命弱点——



💧**Clue 1**: Jake is physically impotent, especially in a sexual sense.



**Evidence 1**: She looked up to be kissed. She touched me with one hand and I put her hand away.

"Never mind."

"What's the matter? You sick?"

"Yes."

"Everybody's sick. I'm sick, too."

她抬头期待我的亲吻。她伸手摸我，我把她的手推开。

“别这样。”

“怎么啦？你有病？”

“是的。”

“谁没病？我也有病。”



**Evidence 2**: "You're not a bad type," she said. "It's a shame you're sick. We get on well. What's the matter with you, anyway?"

"I got hurt in the war," I said.

“你这人不坏，”她说，“真可惜你染上了病。咱们挺说得来。不过你到底会怎么弄的？”

“是在战场上受了伤。”我说。



Jake在这里很隐晦地表明了自己有身体的不适或毛病，sick这个词很宽泛模糊，在这里的语境下可以有不只一种暗指。并且他说“Everybody's sick. I'm sick, too.”的时候口气明显敷衍。直到Georgette再一次不识时务地提起这个话题，他才透露自己是在战场上受了伤。关于这段具体的经历他其实也很避讳提起——



💧**Clue 2**: Jake is not that willing to talk about his past.



**Evidence 1**: We would probably have gone on and discussed the war and agreed that it was in reality a calamity for civilization, and perhaps would have been better avoided. I was bored enough.

我们本来会继续谈下去，会议论那次大战，会一致认为战争实质上是对文明的一场浩劫，也许最好能避免战争。我厌烦透了。



想到那场战争以及其遗留的伤害让他变得很不耐烦，这也是到目前为止我们在Jake身上感受到的一种很明显的特质——沉闷易怒。比如在前面和Cohn的对话中，他不声不响地就给Cohn泼了一头冷水，并且还以“I've tried all that”这样的话来打发他，但他往往在说到涉及个人经历的时候就戛然而止了，明显不想过多地谈论自己的过去。



那么到底是什么样的经历造就了这样的Jake呢？明天的故事里我们就会看到答案。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧可能是最“走心”的英文词根了：cor/cour/cord**



"But you have the same name," Mrs. Braddocks insisted cordially.（“可是你们俩同名同姓，”布雷克多斯太太真诚地说。）

cordially表示“真情实意地”，它的含义是从词根cord延伸出来的：cord在拉丁语里表示heart, 所以cordial表示with heart, “用心地”，也就是对别人掏心掏肺啦~

其实cord这个词根还可以再深究，它最早的形式是cor, 后来才变形延伸出了cour以及cord. 这三个词根都是和心脏有关的，我们来分别看一下~



**💧由cor形成的词汇**



core

由cor构成的主要就是这个词根本身啦~当它作名词的时候，从“心脏”这个含义延伸出了“果心，果核”、“（组织的）核心成员”以及抽象意义上的“核心，最重要的部分”，比如：

Debt is at the core of the problem.

债务是问题的关键。

还有一句俚语表达：to the core, 表示“……深入到内核、本质”，也就是“彻底地，完全地”（extremely and completely）, 比如：

That woman is rotten to the core!

那个女人坏透了！

It hurt me to the core.



He was a bureaucrat to the core.

他是个十足的官僚。

除此之外，core作形容词可以表示“主要的，核心的”，比如core curriculum（核心课程），core business（核心业务），core values（核心价值观）等等。



**💧由cour形成的词汇**



courage (courageous, encourage, discourage)

courage起初由拉丁语进入法语，在这个过程中经历了一系列的变形：cor (拉丁语)→coraticum (通俗/平民拉丁语)→corage (古法语)→corage (中世纪英语)→courage (现代英语)

从14世纪开始，corage的含义就不再仅限于指“心脏”这一身体器官了，而引申出了表示“人的心理状态，想法，品性”等。比如：*bold* *corage* (brave heart “勇敢”); *fre* *corage* (free will “自由意志”); *wikked* *corage* (wicked/evil heart “坏心肠”) 等。



但今天courage的含义大大缩小，就只有*bold corage*这层表示“勇气”的意思啦~



**💧由cord形成的词汇**



\1. concord

con表示with, together; 所以con+cord在字面上的意思是hearts together, 引申为with the same mind. 

大家都想到一起去了，也就是达成“一致，协调”，相当于harmony, 比如：

The marital rift was short lasting, ending in concord.

婚姻生活的不和谐持续了一小段时间，但最终还是归于和睦。

concord的另一层意思是“共识，协议”，相当于agreement, treaty.

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/d27c39478865e44e13b93940042d9c8d-sz_76111.jpg?x-oss-process=image/resize,w_1080/auto-orient,1/crop,x_0,y_194,w_620,h_206)



\2. accord

accord的含义和concord很相近。首先看ac-这个前缀来自ad-, 表示to; 所以ac+cord就是指bring heart to heart, 引申为come into agreement, be in harmony.

accord作名词可以表示“符合，一致”，比如：

These results are in accord with earlier research.

这些结果和先前的研究一致。

同时和concord一样也可以表示“协议”，比如：

The union reached an accord with management at 4: 30 this afternoon.

工会于今天下午4点30分和管理层达成了协议。

accord还有一个非常好用的表达：of one's own accord, “出于自己本心的”也就是follow one's heart啦~

引申为“自愿地，主动地”（voluntarily, without being forced），比如：

He decided to go of his own accord.

他是自己决定要去的。

The door seemed to move of its own accord.

那扇门似乎自己在动。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/7e9547b9de52a249a09abe379e9186aa-sz_3022768.jpg?x-oss-process=image/resize,w_1080/auto-orient,1/crop,x_0,y_115,w_1080,h_353/format,jpg)



\3. discordant

介绍完前面的两个，这个单词就很好理解了。dis-是表示否定的前缀，-ant是形容词后缀，连起来理解是“在本质上不相融，不和谐的”（conflicting in nature）, 相当于contradictory.



这种不和谐可以指听觉/音乐上的，比如：

Modern classical music just sounds discordant to me. 

现代的古典音乐在我听来就是不和谐。



或者是某物和周围的环境不协调，比如：

The modern decor strikes a discordant note in this old building.

现代化的装潢与这座古老的建筑本身很不协调。

（strike a discordant note这个表达也是从音乐里面引申出来的：note表示音符，strike就是敲打、弹奏)

*还有一个很常见的单词也是由cord构成的，大家想到了不妨也去查一查词源了解它的由来哦，也欢迎和老师一起分享~（给大家推荐一个英文的词源网站：Online Etymology Dictionary）

The dancing-club was a bal musette(小风琴舞会) in the Rue de la Montagne Sainte Genevieve (圣朱维夫山之路).

Five nights a week the working people of the Pantheon (先贤祠) quarter danced there.

One night a week it was the dancingclub.

On Monday nights it was closed.

When we arrived it was quite empty, except for a policeman sitting near the door, the wife of the proprietor back of the zinc bar, and the proprietor himself.

> ==proprietor英 [prəˈpraɪətə(r)] 美 [prəˈpraɪɪtɚ] n. 所有人，业主；地主==

The daughter of the house came down-stairs as we went in.

There were long benches, and tables ran across the room, and at the far end a dancing-floor.

"I wish people would come earlier," Braddocks said.

The daughter came up and wanted to know what we would drink.

The proprietor got up on a high stool beside the dancing-floor and began to play the accordion.

> ==accordion英 [əˈkɔ:diən] 美 [əˈkɔ:rdiən] n. 手风琴==

He had a string of bells around one of his ankles and beat time with his foot as he played

Every one danced. It was hot and we came off the floor perspiring.

"My God," Georgette said. "What a box to sweat in!"

> <font color=red>"My God," Georgette said. "What a box to sweat in!"</font>
>
> “我的上帝，”乔杰特说。“屋里活像个蒸笼！”

> "What a box to sweat in!"不是指大家在盒子里大汗淋漓。box有“包厢”（一般空间狭小）的意思，比如剧院里的包厢就是用box来代指。但这里的box还不只是指包厢，结合后面的sweat, 这里指的很可能是sweat box, 也就是桑拿房（sauna bar）.
>
> *作者没有直接写明是sweat box其实也是为了营造一定的想象空间，同时利用box的多个歧义：“盒子”、“包厢”等，来暗示这个俱乐部里边空间很小，人挤人的非常闷热。 

"It's hot."

"Hot, my God!"

"Take off your hat."

"That's a good idea."

Some one asked Georgette to dance, and I went over to the bar.

It was really very hot and the accordion music was pleasant in the hot night.

I drank a beer, standing in the doorway and getting the cool breath of wind from the street.

Two taxis were coming down the steep street.

They both stopped in front of the Bal.

A crowd of young men, some in jerseys and some in their shirt-sleeves, got out.

I could see their hands and newly washed, wavy hair in the light from the door.

The policeman standing by the door looked at me and smiled

They came in. As they went in, under the light I saw white hands, wavy hair, white faces, grimacing, gesturing, talking.

> ==grimace英 [grɪˈmeɪs] 美 [ˈɡrɪmɪs, ɡrɪˈmes] n. 鬼脸，怪相；痛苦的表情 vi. 扮怪相，做鬼脸==

With them was Brett.

She looked very lovely and she was very much with them.

> <font color=red>She looked very lovely and she was very much with them.</font>
>
> 她模样怪可爱的，还和他们打成了一片。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> she was very much with them 可能有点难理解，这里very much是俚语的一种用法，表示强调，我们先来看一个句子：She is very much in control of the situation.（她正掌控着情况。）
>
> 因此原文里very much可以看成是强调she was “with” them. 也就是她跟他们在一起一点都不奇怪违和，看上去很玩得来。

One of them saw Georgette and said: "I do declare. There is an actual harlot. I'm going to dance with her, Lett. You watch me."

The tall dark one, called Lett, said: "Don't you be rash.".

The wavy blond one answered: "Don't you worry, dear." And with them was Brett.

I was very angry. Somehow they always made me angry.

I know they are supposed to be amusing, and you should be tolerant, but I wanted to swing on one, any one, anything to shatter that superior, simpering composure.

>
> I’m not supposed to tell anyone. 我不能告诉任何人的。
>
> He’s supposed to be very clever. 据说他非常聪明。
>
> ②to swing on one, any one, anything to shatter...调整语序后是：to swing anything on one, any one, to shatter...（不定式结构在这里作目的状语）；swing sth on/at sb表示“抡起……向某人砸去”，swing本义是“摇摆，摇动”，所以表示击打这个动作的时候就是抡圆了胳膊朝对方挥过去；这里的sth在原文里就是anything;
>
> ③to shatter that superior, simpering composure“来砸掉那种目中无人、傻笑中透着泰然自若的神情”；shatter表示“使粉碎，破灭”，比如“打破宁静”就是shatter the silence/peace；superior也就是“高傲的，有优越感的”；simpering指“傻笑的”，但一般带有贬义，形容的是很矫揉造作地装无辜的傻笑；composure表示“冷静，镇定”（calmness）.
>
> *Jake看到和Brett同行的这些男性对Georgette的态度的非常轻佻，更加对他们感觉厌恶和不满。比如他们直呼Georgette为harlot（妓女，荡妇），以及故意跟她跳舞捉弄她（"I'm going to dance with her, Lett. You watch me."The tall dark one, called Lett, said: "Don't you be rash." The wavy blond one answered: "Don't you worry, dear."）

Instead, I walked down the street and had a beer at the bar at the next Bal.

The beer was not good and I had a worse cognac to take the taste Out of my mouth

When I came back to the Bal there was a crowd on the floor and Georgette was dancing with the tall blond youth, who danced big-hippily,carrying his head on one side, his eyes lifted as he danced.

As soon as the music stopped another one of them asked her to dance.

She had been taken up by them.

I knew then that they would all dance with her.

They are like that.

I sat down at a table.

Cohn was sitting there. Frances was dancing.

Mrs. Braddocks brought up somebody and introduced him as Robert Prentiss.

He was from New York by way of Chicago, and was a rising new novelist.

He had some sort of an English accent. I asked him to have a drink.

"Thanks so much," he said, "I've just had one."

"Have another." "Thanks, I will then."

We got the daughter of the house over and each had a fine a l'eau (兑水的白兰地).

"You're from Kansas City, they tell me," he said.

"Yes."Do you find Paris amusing?"

"Yes."Really?"

I was a little drunk. Not drunk in any positive sense but just enough to be careless.

> <font color=red>I was a little drunk. Not drunk in any positive sense but just enough to be careless.</font>
>
> 我已有几分醉意。并没有真醉，但说起话来已经到了口不择言的程度。

> ①in any positive sense “没有真的”；positive在这里表示“肯定的，确信的”（certain）, 还可以直接作为问题的答语，比如：‘Are you sure about that?’ ‘Positive.’（“那事你能肯定吗？”“能。”）
>
> ②but just enough to 直译是“但是刚好能够做”，在这里应该理解为“但是已经到了什么样的程度”，两种理解的语气不同；第一种是你希望有足够的什么东西，而当下的情况是刚好够；第二种则相反，你反而不希望有那么多。所以这里的语气表示的是：虽然没有完全醉，但已经足够到不择词句的地步了。

"For God's sake," I said, "yes. Don't you?"

"Oh, how charmingly you get angry," he said. "I wish I had that faculty."

>
> She had a great faculty for absorbing information.

> 她吸收信息的能力很强。

I got up and walked over toward the dancing-floor.

Mrs. Braddocks followed me. "Don't be cross with Robert," she said.

"He's still only a child, you know."

"I wasn't cross," I said. "I just thought perhaps I was going to throw up."

"Your fiancé is having a great success," Mrs. Braddocks looked out on the floor where Georgette was dancing in the arms of the tall, dark one, called Lett.

"Isn't she?" I said."Rather," said Mrs. Braddocks.

Cohn came up. "Come on, Jake," he said, "have a drink."

We walked over to the bar. "What's the matter with you? You seem all worked up over something?"

> <font color=red>"What's the matter with you? You seem all worked up over something?"</font>
>
> “你怎么啦？好像被什么事惹火了。”

>
> ①all 在这里表示“非常，甚”（pretty much）, 主要用于强调不好的情形，常和too连用，比如：In these conditions it was all too easy to make mistakes. 在这些情况下很容易犯错。
>
> ②work sb up 表示“激起某人情绪”（to arouse one's emotions）, 尤其指“使某人生气”，后面的over表示“因为什么事情”，比如：
>
> I think you're working yourself up over nothing. I'm sure the doctor will tell you it's nothing.
>
> 我觉得你是在毫无理由地发脾气。我敢肯定，医生会告诉你这其实没什么大不了的。

"Nothing. This whole show makes me sick is all."

Brett came up to the bar. "Hello, you chaps."

"Hello, Brett," I said. "Why aren't you tight?"

> <font color=red>"Hello, Brett," I said. "Why aren't you tight?"</font>
>
> “嗨，勃莱特，”我说。“你怎么没喝醉？”
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> tight 在这里是一种过时的俚语表达，意思是“喝醉的”（drunk）. 再为大家拓展几个关于tight的地道用法：
>
> 表示“（胸/胃/喉）感觉憋闷的，不适的”：这个很好理解，feel tight也就是感觉某个部位难受地发紧”；比如：
>
> Before she went on stage her chest felt tight and her throat hurt.
>
> 她上台前胸口发闷，喉咙疼痛。
>
> 表示“生气的，担忧的”：可以和“紧闭双唇”这个动作联系起来，因此tight-lipped不是因为闷闷不乐，就是因为太过担心而勉强挤出笑容；比如：
>
> ‘Look, I’m sorry…,’ she said, forcing a tight smile.
>
> “噢，我很抱歉……”她说道，勉强挤出一丝生硬的笑容。

"Never going to get tight any more. I say, give a chap a brandy and soda."

She stood holding the glass and I saw Robert Cohn looking at her.

He looked a great deal as his compatriot must have looked when he saw the promised land.

> ==compatriot英 [kəmˈpætriət] 美 [kəmˈpeɪtriət] n. 同胞；同国人 adj. 同胞的；同国人的==

Cohn, of course, was much younger. But he had that look of eager, deserving expectation.

Brett was damned good-looking.

She wore a slipover jersey sweater and a tweed skirt, and her hair was brushed back like a boy's.

She started all that. She was built with curves like the hull of a racing yacht, and you missed none of it with that wool jersey.

>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①a slipover jersey sweater “一件针织套衫”；slipover是“套衫”的意思，slip over作动词短语是“漫不经心，套”的意思，所以slipover就是因为这种衣服的穿着方式很简单而得名，也可以称作是pullover; jersey和sweater都是“针织衫”的意思，主要指套头无扣的那种；
>
> ②a tweed skirt “一条苏格兰粗呢裙子”，我们在盖茨比里也提到了苏格兰特色的裙子，但那个是花呢的，叫作plaid skirt.
>
> ③the hull of a racing yacht “赛艇的船身”；hull指“船体，船身”，比如steel-hulled表示“船体是钢质的”；此外hull还可以指“种子，谷物等的外壳”（husk）.
>
> ④miss none of it “一点都不会错过”，it在这里指Brett的body curves.
>
> *这一段在语言上其实别具心裁，比如she在句首的反复使用，这在一般情况下是不符合英语的简洁和流畅规则的。但在这里的效果是强调Brett深深勾住了Jake的视线，一反他在之前情节中的颓废无聊，暗示了Brett对他的特殊性。

"It's a fine crowd you're with, Brett,"?I said.

"Aren't they lovely? And you, my dear. Where did you get it?"

"At the Napolitain." "And have you had a lovely evening?"

"Oh, priceless," I said.

Brett laughed. "It's wrong of you, Jake. It's an insult to all of us. Look at Frances there, and Jo."

This for Cohn's benefit.

"It's in restraint of trade," Brett said. She laughed again.

"You're wonderfully sober," I said.

"Yes. Aren't I? And when one's with the crowd I'm with, one can drink in such safety, too."

The music started and Robert Cohn said: "Will you dance this with me, Lady Brett?"

Brett smiled at him. "I've promised to dance this with Jacob," she laughed.

"You've a hell of a biblical name, Jake."

"How about the next?" asked Cohn.

"We're going," Brett said. "We've a date up at Montmartre (蒙马特，巴黎北区). "

Dancing, I looked over Brett's shoulder and saw Cohn, standing at the bar, still watching her.

"You've made a new one there," I said to her.

"Don't talk about it. Poor chap. I never knew it till just now."

"Oh, well," I said. "I suppose you like to add them up."

"Don't talk like a fool." "You do."

"Oh, well. What if I do?"

"Nothing," I said. We were dancing to the accordion and some one was playing the banjo.

It was hot and I felt happy. We passed close to Georgette dancing with another one of them.

"What possessed you to bring her?"

> ==possess==
>
> vt. 拥有;掌握，懂得;主宰;缠住，迷住
>
> 原文："What possessed you to bring her?"
>
> “什么东西迷住了你，让你把她带来的？”
>
> 💧possess在这里是双关：首先是指“占据某人的头脑，迷住”（to occupy fully the mind of）, 比如：
>
> The dancers were possessed by the music.
>
> 舞者们完全沉浸在音乐里了。
>
> 💧其次是指“驱使某人做”（to force sb to do）, 一般是问话者对于对方做的一件蠢事表示无法理解，比如：
>
> What on earth possessed her to do it?
>
> 到底是什么让她干出这种事的？

"I don't know, I just brought her." "You're getting damned romantic."

"No, bored."

"Now?" "No, not now."

"Let's get out of here. She's well taken care of."

"Do you want to?"

"Would I ask you if I didn't want to?"

We left the floor and I took my coat off a hanger on the wall and put it on.

Brett stood by the bar. Cohn was talking to her.

I stopped at the bar and asked them for an envelope.

The patronne (酒吧老板娘) found one.

I took a fifty-franc note from my pocket, put it in the envelope, sealed it, and handed it to the patronne.

"If the girl I came with asks for me, will you give her this?" I said. "If she goes out with one of those gentlemen, will you save this for me?"

"C'est entendu, Monsieur (一言为定，先生)," the patronne said. "You go now? So early?"

"Yes," I said. We started out the door.

Cohn was still talking to Brett. She said good night and took my arm.

"Good night, Cohn," I said.

Outside in the street we looked for a taxi.

"You're going to lose your fifty francs," Brett said.

"Oh, yes." "No taxis."

"We could walk up to the Pantheon and get one."

"Come on and we'll get a drink in the pub next door and send for one."

"You wouldn't walk across the street." "Not if I could help it."

We went into the next bar and I sent a waiter for a taxi.

"Well," I said, "we're out away from them."

We stood against the tall zinc bar and did not talk and looked at each other.

The waiter came and said the taxi was outside.

Brett pressed my hand hard. I gave the waiter a franc and we went out.

"Where should I tell him?" I asked. "Oh, tell him to drive around."

I told the driver to go to the Parc Montsouris (蒙苏里公园), and got in,and slammed the door.

Brett was leaning back in the corner, her eyes closed

I sat beside her. The cab started with a jerk.

"Oh, darling, I've been so miserable," Brett said.

### 背景知识

**💧1. Panthéon 先贤祠**

Five nights a week the working people of the Pantheon quarter danced there.（每周有五个晚上，先贤祠区的劳动人民们都在这里跳舞。）

这里提到的Panthéon（先贤祠）其实就在我们介绍过的巴黎左岸的拉丁区（Latin Quarter）. Panthéon是法语，但最早来自希腊语，含义是“所有的神”（pan表示“所有的，泛的”，theo表示“神”）. 这类的建筑，通常以供奉诸神而著称。例如公元前五世纪古希腊人修筑的雅典巴特农神庙（Parthenon）, 便是供奉着这世上所有的神灵。类似的建筑，意大利也有一所，也即我们所熟知的“万神殿”（也叫Pantheon）.

先贤祠原是路易十五时代建成的一座教堂，供奉着巴黎的守护女神——“圣热纳维耶芙” （Sainte Geneviève）的圣物，1791年被收归国有脱离宗教后，改为埋葬“伟人”的墓地；1814年到1830年间，它又归还教会；现在是永久纪念法国历史名人的圣殿。

先贤祠中的艺术装饰非常美观，其穹顶（dome）上的大型壁画是名画家安托万·格罗特创作的。1830年“七月革命”之后，绘画的主题改变，先贤祠具有了“纯粹的爱国与民族”特性。

先贤祠内安葬着伏尔泰（Voltaire）、卢梭（Rousseau）、维克多·雨果（Victor Hugo）、爱弥尔·左拉（ Émile Zola）、居里夫人（Marie Curie）和大仲马（Alexandre Dumas）等。



**💧2. Bal Musette 手风琴舞会**



The dancing-club was a *bal* *musette* in the Rue de la Montagne Sainte Genevieve.（这家跳舞俱乐部里跳的都是手风琴舞，位置就在圣杰尼维耶弗山路上。）

Jake一伙人吃完晚饭后的消遣是去一家俱乐部里跳手风琴舞。这里的*bal musette*是在1880s风靡于巴黎的一种音乐和舞蹈形式，特点就是以手风琴（accordion）为主角。

这种风格并不是巴黎本地的产物，而是来自法国中部的奥弗涅大区（Auvergne）的地方舞蹈和民乐。当时很多奥弗涅人（Auvergnats）居住在法国的第5、11、12区（arrondissement）, 第5区也就是我们上面提到的先贤祠区，这一片都属于拉丁区的范围。他们在自己的居住区内开了很多的酒吧，里面跳的就是他们民间的bourrée舞——节奏轻快，还有手风琴伴奏。

手风琴舞大受欢迎的原因是简单易学、移动敏捷，而且舞步性感，也不需要太大的场地，在小酒吧里空间正合适。

这些地方虽然主要是穷人的活动场地，但也经常有法国的上层名流来到这里找乐子。而且店主们有时候会为了这些“大老板”的利益，故意制造警察突袭的恐慌（some establishments even staged mock police raids for their patrons' benefit）, 好让其他人都被吓跑。

到1945年，手风琴舞已经走到了法国时髦的最前沿，还掀起了一股对于手风琴舞者的追星潮。但是到了1960年，它的热度就开始急剧褪减（declined drastically）. 今天手风琴舞在融入现代元素后，也展露出了复兴的劲头（a revival has begun）.

### 课文理解

Jake和Georgette跟着大伙一起到了手风琴舞会上。但Jake显然提不起兴致，里面又小又热，所以他也不跳舞，就站在门口的过道上吹外面的凉风（I drank a beer, standing in the doorway and getting the cool breath of wind from the street）.

直到门口停下了两辆出租车，走出来的是一个叫Brett的女人，还有她的“男伴们”。Jake看到他们的妆容打扮莫名怒火中烧（I was very angry.）而且他还强调了一句一直以来都是如此（Somehow they always made me angry）. 这里其实暗藏了一条线索，Jake是个恐同者。我们可以从他对这群男伴的描述中看出来——



💧**Clue 1**:  Jake is homophobia.



**Evidence 1**: As they went in, under the light I saw white hands, wavy hair, white faces, grimacing, gesturing, talking.

当他们挤眉弄眼、比比划划、七嘴八舌地往里走的时候，在灯光下我看清他们的白手、卷发和白脸。

Jake在这里强调white是带着鄙夷的，比如他们可能只是在脸上擦脂抹粉了，但在Jake看来就是全身能露的出来的地方都是白花花的。以及三个词grimacing, gesturing, talking的连用也表明了他的厌恶：在语言层面上，-ing形式本身就有表示某件事持续进行而让人很厌烦的意思。



**Evidence 2**: When I came back to the Bal there was a crowd on the floor and Georgette was dancing with the tall blond youth, who danced big-hippily, carrying his head on one side, his eyes lifted as he danced.

当我回到舞厅的时候，舞池里挤满了人，乔杰特正和那个高个子的金发小伙在跳舞。他跳舞的时候，使劲扭动臀部，歪着脑袋，眼睛朝上斜吊着。



big-hippily是一个很冒犯人的词，hippy（也可以拼作hippie）指“臀部大的”，而且主要是用来形容女性。这里是Jake很不满这个金发小伙跳舞的时候拼命扭捏身姿。



大家可能疑惑的另一个点是，为什么Jake看到Brett和这些男伴在一起也会如此不舒服呢？比如他颇具挖苦地说了一句she was very much with them（她和他们打成一片），以及在Brett首次出现的时候，Jake形容她的口吻就像是俩人已经认识一样（with hem was Brett）. 这里作者再次向我们隐瞒了一个线索，也就是Jake和Brett其实是一对旧情人。我们可以在他们虽然看似平淡但实则暗流涌动的对话里找到佐证——



💧**Clue 2**:  Jake and Brett used to be intimate.



**Evidence 1**: Dancing, I looked over Brett's shoulder and saw Cohn, standing at the bar, still watching her.

"You've made a new one there," I said to her.

"Don't talk about it. Poor chap. I never knew it till just now."

"Oh, well," I said. "I suppose you like to add them up."

跳舞的时候，我从勃莱特的肩膀上望过去，只见科恩在酒吧柜边站着，仍然盯着她看。

“你又迷住了一个人，”我对她说。

“别谈这个。可怜的家伙，我也是刚刚才发觉。”

“哦，好嘛，”我说。“依我看你是多多益善吧。”



虽然Jake很想装出若无其事的口吻，但这股打翻了醋坛子的酸味读者透着纸就能嗅到了。以及一直到离开俱乐部之前，他的视线都没离开过Cohn和Brett, 比如他一直在反复强调，Brett要么拿着酒杯要么站在吧台边上，而这时候Cohn都在看着她：



She stood holding the glass and I saw Robert Cohn looking at her.

Brett stood by the bar. Cohn was talking to her.



说明Jake心里极为介意Cohn对Brett也产生了好感，当然不可避免地我们的故事从此就要拉开一个感情三角了。



**Evidence 2**: "Oh, darling, I've been so miserable," Brett said.

“哦，亲爱的，我是多么不幸啊，”勃莱特说。



这句话作为章节的结尾也颇有深意。在俱乐部的时候，Brett展现出的都是轻松愉快的样子。直到她和Jake一起坐上出租车远离了人群之后，Brett才开始表露自己的心迹。比如她一言不发地紧握住了Jake的手（Brett pressed my hand hard）, 以及最后的这句话，她突然说自己过得其实很糟糕。



至此前三章其实就是作者为后面作的铺陈，接着冰山下面的部分也会渐渐显露出来。这里面有主角们沉重的过去，以及解释了他们如何变成了今天的样子。我们一起期待吧~

### 今日彩蛋

**💧圣经故事：上帝的应许之地**



He looked a great deal as his compatriot must have looked when he saw the promised land.（他目不转睛地看着，活像他那位同胞看到上帝赐给他的土地时的神情。）



大家可能会好奇他的同胞（his compatriot）是指谁呢？我们知道Cohn是犹太人，所以这里的同胞其实是指他的犹太祖先亚伯拉罕。关于上帝给亚伯拉罕看他的所赐之地的故事出现在《圣经》的创世纪第十二章里。

亚伯拉罕是诺亚（就是那位造方舟的诺亚）的儿子闪的后裔。因为诺亚的儿子闪是蒙上帝祝福的，所以亚伯拉罕也尤其得到上帝的眷顾与指引。

创世纪十二章的开篇就是上帝对亚伯拉罕（原名是亚伯兰）的呼召：

“耶和华对亚伯兰说：‘你要离开本地、本族、父家，往我所要指示你的地去。我必叫你成为大国。我必赐福给你，叫你的名为大，你也要叫别人得福。为你祝福的，我必赐福与他；那诅咒你的，我必诅咒他。地上的万族都要因你得福。”

所以亚伯拉罕便离开迦勒底的吾珥，自己带着妻子，侄子离开部族出哈兰前往上帝应许的迦南地。这一过程中，亚伯兰一到迦南就经历了饥荒，不得不往南下到埃及；经过法老夺妻，与侄子罗得的纷争，最终分道扬镳；后又经历一连串的部落战争，逐渐发展壮大起来，最后成为迦南地区强大的部族；并且上帝和他再次立约，不仅仅带他出哈兰，进入迦南，明确地将迦南地赐给他及他的后裔为业，到这里亚伯兰才自此被称为亚伯拉罕，意思是多国的父。

但是亚伯拉罕在进入迦南地之前就死了，所以到达上帝应许之地的担子就落在他的后裔之上，由此也延伸出了《圣经》的旧约第二卷——“出埃及记”。

*迦南美地（Canaan），按照《圣经》所说，是“流奶与蜜之地”，在实际中指的是由巴勒斯坦或其位于约旦河和地中海之间的部分组成的一个古代地区。一般指西起地中海沿岸平原，东至约旦河谷，南至内格夫，北至加利利地区的一片区域。 包括今日的巴勒斯坦、约旦及埃及北部的一部分。

The taxi went up the hill, passed the lighted square, then on into the dark, still climbing, then levelled out onto a dark street behind St. Etienne du Mont (圣埃蒂安教堂),

went smoothly down the asphalt (柏油路), passed the trees and the standing bus at the Place de la Contrescarpe (康特斯卡普广场), then turned onto the cobbles of the Rue Mouffetard (穆浮塔街).

I saw her face in the lights from the open shops, then it was dark, then I saw her face clearly as we came out on the Avenue des Gobelins (戈贝林斯大道).

The street was torn up and men were working on the car-tracks by the light of acetylene (电石灯) flares.

Brett's face was white and the long line of her neck showed in the bright light of the flares.

The street was dark again and I kissed her.

Our lips were tight together and then she turned away and pressed against the corner of the seat, as far away as she could get.

Her head was down."Don't touch me," she said."Please don't touch me."

"What's the matter?""I can't stand it.""Oh, Brett."

"You mustn't. You must know. I can't stand it, that's all. Oh, darling, please understand!"

"Don't you love me?"

"Love you? I simply turn all to jelly when you touch me."

> turn to jelly 直译是“变得像果冻一样软塌塌的”，引申为“（腿或膝盖）因为害怕紧张而发软打颤”；turn to可以用feel like或be来替换，jelly也可以换成leaf, 比如：Before I went into the exam room I was shaking like a leaf.（在走进考场之前，我紧张得浑身发抖。）
>
> *再为大家补充一个包含jelly的俚语表达：like nailing jelly to the wall. “就像是要把果冻粘在墙上一样”，也就是“不可能完成的，徒劳无功的”（incredibly difficult）, 比如：Trying to have a reasonable debate with her father is like nailing jelly to the wall.（想要和她父亲讲道理是完全不可能的。）

"Isn't there anything we can do about it?"

She was sitting up now.

My arm was around her and she was leaning back against me, and we were quite calm.

She was looking into my eyes with that way she had of looking that made you wonder whether she really saw out of her own eyes.

> <font color=red>She was looking into my eyes / with that way she had of looking / that made you wonder / whether she really saw out of her own eyes.</font>

> that way she had of looking 是一个定语从句，改写后就是：she had that way of looking. have a/the way of being/doing表示“习惯性地做；做事有什么特征”（to often have a characteristic or to frequently do something）, 比如：She has a way of exaggerating when she tells stories.（她讲故事的时候总有办法说得很夸张。）

They would look on and on after every one else's eyes in the world would have stopped looking.

"And there's not a damn thing we could do," I said.

"I don't know," she said. "I don't want to go through that hell again."

"We'd better keep away from each other."

"But, darling, I have to see you. It isn't all that you know."

"No, but it always gets to be."

"That's my fault. Don't we pay for all the things we do, though?"

She had been looking into my eyes all the time.

Her eyes had different depths, sometimes they seemed perfectly flat.

Now you could see all the way into them.

"When I think of the hell I've put chaps through. I'm paying for it all now."

> chap指“家伙，小伙子”，从chapman“流动商贩”沿用而来，一般是英国人会用，而且通常是在书面语中。我们比较熟悉的男性称呼中，guy最为常用，普通关系也可以使用；fellow则有鄙夷的意思，“这大兄弟，这家伙”；buddy是关系比较好的朋友才会这么称呼；bad bod就稍微有点暧昧了，有点嗔怪的感觉，像是说“捣蛋鬼”。

"Don't talk like a fool," I said. "Besides, what happened to me is supposed to be funny. I never think about it."

"Oh, no. I'll lay you don't."

"Well, let's shut up about it."

"I laughed about it too, myself, once." She wasn't looking at me.

"A friend of my brother's came home that way from Mons (蒙斯，比利时西南部的一座古城). It seemed like a hell of a joke. Chaps never know anything, do they?"

"No," I said. "Nobody ever knows anything."

I was pretty well through with the subject.

At one time or another I had probably considered it from most of its various angles,

including the one that certain injuries or imperfections are a subject of merriment while remaining quite serious for the person possessing them.

"It's funny," I said. "It's very funny. And it's a lot of fun, too, to be in love."

"Do you think so?" her eyes looked flat again.

"I don't mean fun that way. In a way it's an enjoyable feeling."

"No," she said. "I think it's hell on earth."

"It's good to see each other."

"No. I don't think it is."

"Don't you want to?""I have to."

We were sitting now like two strangers. On the right was the Parc Montsouris (蒙特苏里公园).

The restaurant where they have the pool of live trout and where you cansit and look out over the park was closed and dark.

The driver leaned his head around.

"Where do you want to go?" I asked. Brett turned her head away.

"Oh, go to the Select."

"Cafe? Select," I told the driver. "Boulevard Montparnasse (蒙帕纳斯大街)."

We drove straight down, turning around the Lion de Belfort (贝尔福狮像) that guards the passing Montrouge (蒙鲁日, 法国南部城市) trams.

> ==tram英 [træm] 美 [træm] n. 有轨电车轨道；煤车，矿车，缆车==

Brett looked straight ahead. On the Boulevard Raspail, with the lights of Montparnasse in sight, Brett said: "Would you mind very much if I asked you to do something?"

"Don't be silly."<br>"Kiss me just once more before we get there."

When the taxi stopped I got out and paid. Brett came out putting on her hat.

She gave me her hand as she stepped down. Her hand was shaky.

> ==shaky英 [ˈʃeɪki] 美 [ˈʃeɪki] adj.（地位，信用等）动摇的；（因病、体弱等）摇晃的；虚弱的；不可靠的==

"I say, do I look too much of a mess?"

She pulled her man's felt hat down and started in for the bar.

Inside, against the bar and at tables, were most of the crowd who had been at the dance.

"Hello, you chaps," Brett said. "I'm going to have a drink."

"Oh, Brett! Brett!" the little Greek portrait-painter, who called himself a duke, and whom everybody called Zizi, pushed up to her.

"I got something fine to tell you.""Hello, Zizi," Brett said.

"I want you to meet a friend," Zizi said. A fat man came up.

"Count Mippipopolous, meet my friend Lady Ashley."

"How do you do?" said Brett.

"Well, does your Ladyship have a good time here in Paris?" asked Count Mippipopolous (), who wore an elk's tooth on his watch chain.

"Rather," said Brett."Paris is a fine town all right," said the count.

"But I guess you have pretty big doings yourself over in London."

"Oh, yes," said Brett. "Enormous."

"No," I said. "I must shove off. Seen Cohn?"

"He went home with Frances," Mrs. Braddock put in.

"Poor chap, he looks awfully down," Braddocks said.

"I dare say he is," said Mrs. Braddocks.

"I have to shove off," I said. "Good night."

I said good night to Brett at the bar.The count was buying champagne.

"Will you take a glass of wine with us, sir?" he asked.

"No. Thanks awfully. I have to go."

"Really going?" Brett asked.

"Yes," I said. "I've got a rotten headache."

"I'll see you to-morrow?"

"Come in at the office.""Hardly."

"Well, where will I see you?""Anywhere around five o'clock.”

"Make it the other side of town then." "Good. I'll be at the Crillon (即Hotel de Crillon, 克里龙酒店) at five."

"Try and be there," I said.

"Don't worry," Brett said. "I've never let you down, have I?"

"Heard from Mike?" "Letter to-day."

"Good night, sir," said the count.

I went out onto the sidewalk and walked down toward the Boulevard St. Michel (米歇尔大街), passed the tables of the Rotonde (园亭咖啡馆), still crowded

looked across the Street at the Dome, its tables running out to the edge of the pavement.

Some one waved at me from a table, I did not see who it was and went on.

### 背景知识

**💧1. Lion de Belfort 贝尔福狮像**

We drove straight down, turning around the Lion de Belfort that guards the passing Montrouge trams.（我们径直开下去，绕过守卫着开往蒙鲁日的电车的贝尔福狮像。）

这里坐落在巴黎丹费尔-罗什洛广场（Place Denfert-Rochereau）的贝尔福狮像并不是“真身”，它其实是一个缩小版（a reduction of the original one）, 原像落在贝尔福镇（the town of Belfort）.

那么为什么这里会放置贝尔福狮像呢？因为这个广场的名字其实就是为了纪念普法战争中一位功勋卓著的将军Pierre Denfert-Rochereau, 当时他带领军队在贝尔福镇守防御。

（丹费尔-罗什洛广场上的贝尔福狮像）

坐落在贝尔福镇的这座狮像是由雕塑家Frédéric Bartholdi设计的，他的雕像作品还有举世闻名的自由女神像（the Statue of Liberty）.

整个雕塑完成于1880年，而且全部都是由红砂岩（red sandstone）制成的。我们刚刚提到在巴黎的那一尊是缩小版，那么原版有多呢？大概是22米长，11米高，可谓是傲然俯视整个小镇了。

贝尔福狮像代表着法兰西人民在“贝尔福之围”（the Siege of Belfort）中长达103天的对普鲁士袭击的英勇抵抗（the heroic French resistance against the Prussian assault）. 

当时整个贝尔福镇只有1万7千个人（军队仅有3500人），而普鲁士军队则有4万人，因此突围的胜利也成为一段辉煌的历史。这座雕塑便用来纪念人民的坚强意志和对自由的热爱。

**💧2. Hôtel de Crillon 克利翁酒店**

"Make it the other side of town then." "Good. I'll be at the Crillon at five." "Try and be there," I said. "Don't worry," Brett said. "I've never let you down, have I?" （“那就在对岸找个地方吧。” “好的。五点钟我在克里龙。” “一言为定，可别失约。” 我说。“放心吧，”勃莱特说，“我什么时候哄过你？”）

Brett和Jake约在了克里翁酒店见面。这座酒店就坐落在巴黎市中心的协和广场（Place de la Concorde）上，对面是美国大使馆。它在巴黎人心目中是最“巴黎”最古老最具历史文化底蕴的豪华酒店，历来是世界各国元首和各界要人首选下榻之地。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/4d9d78960d459688487d0585ab9fba5c-sz_430466.png)



这里还有个小插曲，很多人可能不知道其实在克利翁酒店的旁边，也就是协和广场店的东侧，还有另一座和它完全一模一样（completely identical）的酒店，就叫“海军酒店”（Hôtel de la Marine）. 

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/3cde71eb1d473e1dbe78adc9addf5a59-sz_174555.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)

（左侧是克利翁酒店，右侧是海军酒店）



克利翁酒店建于1758年，当时的路易十五世命令建筑师在协和广场的这个位置上建两座新古典主义风格（neoclassical）的宫殿。“海军酒店”直到2015年后一直都是法国海军的总部所在（the headquarters of the French Navy）. 

而克利翁酒店起先是租予奥蒙特公爵（Duke d’Aumont），一位著名的艺术赞助家（a famous patron of the arts）, 后来才转由克利翁家族（the Crillon family）持有所有权，直至1907年。

早在1778年，这座酒店就已经在历史舞台上占据一席之地，比如当时法国与美国缔结法美同盟条约及通商友好条约并承认美国独立就是在此；进入20世纪，促成“国际联盟”于1919年成立的所有会议都在这间酒店召开；一战期间，酒店曾被召为盟军总部；二战期间，这里是法国军队和英国军队指挥官的住所。1944 年法国解放后，酒店变成美国军事指挥官和驻巴黎外交官的使馆。

时至今日，克利翁酒店仍遗留有过去华丽时光的痕迹，比如Salon des Aigles天花板上的Wedgewood圆形陶瓷浮雕；Les Ambassadeurs餐厅的水晶吊灯与大理石地板。

克利翁酒店最广为人知的是便是每年举办的巴黎名媛成年舞会le Bal. 这个源于英国贵族社会的传统：年满十八岁的贵族少女会在指定的一天，穿上她们最漂亮的衣服，拜见女王，表示这一年中社交季节的正式开始。这些少女被称为debutantes, 也就是“初次踏入社交界的人”。

1957年，著名的高级时装品牌Jean Patou复兴了这个传统，1968年的政治动荡又终结了它，1991年恢复，并选择克利翁酒店为举办地。

### 课文理解

在出租车上，Jake和Brett沉默了很久，这里体现在开篇的一长段都在描写出租车如何在街区之间穿梭，一会在爬坡（still climbing）, 一会又开到了平路上（levelled out onto a dark street）, 沿途都是灯火通明的酒吧和通宵营业的商店。

这里也可以看作是两位主人公内心活动的写照。在Brett突然说出（Chapter 3的结尾）自己其实过得很糟糕之后，对话并没有就此展开，此刻二人心里应该都在翻江倒海。最后是Jake抓住车内光线变暗的时机，突然吻了Brett. 但Brett在反应过来后又退缩到了车座一角，并且反应很激烈（"Don't touch me," she said. "Please don't touch me."）

在Jake的追问下，Brett才说明不是因为自己不爱她，而是其他的原因（这里作者并没有完全点明，而是留待我们在之后的情节里慢慢发掘）。这里的矛盾是这本小说最令人揪心的一点，也是Jake和Brett都无法解决的困境——

💧**Clue 1**:  Jake wants Brett Ashley, but he can't "have" her.



**Evidence 1**: "Isn't there anything we can do about it?"... "And there's not a damn thing we could do," I said.

“对此咱们就一点办法都没有？”……“咱们真他妈的一点办法都没有。”

这两句话出自Jake之口。对他来说最纠结的地方在于，Brett并不是对他丧失热情了，他也依然迫切地想拥有她，可尽管两人的意志都如此强烈，事实上的障碍却是他们都无法跨越的。这里需要联想在故事开篇的时候，Jake很隐晦地说自己生了病（"I'm sick"）, 并且表示自己是在战争中受的伤。

随后两人开始讨论面对不幸的态度，Brett认为自己现在遭受的种种痛苦都是对过去恶行的补偿——



💧**Clue 2**: Brett tends to think that the suffering of misfortunes are the payment for bad behavior.



**Evidence 1**: "That's my fault. Don't we pay for all the things we do, though?"

“这是我的过错。不过，难道我们不在为我们这一切行为付出代价？”



**Evidence 2**: "When I think of the hell I've put chaps through. I'm paying for it all now."

“我想到我给很多人带来痛苦。我现在正在还这笔账呢。”

Brett认为现在的处境，都是由她自己以前的恶行带来的（从她说自己给很多人带来痛苦来看，可能是指生活上的不检点或者玩弄他人感情）。所以她和Jake要忍受虽然彼此相爱，但却无法在一起的痛苦。

但Jake似乎并不赞成她的这种观点：



**Evidence 3**: "Don't talk like a fool," I said. "Besides, what happened to me is supposed to be funny. I never think about it."

“别说傻话了，”我说。“而且，对我自己的遭遇，我总是一笑置之。我从来不去想它。”

但Jake并非真的完全能够轻松面对，比如后面他自我安慰或麻痹式的陈述：At one time or another I had probably considered it……（难点分析7对这个句子作了详细解释）；此外，正是Jake的困惑或痛苦构成了这个故事的悬念——因为无论让Brett还是Jake饱受折磨的都是，他们无法消解现实的困境。这也是本书最重要的主题之一：人的痛苦和不幸遭遇是否都是罪有应得？如果不是，那么公平该怎么定义？作为渺小的个体又要如何找到解决和面对的路径？

### 今日彩蛋

**💧英国的贵族称谓都有哪些？**

大家有没有发现除了Jake, 其他人对Brett的称呼都是Lady Brett呢？比如Cohn在邀请Brett跳舞的时候：The music started and Robert Cohn said: "Will you dance this with me, Lady Brett?"；以及Brett的一位朋友在介绍她的时候说道："Count Mippipopolous, meet my friend Lady Ashley."（Brett的全名是Brett Asheley）.

Lady在这里不只是普通表示尊敬的称谓这么简单，它代表的其实是英国的爵位头衔。以及Brett的朋友为她引荐的这个法国人，名字前面有一个Count, 这就是法国的伯爵爵位的名称（对应的英国的伯爵爵位是Earl）. 英国和法国的贵族分级和称呼稍有不同，今天的彩蛋我们就先来看一看英国是怎么划分贵族以及他们各自的称谓吧~

\1. 公爵 Duke / Duchess

英国历史上的第一个公爵是在公元1337年出现的。“公爵”是一个极其重要、极有分量的头衔，每个时代获得公爵爵位的人都屈指可数。这里的duchess，一般是指拥有自己的公爵领地或爵位的女性，或者是duke的妻子。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/75fd2b9cf73223cc259b4852510ec5ab-sz_24331.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)

（Duke of Wellington 威灵顿公爵）

普通人在面对duke/duchess时，要称他们为Your Grace；公爵跟公爵见面的时候，也就是地位一致的时候呢，就用duke/duchess来称呼（英语当中我们用address这个词表示称呼，address作动词，后面跟某个人，意思是“称呼某人，冠以某种称呼”：is properly addressed as…）

说某某公爵的时候，都要加of，比如the Duke of Norfolk（of后面接领地）。

\2. 侯爵 Marquess或Marquis / Marchioness

侯爵是社会地位仅次于公爵的贵族人群。Marquess这个单词是从法语过来的，原词与borders，具体说是英格兰、苏格兰、威尔士的边界有关。不列颠诸岛最早的侯爵是1385年出现的。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/1c24fbbac8587e7e36c7ce2a06a33398-sz_16196.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)

（Marquis de Sade 萨德侯爵）

普通人在面对侯爵的时候呢，要称呼他们为Lord/Lady（其实，在贵族当中，只有在面对公爵的时候要说Your Grace，其他的世袭贵族成为Lord），Lord/Lady后面接姓氏。在说某某侯爵的时候，基本上所有情况下都要加of，比如the Marquess of Bath（有例外：Marques Camden等，且of后面通常跟领地）。

*在英国，lord这个词还用于某些高级官员的职位前（阁下、大人、大臣），或者是称呼法官、主教等等以示尊重。

\3. 伯爵 Earl / Countess

Earl这个词是公侯伯子男五种爵位中唯一一个来源于古英语的词汇。同时，不像其他四个爵位的单词，表示男性的词语有专门的对等的女性版本，earl这个词在古英语里并没有对等的女性版本，所以用了countess这个词。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/3ca81c45ad7e43dd2493085f4fefb4d8-sz_418938.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)

（Earl Grey 格雷伯爵）

最初时伯爵多是一人管辖数郡的诸侯，在诺曼大公侵入英国后，担心其权势过重而将伯爵的封地改为一郡。这些伯爵在地方上负有对男爵、骑士的直接领导权。

在重大正式场合，伯爵穿着镶有白色毛皮边的红色丝绒外套，软帽上缝镶着三条貂皮，冠冕上有一镀金银圈，上沿饰有8个银球。

\4. 子爵 Viscount / Viscountess

这一称号源于法国，原意类似于我们说的“郡守”，子爵处于世袭贵族的第四级，最早是伯爵的副手，不过在历史上，子爵有时也会是权倾一方的诸侯。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/9f2412535fe50f3c29699318749abe3c-sz_1739274.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmhigh)

（Viscount Nelson 纳尔逊子爵）

跟前面公侯伯三种爵位不同的是，在说某某子爵的时候，Viscount这个词后面是不加of的，直接加姓氏或者封地。

另外还要注意的一点是，一个人可以同时被授予多个爵位，伯爵、侯爵、公爵同时也可能是男爵或者子爵，而他们也许会把自己较低的爵位转赠给长子和继承人意思意思。甚至公爵还有可能同时是伯爵，比如说，里士满公爵（The Duke of Richmond）的继承人就受赠头衔马奇伯爵（Earl of March）.

\5. 男爵 Baron / Baroness

Baron这个词源自古日耳曼语。在说某某男爵的时候也不需要加of，这里的规则跟前面子爵的差不多，只有在同时说姓氏和领地的时候，才说Baron某某of某地（Baron Trevor of Bromham）.

（Baron Cavendish of Hardwicke 哈德威克的卡文迪许男爵）

男爵是五等贵族阶级里的最后一等。英国的男爵出现于11世纪，到12世纪初国王把大部分的世俗贵族都被封为男爵。其中少数与王室关系密、封地较多者又被称做“大男爵”，其地位在伯爵和男爵之间。后来，大男爵中的显赫者升为伯爵，其余也就慢慢变为普通男爵。

正因当时男爵在世俗贵族中占了很高比例，以至于“男爵”一词长期作为贵族的集合名词使用。1387年至今，男爵的人数始终是最多的。

\6. 其他爵位

其实在公侯伯子男后面，还有两种爵位：Baronet（准男爵）和Knight（骑士），但都不属于peerage，就是说不是贵族。准男爵Baronet是英国最低的世袭爵位。至于Knight，拥有这个头衔的人，一般是用Sir来称呼的。

以上提到的都属于世袭爵位，而与世袭贵族相对的就是终身贵族，不存在继承一说。不过他们的孩子表面上还是能够像世袭贵族家的小孩那样的，可以用the Honourable这种称谓，但实际上并不能继承爵位。

历史上，英国退休的首相都会获封爵位，传统上是伯爵爵位，然后进上议院。当然也有一些首相是在当上首相之前就有爵位的，那么等退休的时候可能爵位会晋升。但是，丘吉尔很不一样。当时他获封Dukedom of Dover（多佛公爵），但他没有接受。著名的Iron Lady撒切尔夫人则是获封男爵（life peerage，终身爵位）。

There was a light in the concierge's room and I knocked on the door and she gave me my mail.

> ==concierge英 [ˈkɒnsieəʒ] 美 [kɔ:nˈsjerz] n. 看门人，门房==

I wished her good night and went up-stairs. There were two letters and some papers.

I looked at them under the gas-light in the dining-room.

The letters were from the States.

One was a bank statement. It showed a balance of $2432.60.

I got out my check-book and deducted four checks drawn since the first of the month, and discovered I had a balance of $1832.60.

> ==deduct英 [dɪˈdʌkt] 美 [dɪˈdʌkt] vt. 演绎；扣除，减去==

I wrote this on the back of the statement.

The other letter was a wedding announcement.

Mr. and Mrs. Aloysius Kirby announce the marriage of their daughter Katherine--I knew neither the girl nor the man she was marrying.

They must be circularizing the town.It was a funny name.

> ==circularize==
>
> vt. 通知；传阅；分发传单
>
> 原文：They must be circularizing the town.
>
> 他们想必是整个镇都发了结婚请柬。
>
> 💧circular作为形容词表示“流通的”，所以circularize就是“使流通，传阅”，相当于send around. 比如：He is circularizing (sending around) an appeal for funds.
>
> 他正在四处进行募资。

I felt Sure I could remember anybody with a name like Aloysius.

It was a good Catholic name. There was a crest on the announcement.

Like Zizi the Greek duke. And that count.

The count was funny. Brett had a title, too.

Lady Ashley. To hell with Brett. To hell with you, Lady Ashley.

I lit the lamp beside the bed, turned off the gas, and opened the wide windows.

The bed was far back from the windows, and I sat with the windows open and undressed by the bed.

Outside a night train, running on the street-car tracks, went by carrying vegetables to the markets.

They were noisy at night when you could not sleep.

Undressing, I looked at myself in the mirror of the big armoire beside the bed.

That was a typically French way to furnish a room.

Practical, too, I suppose. Of all the ways to be wounded.

I suppose it was funny. I put on my pajamas and got into bed.

I had the two bull-fight papers, and I took their wrappers off.

One was orange. The other yellow.

They would both have the same news, so whichever I read first would spoil the other.

Le Toril was the better paper, so I started to read it. I read it all the way through, including the Petite Correspondance and the Cornigrams.

> <font color=red>I read it all the way through, including thePetite Correspondance and the Cornigrams.</font>
>
> 我从头到尾看了一遍，包括读者小信箱栏和斗牛节目单。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①all the way through 表示“从头到尾”，through本身有“从一端到另一端”的意思，这里就是from the first page to the last page. through还可以搭配时间，比如：He slept right through the day.（他睡了一整天。）
>
> ②Petite Correspondance “读者小信箱栏”；petite原义是形容“（女子）娇小可爱的”，这里可以理解为“短小的”（short）; correspondance也就是“信函”，或者指“通信联系”，比如be in correspondance with sb表示“和某人保持通信”。
>
> ③Cornigrams 是一个捏造的词，可以猜测是关于斗牛比赛的节目单（-gram这个后缀表示“清单、列表”）。

I blew out the lamp. Perhaps I would be able to sleep.

My head started to work. The old grievance.

>
> 原文：My head started to work. The old grievance.
>
> 我开始胡思乱想起来。想起这一块多年的心病。
>
> 💧grievance和grief都是由动词grieve延伸出来的，但意思稍有不同。grievance侧重指“（因为不平而产生的）委屈或抱怨”，比如：There must be an opportunity for both sides to air theirgrievances.
>
> 一定要有一个机会让双方都说出心中的不满。
>
> 💧而grief表示“悲痛，悲伤”，比如：The grief she felt over Helen’s death was almost unbearable. 
>
> 她因海伦的去世而悲痛难当。

Well, it was a rotten way to be wounded and flying on a joke front like the Italian.

> <font color=red>Well, it was a rotten way / to be wounded andflying / on a joke front like the Italian.</font>

>
> ②fly 表示“逃离”其实也是一种比较正式的用法，相当于flee. 比如：By the time the police arrived, the men had flown.（警察赶到时，那些人已经逃走了。）
>
> **💧知识拓展**
>
> 这里形容意大利前线为a joke front其实是有历史缘由的。作为一战中的重要参战国之一，意大利是所有列强中最不讲信用的一个。当时在战前欧洲分裂为英法俄为首的协约国和以德奥意为首的同盟国。意大利作为同盟国的一员，与德国、奥匈帝国签订了互相援助的三国同盟条约。但一战开战还没一年，意大利就投敌叛变，加入了协约国的一方，狠狠的坑了盟友一把。所以Jake才说从意大利前线上因为受伤退下来实在不是什么光荣的事情。

In the Italian hospital we were going to form a society.

It had a funny name in Italian. I wonder what became of the others, the Italians.

That was in the Ospedale Maggiore in Milano (米兰总医院), Padiglione Ponte (庞蒂病房).

The next building was the Padiglione Zonda (宗达病房). There was a statue of Ponte, or maybe it was Zonda.

That was where the liaison colonel (上校联络官) came to visit me.

> ==liaison英 [liˈeɪzn] 美 [liˈeɪzɑ:n] n. 联络，联络人==
>
> ==colonel英 [ˈkɜ:nl] 美 [ˈkɜ:rnl] n. 上校==

That was funny. That was about the first funny thing.

I was all bandaged up. But they had told him about it.

Then he made that wonderful speech: "You, a foreigner, an Englishman" (any foreigner was an Englishman) "have given more than your life."

What a speech! I would like to have it illuminated to hang in the office.

> <font color=red>What a speech! I would like to have it illuminated / to hang in the office.</font>

> ①have it illuminated 也就是to illuminate it. illuminate在这里不是常见的“照亮，阐明”的意思，而是指“镶字，镀金或镀银”（to decorate (a manuscript or book) with colors and gold or silver）.
>
> ②hang 在这里表示“挂在墙上”是用主动语态，比如：There was a family photograph hanging on the wall.（墙上挂着一幅全家福。）

He never laughed. He was putting himself in my place, I guess.

"Che mala fortuna! Che mala fortuna! ([意大利语] 真不幸、真不幸啊！)" I never used to realize it, I guess.

I try and play it along and just not make trouble for people.

> 也可以指“暂时忍受”（to put up with temporarily）, 比如：I know that school can be boring sometimes, but you just need to play along for a while until you can study things that really interest you.（我知道上学有时候确实很无聊，但在学到感兴趣的东西之前，暂且就先忍受着吧。）
>
> *这里Jake受到来看望他的上校联络官的触动（他似乎是真切地为Jake的受伤感到悲痛），所以觉得自己应该装作以平常心对待，这样避免让别人过度为他感到闹心。

Probably I never would have had any trouble if I hadn't run into Brett when they shipped me to England.

I suppose she only wanted what she couldn't have.

Well, people were that way. To hell with people.

The Catholic Church had an awfully good way of handling all that.

Good advice, anyway. Not to think about it.

Oh, it was swell advice. Try and take it sometime. Try and take it.

> <font color=red>Good advice, anyway. Not to think about it. Oh, it was swell advice. Try and take it sometime. Try and take it.</font>

> ①swell advice “忠言，金玉良言”；swell在这里表示“极好的，一流的”，是已经过时的用法，比如：You look swell!（你看上去漂亮极了！）
>
> *这里的忠言就是上一句的“Not to think about it.” 指天主教的信仰在面对人总是想得到自己得不到的东西时，采取的策略就是回避、克制自己的念头。Jake在这里是讽刺的语气，他并不认同这种观念。
>
> ②take it “忍受（痛苦）”（to endure or tolerate sth unpleasant or harsh）, 比如：Military training is grueling, and some people just can't take it.（军事训练很折磨人 ，有些人就是受不了而已。）
>
> *take it 还有一个意思是指“（在某种程度上）理解，明白”（to understand in a certain way）, 比如：I take it the gig was canceled, judging from the sound of that phone call.（从那通电话的内容来看，听起来似乎是演奏会取消了。）

I lay awake thinking and my mind jumping around.

Then I couldn't keep away from it, and I started to think about Brett and all the rest of it went away.

I was thinking about Brett and my mind stopped jumping around and started to go in sort of smooth waves.

Then all of a sudden I started to cry.

Then after a while it was better and I lay in bed and listened to the heavy trams go by and way down the street, and then I went to sleep.

I woke up. There was a row going on outside.

I listened and I thought I recognized a voice.

I put on a dressing-gown and went to the door. The concierge was talking down-stairs.

She was very angry. I heard my name and called down the stairs.

"Is that you, Monsieur Barnes?" the concierge called.

"Yes. It's me."

"There's a species of woman here who's waked the whole street up.

What kind of a dirty business at this time of night! She says she must see you. I've told her you're asleep."

> <font color=red>"There's a species of woman here who's waked the whole street up. What kind of a dirty business at this time of night!"</font>

>
> **💧表达精讲**

> ①a species of woman “不知道什么名堂的女人”；species本义是指“物种”，这里表示“某种类型（的人）”（a kind, variety, or type）, 比如："No species of performing artist is as self-critical as a dancer" — Susan Sontag（“所有的艺术家里，没有像舞蹈家那样严于律己的了。” — 苏珊·桑塔格）
>
> ②dirty 在这里指“不道德的，令人鄙夷的”（distasteful），比如：What a dirty trick!（多么卑鄙的伎俩！）

Then I heard Brett's voice. Half asleep I had been sure it was Georgette.

I don't know why. She could not have known my address.

"Will you send her up, please?"

Brett came up the stairs. I saw she was quite drunk.

"Silly thing to do," she said. "Make an awful row. I say, you weren't asleep, were you?"

"What did you think I was doing?"

"Don't know. What time is it?"

I looked at the clock. It was half-past four.

"Had no idea what hour it was," Brett said. "I say, can a chap sit down? Don't be cross, darling. Just left the count. He brought me here."

"What's he like?" I was getting brandy and soda and glasses.

"Just a little," said Brett. "Don't try and make me drunk. The count? Oh, rather. He's quite one of us."

"Is he a count?"<br>"Here's how. I rather think so, you know. Deservesto be, anyhow.

Knows hell's own amount about people. Don't know where he got it all. Owns a chain of sweetshops in the States."

> <font color=red>"Knows hell's own amount about people."</font>
>
> “多懂得人情世故啊。”
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> 这句话形容的是Brett的朋友给她介绍的那位法国伯爵（Count Mippipopolous）. amount在这里不是指数量quantity, 它在英英词典中有这样一个义项：the full effect, value, or significance. 所以amount about people可以理解为the important knowledge of people or humanity that should be known when you are dealing with people（在和人打交道的时候需要了解的相处之道或是对人性的洞察）。

She sipped at her glass.<br>"Think he called it a chain. Something like that. Linked them all up.

Told me a little about it. Damned interesting. He's one of us, though. Oh, quite. No doubt. One can always tell."

She took another drink."How do I buck on about all this? You don't mind, do you? He's putting up for Zizi, you know."

> <font color=red>"He's putting up for Zizi, you know."</font>
>
> “你知道的，他正在资助齐齐。”
>
> **💧表达精讲**

> put up 表示“提供（资助）”，常见的搭配是put up sth (money) for sb. 比如：The state agreed to put up \$69,000 to start his company.（国家同意出资​$69000创办他的公司。）
>
> *除了金钱上的帮助，put up还可以指“提供（食宿）”，比如： I wanted to know if she could put me up for a few days.（我想知道她能否让我留宿几天。） 

"Is Zizi really a duke, too?""I shouldn't wonder. Greek, you know. Rotten painter. I rather liked the count."

"Where did you go with him?"

"Oh, everywhere. He just brought me here now. Offered me ten thousand dollars to go to Biarritz (比亚里茨，法国西南端靠近西班牙的一座城市)with him. How much is that in pounds?"

"Around two thousand.""Lot of money. I told him I couldn't do it. He was awfully nice about it. Told him I knew too many people in Biarritz."

Brett laughed."I say, you are slow on the up-take," she said. I had only sipped my brandy and soda. I took a long drink.

> <font color=red>"I say, you are slow on the up-take," she said.</font>
>
> “咳，你反应太迟钝了，”她说道。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> uptake 本义是指“摄取量”（the amount of sth that is to take in or absorb）, 进而引申为“（对事物的）理解”（the understandings of things）. 所以quick/slow on the uptake就是指“理解/反应快或慢”，比如：She is not an intellectual, but is quick on the uptake.（她不是一个智力超群的人，但是理解事物却很快。） 

"That's better. Very funny," Brett said. "Then he wanted me to go to Cannes (戛纳，法国东南部的旅游胜地) with him.

Told him I knew too many people in Cannes. Monte Carlo (蒙特卡罗，摩纳哥著名的赌城). Told him I knew too many people in Monte Carlo. Told him I knew too many people everywhere. Quite true, too. So I asked him to bring me here."

She looked at me, her hand on the table, her glass raised. "Don't look like that," she said.

"Told him I was in love with you. True, too. Don't look like that. He was damn nice about it. Wants to drive us out to dinner to-morrow night. Like to go?"

"Why not?""I'd better go now.""Why?"

"Just wanted to see you. Damned silly idea. Want to get dressed and come down? He's got the car just up the Street."

"The count?""Himself. And a chauffeur in livery. Going to drive me around and have breakfast in the Bois ([法语]森林，这里指巴黎西郊的布洛涅森林).Hampers. Got it all at Zelli's (柴利饭店). Dozen bottles of Mumms (玛姆香槟，产自德国的烈性酒). Tempt you?"

"I have to work in the morning," I said. "I'm too far behind you now to catch up and be any fun."

"Don't be an ass.""Can't do it.""Right. Send him a tender message?""Anything. Absolutely."

"Good night, darling.""Don't be sentimental.""You make me ill."

We kissed good night and Brett shivered. "I'd better go," she said. "Good night, darling."

"You don't have to go.""Yes."

We kissed again on the stairs and as I called for the cordon the concierge muttered something behind her door.

I went back upstairs and from the open window watched Brett walking up the street to the big limousine drawn up to the curb under the arc-light.

She got in and it started off. I turned around. On the table was an empty glass and a glass half-full of brandy and soda.

I took them both out to the kitchen and poured the half-full glass down the sink.

I turned off the gas in the dining-room, kicked off my slippers sitting on the bed, and got into bed.

This was Brett, that I had felt like crying about.

Then I thought of her walking up the street and stepping into the car, as I had last seen her, and of course in a little while I felt like hell again.

It is awfully easy to be hard-boiled about everything in the daytime, but at night it is another thing.

> <font color=red>It is awfully easy to be hard-boiled about everything in the daytime, but at night it is another thing.</font>
>
> 在白天，我极容易就可以对什么都不动感情，但是一到夜里，就是另一码事了。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①awfully easy “极为容易”；awfully在这里单纯强调“非常”，没有“糟糕”这一层含义，和terribly类似。
>
> ②hard-boiled 字面上是指“（鸡蛋）煮得老硬的”（半熟或溏心的就是soft-boiled啦~），引申为“不动感情的，铁石心肠的”（unsentimental, tough）, hard-headed或hard-hearted也可以形容这类非常强悍的人。

### 背景知识

**💧Literature of Stream of Consciousness** 

**意识流文学**

今天要为大家介绍的是文学界里让很多人都“高山仰止”的一种写作手法——意识流（Stream of Consciousness）. 虽然海明威不是最典型的意识流作家，但是我们现在读的《太阳照常升起》里就有很多Jake的心理活动片段采用了这种描写手法（所以感觉情节很跳跃以及有不明所以的时候都是很正常的~）

意识流文学泛指注重描绘人物意识流动状态的文学作品，既包括清醒的意识，更包括无意识、梦幻意识和语言前意识。“意识流”一词源自心理学词汇，由美国机能主义心理学家先驱詹姆斯创造（coined by psychologist William James）, 用来表示意识的流动特性：个体的经验意识是一个统一的整体，但是意识的内容是不断变化的，从来不会静止不动。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/ec250d9af2ca0b407a50b4f74008d118-sz_33594.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



在表现手法上，意识流作家较多地采用了内心独白（interior monologue）、时序颠倒（reverse chronological order）的叙述方法；自由联想（free imagination）（包括事实与梦幻、现实与回忆的相互交织，来回流动）；类似蒙太奇（Montage）的衔接技巧，语言形式的离奇（unusual syntax）的试验以及舍弃标点符号（omission of punctuations）等等。

那么以意识流写作闻名的作家有哪些呢？



\1. Marcel Proust 马赛尔·普鲁斯特

他的著名长篇小说《追忆似水年华》（*Remembrance of Things Past*）（1913－1927）是意识流小说的奠基作。小说以叙述者“我”追忆往事为主线，插入了“我”的所见所闻。按人物思想流动的心理时间来结构作品，着意描写人物意识流程。以人物主观感受代替传统小说中人物命运、矛盾冲突的主导地位。作品突出带有“内审性”特征，被认为是“革新了题材与写作技巧的新型小说”。

\2. William Faulkner 威廉·福克纳

福克纳的代表作《喧哗与骚动》（*The Sound and the Fury*）（1929）和《追忆逝水年华》、《尤利西斯》并称为意识流小说的三大杰作。小说采用多角度的叙述手法讲述三兄弟与他们的姐妹凯蒂母女有关的故事，深入人物的潜意识，描写人物内心世界和病态心理。

\3. Virginia Woolf 弗吉尼亚·伍尔夫

伍尔夫的第一部意识流小说《墙上的斑点》（*The Mark on the Wall*）发表于1919年。她的小说不注重表现事件、人物之间的关系，而把创作重心放在对人物思想感情流程的再现上，讲究环境和景物描写的印象效果。她的文笔富于音乐性，并运用音乐上的“曲式学”结构作品，给读者以美感。

其他著名的作品比如《达洛维夫人》（*Mrs. Dalloway*）(1925)、《到灯塔去》（*To the Lighthouse*）（1927）也非常出色。《达洛维夫人》表现的是达洛维夫人在家庭晚会上重见旧日恋人彼德并得知附近一患精神病的男子自杀后二人意识的跳跃纷呈。

*这里再为大家推荐一部电影《时时刻刻》（*The Hours*）: 里面的三个主角通过《达洛维夫人》被联系在了一起，虽然身处不同时空，经历迥异，但人物精神内核都是女性的抗争和自由的表达。

意识流作品虽然在阅读上存在一定的门槛，但它最吸引人的地方也在于读者需要调动一定的想象和共情能力来理解情节，所以往往对人物的遭遇和处境有更深刻的体会~

### 课文理解

Jake回到家后并没有马上入睡，他的旧“伤疤”又被揭开，比如再次回想起自己受伤后在医院的经历。有两个隐晦的细节其实就印证了我们在前面所做的猜测——

💧**Clue 1**:  The wound is the kind that renders Jake unable to have sex.



**Evidence 1**: Of all the ways to be wounded. I suppose it was funny.

偏偏在那个地方受了伤。我看这是会惹人好笑的。



**Evidence 2**: Then he made that wonderful speech: "You, a foreigner, an Englishman" (any foreigner was an Englishman) "have given more than your life."

他就做了一番了不起的演说：“你，一个外国人，一个英国人（任何外国人在他看来都是英国人）做出了比牺牲生命更大的贡献。”



一方面要面对别人煞有介事的关怀（比如这位上校联络员对他说的这番话其实让Jake觉得很可笑），所以Jake只好自己也装作云淡风轻的样子来减轻痛苦（I try and play it along and just not make trouble for people）. 但另一方面，他又偏偏在这之后遇到了Brett（Probably I never would have had any trouble if I hadn't run into Brett when they shipped me to England）. 而他无法令Brett得到她想要的满足就成了Jake的一大心结（I suppose she only wanted what she couldn't have）, 这也成为了长久以来让他倍感挫败和无望的源头。



在今天的故事里，还有另外一个人物插入到了Jake和Brett的感情当中，也就是在酒吧的时候Brett的朋友Zizi为她介绍的一位法国的伯爵（Count Mippipopolous）, 半夜里开车把Brett送到Jake家楼底下的也是这个伯爵。他追求Brett的方式当然非常蛮横自我（"Offered me ten thousand dollars to go to Biarritz with him." "Then he wanted me to go to Cannes with him." — Brett）, 但在某种程度上，他和Jake截然不同，而且他和Brett更像是属于同一类人——



💧**Clue 2**: The Count is also in love with Brett but more of her kind.



**Evidence 1**: "Think he called it a chain. Something like that. Linked them all up. Told me a little about it. Damned interesting. He's one of us, though. Oh, quite. No doubt. One can always tell."

“我想他是把它们叫作连锁店。反正是类似的称呼。把一家家店都‘串起来’。给我讲了一点，太有趣了。不过他跟我们经历一样。啊，说真的。毫无疑问，这总是错不了的。”



*"He's one of us, though"是指这位伯爵曾经也参加过一战（Jake是战线士兵，而Brett是当时Jake受伤后所住的医院的护士，这个在后面的情节会提及。）



**Evidence 2**: "Himself. And a chauffeur in livery. Going to drive me around and have breakfast in the Bois. Hampers. Got it all at Zelli's. Dozen bottles of Mumms. Tempt you?"

“就他本人，还有一个穿着制服的司机。要带我兜一圈，然后到布洛涅森林去吃早饭。有几篮酒食，全是从柴利饭店弄得。成打的玛姆香槟。有诱惑力吧？”



伯爵做的是糖果店连锁生意，“连锁商店”这种形式在当时并不常见，所以Brett觉得很新颖有趣。而且她特别强调了"He's one of us, though", 说明伯爵和当时从一战退下来的其他年轻人不同，他自在地放纵在享乐里，生活依然斑斓多彩，而不是像Jake这样的缺乏刺激并且终日觉得苦闷。



最后当Brett邀请Jake一起加入的时候，Jake以自己体力欠佳并且第二天还要上班为由拒绝了（"I have to work in the morning," I said. "I'm too far behind you now to catch up and be any fun."）但最后从窗口目睹Brett上了伯爵的车的时候，Jake却是心痛不已，就跟上一次看着Brett离去一样（This was Brett, that I had felt like crying about. Then I thought of her walking up the street and stepping into the car, as I had last seen her, and of course in a little while I felt like hell again）.



面对这样不甘寂寞并且追求刺激的Brett，Jake深感无力，并且这种挫败感可能要比他身体上受的伤害更折磨人，接下来的故事就会围绕着他到底要如何去消解这种矛盾展开。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧【心理小百科】可能潜伏在我们身边的PTSD**



今天的内容里描写了一段Jake在入睡前意识突然非常混乱的经历：



I lay awake thinking and my mind jumping around. Then I couldn't keep away from it, and I started to think about Brett and all the rest of it went away. I was thinking about Brett and my mind stopped jumping around and started to go in sort of smooth waves. Then all of a sudden I started to cry. Then after a while it was better and I lay in bed and listened to the heavy trams go by and way down the street, and then I went to sleep.



其实这种对于过去痛苦记忆的闪回（flashbacks）以及突然情绪崩溃大哭（breakdown）都属于创伤后的应激反应障碍（Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, PTSD）的病症。 



PTSD的发生与很多因素相关联，这些因素主要分为家庭、社会心理因素（如性别、年龄、种族、婚姻状况、经济状况、社会地位、工作状况、受教育水平、应激性生活事件、个性特征、防御方式、童年期创伤、家庭暴力、战争、社会支持等）和生物学因素（如遗传因素、神经内分泌因素、神经生化因素等）。



这种情绪障碍最早源于一战，被称作“炮弹休克症”（Shell Shock）. 很多战士会不断闪回在战场上的血腥场面，虽然外在表现可能很正常，但内心却不断陷入在惨烈的场景当中。接着便会选择酗酒来麻醉自己，后半生都生活在战争的阴影里。



但当时医学界基于常识认为这种伤害是“震荡”的结果，也就是颅内大脑受到严重震荡，于是“炮弹休克”被认为是一种生理伤害，所有遭受“炮弹休克”的士兵在制服上都能有一条“伤兵带”，他们会被遣散并接受战争受伤赔偿。 还有误将其归结为“性格软弱”（weak character）和“意志不坚”（lack of moral fiber）的。但是随着战争深入，越来越多医学观点开始认为“炮弹休克”属于神经性疾病。



PTSD一般的临床表现会有：



1）反复体验创伤（reliving the trauma, "flashbacks"）

2）回避（avoidance）

3）高度警觉和过度反应（being highly alarmed and overreacting）

4）消极的认知和情绪（negative thinking and mood）



PTSD一般在精神创伤性事件发生后数天至6个月内发病，病程至少持续1个月以上，可长达数月或数年，个别甚至达数十年之久。而患者除了服用药物以外，还需要进行长期的心理治疗，包括认知行为治疗、催眠治疗等。



比如BBC拍摄的《神探夏洛克》里的华生医生，他从阿富汗战场上担任军医回国后就遭受了PTSD的折磨，所以第一季的开场就是他进行心理咨询的镜头。在后面的情节中，比如Mary去世，都导致了他PTSD的复发，包括做噩梦、盗汗等等。



这里为大家推荐两部电影，里面都涉及了从战场上退下来的战士遭受PTSD的情节——



一部是《敦刻尔克》：当船长道森先生在前往敦刻尔克的途中营救一位士兵时，那位被救上游艇的士兵神色十分恐惧、不愿意接受别人的帮助、易激惹，还和道森的助手发生了“肢体冲突”，结果助手因意外丧命。



另一部则是《比利·林恩的中场战事》：电影中比利和他所在的B班在橄榄球赛上和保安大打出手以及勒住说话不干净的球迷的脖子等暴力动作，其实都是PTSD的应激反应之一——过度警觉、产生不计后果的毁灭行为。



实际上，不是每个遭遇创伤的人都会发展成持续或慢性的PTSD，但同时也不是只有遭受过严重危险性事件（比如地震、战争）的人才会患上PTSD。任何生活中突发的刺激性事件（按照当事人的感觉和承受程度来衡量），比如爱人的突然死亡（unexpected death of a loved one）, 遭受性侵（sexual assault）, 或者是罹患致命的疾病（life-threatening illness）, 以及失恋和欺凌都会引起PTSD.



对于PTSD人群来说，创伤在时间流逝中会成为他们生活的一部分，除了应激反应，甚至还会带来人格上的伤疤，所以也格外需要身边的亲友给予足够的支持和关爱。

In the morning I walked down the Boulevard to the Rue Soufflot (索弗洛路，由卢森堡公园通向先贤祠)for coffee and brioche (奶油蛋卷).

It was a fine morning.

The horse-chestnut trees in the Luxembourg gardens (卢森堡公园) were in bloom.

>
> 1990年经济繁荣的国家并不多，尤其是像澳大利亚这样的黄金出口国。

There was the pleasant early-morning feeling of a hot day.

I read the papers with the coffee and then smoked a cigarette.

The flower-women were coming up from the market and arranging their daily stock.

Students went by going up to the law school, or down to the Sorbonne (索邦大学).

The Boulevard was busy with trams and people going to work.

I got on an S bus and rode down to the Madeleine (玛德琳教堂), standing on the back platform.

From the Madeleine I walked along the Boulevard des Capucines (卡布辛大街) to the Opéra, and up to my office.

I passed the man with the jumping frogs and the man with the boxer toys.

I stepped aside to avoid walking into the thread with which his girl assistant manipulated the boxers.

She was standing looking away, the thread in her folded hands.

The man was urging two tourists to buy.

Three more tourists had stopped and were watching.

I walked on behind a man who was pushing a roller that printed the name CINZANO (沁扎诺牌苦艾酒) on the sidewalk in damp letters.

All along people were going to work.

It felt pleasant to be going to work.

I walked across the avenue and turned in to my office.

Up-stairs in the office I read the French morning papers, smoked, and then sat at the typewriter and got off a good morning's work.

At eleven o'clock I went over to the Quai d'Orsay (原指奥赛码头，这里代指法国外交部)in a taxi and went in and sat with about a dozen correspondents, while the foreign-office mouthpiece, a young Nouvelle Revue Francaise diplomat in hornrimmed spectacles, talked and answered questions for half an hour.

The President of the Council was in Lyons (里昂) making a speech, or, rather he was on his way back.

Several people asked questions to hear themselves talk and there were a couple of questions asked by news service men who wanted to know the answers.

There was no news. I shared a taxi back from the Quai d'Orsay with Woolsey and Krum.

"What do you do nights, Jake?" asked Krum. "I never see you around."

"Oh, I'm over in the Quarter."

"I'm coming over some night. The Dingo. That's the great place, isn't it?"

"Yes. That, or this new dive, the Select."

"I've meant to get over," said Krum. "You know how it is, though, with a wife and kids."

"Playing any tennis?" Woolsey asked.

"Well, no," said Krum. "I can't say I've played any this year. I've tried to get away, but Sundays it's always rained, and the courts are so damned crowded."

"The Englishmen all have Saturday off," Woolsey said.

"Lucky beggars," said Krum.

"Well, I'll tell you. Some day I'm not going to be working for an agency. Then I'll have plenty of time to get out in the country."

"That's the thing to do. Live out in the country and have a little car."

"I've been thinking some about getting a car next year."

I banged on the glass. The chauffeur stopped.

"Here's my street," I said. "Come in and have a drink."

"Thanks, old man," Krum said.

Woolsey shook his head. "I've got to file that line he got off this morning."

I put a two-franc piece in Krum's hand.

"You're crazy, Jake," he said. "This is on me."

"It's all on the office, anyway."

"Nope. I want to get it."I waved good-by.

Krum put his head out."See you at the lunch on Wednesday."

"You bet."I went to the office in the elevator.

Robert Cohn was waiting for me. "Hello, Jake," he said. "Going out to lunch?"

"Yes. Let me see if there is anything new."

"Where will we eat?""Anywhere."

I was looking over my desk. "Where do you want to eat?"

"How about Wetzel's? They've got good hors d'oeuvres (冷盘)."

> ==hors d'oeuvres英 [ˌɔ: ˈdɜ:v] 美 [ˌɔ:r ˈdɜ:rv] n. 拼盘；餐前点心==

In the restaurant we ordered hors d'oeuvres and beer.

The sommelier brought the beer, tall, beaded on the outside of the stems, and cold.

There were a dozen different dishes of hors d'oeuvres.

"Have any fun last night?" I asked.

"No. I don't think so.""How's the writing going?"

"Rotten. I can't get this second book going."

"That happens to everybody.""Oh, I'm sure of that. It gets me worried, though."

"Thought any more about going to South America?""I mean that."

"Well, why don't you start off?""Frances."

"Well," I said, "take her with you."

"What do you know about Lady Brett Ashley, Jake?"

"Her name's Lady Ashley. Brett's her own name. She's a nice girl," I said.

"She's getting a divorce and she's going to marry Mike Campbell.

He's over in Scotland now. Why?"

"She's a remarkably attractive woman." "Isn't she?"

"There's a certain quality about her, a certain fineness. She seems to be absolutely fine and straight."

"She's very nice."

"I don't know how to describe the quality," Cohn said. "I suppose it's breeding."

"You sound as though you liked her pretty well."

"I do. I shouldn't wonder if I were in love with her."

"She's a drunk," I said.

"She's in love with Mike Campbell, and she's going to marry him. He's going to be rich as hell some day."

"I don't believe she'll ever marry him."

"Why not?""I don't know. I just don't believe it. Have you known her a long time?"

"Yes," I said. "She was a V. A. D. ina hospital I was in during the war."

"She must have been just a kid then."

"She's thirty-four now."

"When did she marry Ashley?"

"During the war. Her own true love had just kicked off with the dysentery."

"You talk sort of bitter."

"Sorry. I didn't mean to. I was just trying to give you the facts."

"I don't believe she would marry anybody she didn't love."

"Well," I said. "She's done it twice."

"I don't believe it."

"Well," I said, "don't ask me a lot of fool questions if you don't like the answers."

"I didn't ask you that.""You asked me what I knew about Brett Ashley."

"I didn't ask you to insult her.""Oh, go to hell."

He stood up from the table his face white, and stood there white and angry behind the little plates of horsd'ceuvres.

"Sit down," I said. "Don't be a fool."

"You've got to take that back.""Oh, cut out the prep-school stuff."

"Take it back.""Sure. Anything. I never heard of Brett Ashley. How's that?"

"No. Not that. About me going to hell."

"Oh, don't go to hell," I said. "Stick around. We're just starting lunch."

Cohn smiled again and sat down.He seemed glad to sit down.

What the hell would he have done if he hadn't sat down?

"You say such damned insulting things, Jake."

"I'm sorry. I've got a nasty tongue. I never mean it when I say nasty things."

"I know it," Cohn said. "You're really about the best friend I have, Jake."

God help you, I thought. "Forget what I said," I said out loud. "I'm sorry."

"It's all right. It's fine. I was just sore for a minute."

"Good. Let's get something else to eat."

After we finished the lunch we walked up to the Café de la Paix (和平咖啡馆) and had coffee.

I could feel Cohn wanted to bring up Brett again, but I held him off it.

### 背景知识

**💧V.A.D. Voluntary Aid Detachment**

**（英国）志愿救护队**

"Yes," I said. "She was a V. A. D. in a hospital I was in during the war."

Jake向Cohn透露，他和Brett在医院认识，当时的Brett在那担任V. A. D. 这个身份的全称是Valuntary Aid Detachment, 即“志愿救护队”（detachment有“分遣队，支队”的意思）.

这个救护队并不是属于国际组织的，而是特指在英国本土或是其他英属领地上的救护队，在1909年由英国红十字会（British Red Cross）和圣约翰骑士团（Order of St John）共同创立的。到1914年夏天，VAD的总人数已经都达到7万4千人，其中有三分之二都是女性。

一战爆发后，VAD积极加入到后勤医疗的救护中。但是一开始大部分的志愿者都来自中层或上层阶级，难以适应战场环境的艰苦和传统的医院制度的约束（unaccustomed to hardship and traditional hospital discipline）, 所以大部分人都只是在英国本土的医院从事志愿活动。并且由于专业知识和技能的缺乏（due to the lack of advanced knowledge and skills），军队医疗也不接受VAD的志愿者上前线服务。

起初VAD和军队医院难以相融，但随着战争的深入（as the war stretched on）, 这些志愿者们不断在学习医疗救护知识，并且也有相当一部分接受过护士训练的人加入到VAD中，所以二者关系逐渐缓和。在4年中，总计有3万8千名志愿者在军队中担任救护车司机以及负责炊事工作。

大家可能不知道有“侦探小说女王”之称的阿加莎·克里斯蒂（Agatha Christie）也曾经是VAD的一员。阿加莎出身于富有的中产阶级家庭，从小接受维多利亚式的教育，所以当她决定在一战爆发后加入VAD时一度令朋友非常惊讶。

起初，她在英格兰德文郡的海滨小镇托基（Torquay）做志愿护士。许多运送战地伤员的船只在此停靠。但这份工作并不轻松，她的传记作家珍妮特·摩根这样写道： “这份工作艰难而辛苦。工作场地一片混乱，臭气熏天。她后来在小说《巨人的面包》中也有所记述。”

她的研究专家约翰·柯伦博士也这样说道： “最初她是做护士，但由于一战战况激烈，很多伤员的伤口触目惊心。所以当她有机会转到药房工作时，她就欣然接受了。我认为在个人层面上，这样一个年轻女子，从小受维多利亚式教育，娇生惯养，突然看到那些断了胳膊或腿、失去眼睛的伤员，真的很难应对。”

但这段经历对她来说还有无比宝贵的一点，她在参加救护的过程中学习了不少药剂学的知识，因此在1917年参加药剂师协会的考试时顺利通过，并开始在托基市政厅大楼内的医院药房工作。更重要的是，丰富严谨的药理学知识还帮助阿加莎在之后的侦探小说里创作出精彩绝伦的谋杀诡计，其专业性甚至连药理专家都挑不出BUG.

根据阿加莎的红十字会工作证显示，她在1914年10月至1916年12月间，无偿服务了3400个小时。到1918年9月一战结束，她的志愿服务也告一段落。她认为志愿救护员是“任何人都可以追求的，最有成就感的职业之一”。

### 课文理解

今天内容的重头戏在Jake和Cohn一起吃午饭时的对话：Cohn主动向Jake询问关于Brett的情况，并且因为对Jake和Brett的关系毫无察觉，所以毫不避讳地谈到自己对Brett的爱慕（"She's a remarkably attractive woman."）还因为觉得Jake没说Brett的好话而不满发火。

Jake对Brett的感情很矛盾，并且由于嫉妒心作祟，他一开始夸Brett是个“好女孩”（"She's very nice."）但在听到Cohn对她赞不绝口的时候 ，又开始抖露Brett的另一面，比如她酗酒（"She's a drunk" ），以及跟很多男人纠缠不清——



💧**Clue 1**:  Brett has a rich experience in romance.

**Evidence 1**: "She's in love with Mike Campbell, and she's going to marry him. He's going to be rich as hell some day."

“她爱的是迈克尔·坎贝尔，而且她就要嫁给他了。而这个迈克尔迟早会发大财的。”

**Evidence 2**: "When did she marry Ashley?" "During the war. Her own true love had just kicked off with the dysentery."

“她什么时候嫁的阿什利？” “大战期间。她的真爱刚刚因为痢疾丧命了。”



这个Ashley是Brett的第一任丈夫，但并不是她的真爱，所以Cohn听到这里的时候很吃惊（"I don't believe she would marry anybody she didn't love."）而Jake则很轻描淡写地回答道这不是第一次了（"Well," I said. "She's done it twice."）其实就是暗指她即将要嫁给的这位Mike Campbell也不是她的真爱，可能只是因为他很快就要发达了（"He's going to be rich as hell some day"）.

但Cohn对于Brett的确是一个花蝴蝶这件事并不关注，而是反过来指责Jake的口气太不尊重了（"I didn't ask you to insult her."）并且对Jake的一句粗口（"Oh, go to hell."）勃然大怒（"You've got to take that back." "Take it back."），虽然Jake最后收回了自己的话（"Oh, don't go to hell," I said. "Stick around. We're just starting lunch."），但从中我们也可以观察到关于Jake的一个为人处世的特征：他通常会隐藏自己的真实感觉和想法——



💧**Clue 2**: Jake hides his feelings away most of the time.

**Evidence 1**: "You say such damned insulting things, Jake." "I'm sorry. I've got a nasty tongue. I never mean it when I say nasty things."

“你竟然说出这么无礼的话，杰克。” “很抱歉，我说话不好听。但心里可绝对不是那个意思。”

**Evidence 2**: "I know it," Cohn said. "You're really about the best friend I have, Jake."

God help you, I thought. "Forget what I said," I said out loud. "I'm sorry."

“我明白了”，科恩说。“实际上，你可算得上是我最好的朋友了，杰克。”

愿上帝保佑你，我心里寻思。“我说的话你可别往心里去，”我说出口来。“对不起。”



Jake对Cohn其实并无好感（大家可以回忆一下在第一天的情节里，Jake一直在尝试摆脱Cohn，不想听他叨唠个不停），这里也再一次描写他内心的真实想法：God help you. 这时候Jake大概的心理活动就是：“天哪，这个人竟然把我当成他最好的朋友。真可别这样！”但他说出口的时候又是另一番语气。可见Jake在与人的交往中较注重自我保护，或者说是倾向于维持表面的平和。这些是否都跟他之前受伤的经历有关呢？我们在之后会继续分析他的性格成因~

### 今日彩蛋

**💧餐厅酒侍是一个什么样的职业？**

In the restaurant we ordered hors d'oeuvres and beer. The sommelier brought the beer, tall, beaded on the outside of the stems, and cold.（到了饭店，我们点了冷盘和啤酒。酒侍端来啤酒，啤酒很凉，高筒酒杯外面结满水珠。）

这里的sommerlier可不是普通上茶端水的服务员，尤其在法国餐厅里，他们几乎可以算是和主厨地位同等重要的角色了。今天的彩蛋我们就来看一看酒侍到底是什么样的角色，以及一个优秀的酒侍都有哪些职责吧~

“酒侍（或酒侍）”（国际通用名称叫Sommelier）三个字，从字面意义上看，是指在宾馆、餐厅里负责酒水饮料的侍者。这也是大多数人对它的理解。而在今天，它的内涵已经延伸，一位好的酒侍不仅要具备专业酒水基础知识和技能，还要懂得设计葡萄酒配菜、具有葡萄酒的鉴赏能力、有深厚的葡萄酒品评基础、熟悉酒品采购要求以及善于对酒窖进行管理。酒侍要有基本的美学修养，有敏感的时尚感知，有高尚的品位，才能有好的鉴赏力，才能真的懂酒。

侍酒有两步非常重要的礼仪，如果做得不好，是会极度影响饭店的形象和声誉，直接导致一家饭店倒闭都有可能。



\1. 呈递礼仪

这个包括酒单呈递和酒瓶展示。首先葡萄酒酒单（Wine List）会详细列出葡萄酒产地、酒庄、等级、年份及价格等，有些也会将葡萄酒的特色，食物搭配建议等也列在酒单上，目前大多数餐厅都以提供葡萄酒酒单的方式让客人作选择，而酒单又只呈送给主人或主人指定的其他人。

然后是酒瓶展示，如果是展示葡萄酒的话，酒侍会将葡萄酒瓶放置在白布上，左手握住瓶身下方，右手握住瓶颈，将卷标朝上，保证客人能清楚地阅读酒标。



\2. 验酒礼仪

首先是客人验酒，在确认包括产地、酒庄、年份和温度等都没有问题后，酒侍才能够准备开瓶。

接下来酒侍开瓶醒酒：不同的酒开瓶方式不同，比如白葡萄酒要在冰桶内进行开酒，而红酒可在客人的餐桌上或餐厅推车上进行。以开瓶器在软木塞中心点位置插入，并以拇指导引方向，开瓶器从中心点徐徐地旋转进入，尽可能使开瓶器深入软木塞，但是也要避免穿透。拔出软木塞时，应保持朝正上方的方向拔除以避免木塞断裂。瓶塞拔除后要用清洁的口布小心地擦拭瓶口，尽量避免木屑掉入瓶内。  

开瓶后非常重要的一点就是醒酒，即将瓶中的葡萄酒倒入另一个容器中，主要有两种类型：

（1）老酒换新瓶，这样可以将沉淀物质去除，饮用时是否需要使用醒酒器视具体情况而定，因为有些老酒同空气大面积接触后会迅速氧化，香气会马上散去；

（2）年轻的葡萄酒在醒酒器中通过与空气大面积地接触来加速将其香气展现出来，另外也可以起到软化单宁的作用。

做酒侍真的不是一个容易的活，远非普通的服务员所能及，除了要有基本的美学修养，敏感的时尚感知、高尚的品位和鉴赏力，还要经过一定时间的培训，比如一个合格的酒侍的成长期至少要四五年，修炼成硕士品酒师还要差不多五年。

所以一个餐厅是否有酒侍在某种程度上也反映了该餐厅的等级段位，大家可以在去餐厅的时候观察一下哦~

At five o'clock I was in the Hotel Crillon (克里翁酒店) waiting for Brett.

She was not there, so I sat down and wrote some letters.

They were not very good letters but I hoped their being on Crillon stationery would help them.

> <font color=red>They were not very good letters / but I hoped / their being on Crillon stationery / would help them.</font>

Brett did not turn up, so about quarter to six I went down to the bar and had a Jack Rose (杰克玫瑰，鸡尾酒) with George the barman.

Brett had not been in the bar either,and so I looked for her up-stairs on my way out, and took a taxi to the café Select.

Crossing the Seine (塞纳河) I saw a string of barges being towed empty down the current, riding high, the bargemen at the sweeps as they came toward the bridge. The river looked nice. It was always pleasant crossing bridges in Paris.

>

The Boulevard Raspail always made dull riding.

It was like a certain stretch on the P.L.M. (巴黎-里昂-马赛路线) between Fontainebleau (枫丹白露) and Montereau (蒙特罗) that always made me feel bored and dead and dull until it was over.

I suppose it is some association of ideas that makes those dead places in a journey.

There are other streets in Paris as ugly as the Boulevard Raspail.

It is a street I do not mind walking down at all. But I cannot stand to ride along it. Perhaps I had read something about it once.

That was the way Robert Cohn was about all of Paris. I wondered where Cohn got that incapacity to enjoy Paris. Possibly from Mencken. Mencken hates Paris, I believe.

So many young men get their likes and dislikes from Mencken.

The taxi stopped in front of the Rotonde. No matter what café in Montparnasse (蒙帕纳斯) you ask a taxi-driver to bring you to from the right bank of the river, they always take you to the Rotonde (洛东达咖啡馆).

Ten years from now it will probably be the Dome (多姆咖啡馆). It was near enough, anyway.

I walked past the sad tables of the Rotonde to the Select.

There were a few people inside at the bar, and outside, alone, sat Harvey Stone. He had a pile of saucers in front of him, and he needed a shave.

"Sit down," said Harvey, "I've been looking for you." "What's the matter?"

"Nothing. Just looking for you."

"Been out to the races?" "No. Not since Sunday."

"What do you hear from the States?" "Nothing. Absolutely nothing."

"What's the matter?" "I don't know. I'm through with them. I'm absolutely through with them."

He leaned forward and looked me in the eye.

"Do you want to know something, Jake?" "Yes."

"I haven't had anything to eat for five days."

I figured rapidly back in my mind. It was three days ago that Harvey had won two hundred francs from me shaking poker dice in the New York Bar.

"What's the matter?" "No money. Money hasn't come," he paused. "I tell you it's strange, Jake. When I'm like this I just want to be alone. I want to stay in my own room. I'm like a cat."

I felt in my pocket. "Would a hundred help you any, Harvey?"

"Yes." "Come on. Let's go and eat." "There's no hurry. Have a drink." "Better eat."

"No. When I get like this I don't care whether I eat or not."

We had a drink. Harvey added my saucer to his own pile.

"Do you know Mencken, Harvey?" "Yes. Why?"

"What's he like?" "He's all right. He says some pretty funny things. Last time I had dinner with him we talked about Hoffenheimer. 'The trouble is,'he said, 'he's a garter snapper.' That's not bad."

"That's not bad." "He's through now," Harvey went on. "He's written about all the things he knows, and now he's on all the things he doesn't know."

"I guess he's all right," I said. "I just can't read him."

"Oh, nobody reads him now," Harvey said, "except the people that used to read the Alexander Hamilton Institute."

"Well," I said. "That was a good thing, too."

"Sure," said Harvey. So we sat and thought deeply for a while.

"Have another port?" "All right," said Harvey.

"There comes Cohn," I said. Robert Cohn was crossing the street.

"That moron," said Harvey. Cohn came up to our table.

> ==moron英 [ˈmɔ:rɒn] 美 [ˈmɔ:rɑ:n] n. <口>傻子；痴愚者==
>
> n. <口>傻子；痴愚者（指心理年龄在8至12岁的成年人）

>
> 💧moron 在口语里指一个人是“傻子，笨蛋”，和idiot一样很不礼貌。它的另一个含义是指“痴愚者”，也就是智力发育低下的（to describe someone whose intelligence has not developed to the normal level）.

"Hello, you bums," he said.

"Hello, Robert," Harvey said. "I was just telling Jake here that you're a moron." "What do you mean?"

"Tell us right off. Don't think. What would you rather do if you could do anything you wanted?"

Cohn started to consider. "Don't think. Bring it right out."

"I don't know," Cohn said. "What's it all about, anyway?"

"I mean what would you rather do. What comes into your head first. No matter how silly it is."

"I don't know," Cohn said. "I think I'd rather play football again with what I know about handling myself, now."

"I misjudged you," Harvey said. "You're not a moron. You're only a case of arrested development."

> ==misjudge英 [ˌmɪsˈdʒʌdʒ] 美 [mɪsˈdʒʌdʒ] vt. 对…判断错误；错认；错误地估计 vi. 判断错==

"You're awfully funny, Harvey," Cohn said. "Some day somebody will push your face in."

Harvey Stone laughed. "You think so. They won't, though. Because it wouldn't make any difference to me.I'm not a fighter."

"It would make a difference to you if anybody did it."

"No, it wouldn't. That's where you make your big mistake. Because you're not intelligent."

"Cut it out about me." "Sure," said Harvey. "It doesn't make any difference to me. You don't mean anything to me."

"Come on, Harvey," I said. "Have another porto."

"No," he said. "I'm going up the street and eat. See you later, Jake."

He walked out and up the street. I watched him crossing the street through the taxis, small, heavy, slowly sure of himself in the traffic.

"He always gets me sore," Cohn said. "I can't stand him."

"I like him," I said. "I'm fond of him. You don't want to get sore at him."

"I know it," Cohn said. "He just gets on my nerves."

"Write this afternoon?" "No. I couldn't get it going. It's harder to do than my first book. I'm having a hard time handling it."

The sort of healthy conceit that he had when he returned from America early in the spring was gone. Then he had been sure of his work, only with these personal longings for adventure.

Now the sureness was gone. Somehow I feel I have not shown Robert Cohn clearly.

The reason is that until he fell in love with Brett, I never heard him make one remark that would, in anyway, detach him from other people.

He was nice to watch on the tennis-court, he had a good body, and he kept it in shape; he handled his cards well at bridge, and he had a funny sort of undergraduate quality about him.

If he were in a crowd nothing he said stood out. He wore what used to be called polo shirts at school, and may be called that still, but he was not professionally youthful.

I do not believe he thought about his clothes much.

Externally he had been formed at Princeton. Internally he had been moulded by the two women who had trained him.

He had a nice, boyish sort of cheerfulness that had never been trained out of him, and I probably have not brought it out.

> ①that had never been trained out of him 强调“这种劲头并没有因为外力而被磨灭掉”；这里作者的用词很值得考究，train作动词最常见的意思是“训练”，在这里更准确的理解是“磨炼、塑造一个人的品格或行为”（to accustom sb to a mode of behavior or performance）.
>
> *这个句子也可以结合上文来理解：Externally he had been formed... Internally he had been moulded... 所以这里是一个转折，虽然Cohn的外表和内在都受到了不同方面的影响，但他的这种cheerfulness依然没有任何削减。

He loved to win at tennis. He probably loved to win as much as Lenglen, for instance.

On the other hand, he was not angry at being beaten. When he fell in love with Brett his tennis game went all to pieces.

>

> *所以his tennis game went all to pieces就是指Cohn在网球比赛中不再像以前一样所向披靡，而是表现得很糟糕，或者说是屡屡战败。

People beat him who had never had a chance with him. He was very nice about it.

Anyhow, we were sitting on the terrace of the café Select, and Harvey Stone had just crossed the street.

"Come on up to the Lilas," I said. "I have a date."

"What time?" "Frances is coming here at seven-fifteen." "There she is."

Frances Clyne was coming toward us from across the street. She was a very tall girl who walked with a great deal of movement. She waved and smiled. We watched her cross the street.

"Hello," she said, "I'm so glad you're here, Jake. I've been wanting to talk to you."

"Hello, Frances," said Cohn. He smiled.

"Why, hello, Robert. Are you here?" She went on, talking rapidly. "I've had the darndest time. This one"--shaking her head at Cohn--"didn't come home for lunch."

"I wasn't supposed to."

"Oh, I know. But you didn't say anything about it to the cook. Then I had a date myself, and Paula wasn't at her office. I went to the Ritz and waited for her, and she never came,and of course I didn't have enough money to lunch at the Ritz--"

"What did you do?" "Oh, went out, of course." She spoke in a sort of imitation joyful manner. "I always keep my appointments. No one keeps theirs, nowadays. I ought to know better. How are you, Jake, anyway?"

"Fine." "That was a fine girl you had at the dance, and then went off with that Brett one."

"Don't you like her?" Cohn asked.

"I think she's perfectly charming. Don't you?" Cohn said nothing.

"Look, Jake. I want to talk with you. Would you come over with me to the Dome? You'll stay here, won't you, Robert? Come on, Jake."

We crossed the Boulevard Montparnasse and sat down at a table. A boy came up with the Paris Times, and I bought one and opened it.

"What's the matter, Frances?"

"Oh, nothing," she said, "except that he wants to leave me."

"How do you mean?" "Oh, he told every one that we were going to be married, and I told my mother and every one, and now he doesn't wantto do it."

"What's the matter?" "He's decided he hasn't lived enough. I knew it would happen when he went to New York."

She looked up, very bright-eyed and trying to talk inconsequentially.

### 背景知识

**💧Henry Louis Mencken 亨利·路易斯·门肯**

Jake和朋友Harvey聊天的时候，反复提到了一个作家，也就是Mencken. 在Jake看来，Cohn很有可能就是因为看了Mencken的书而不喜欢巴黎的（Paris. I wondered where Cohn got that incapacity to enjoy Paris. Possibly from Mencken. Mencken hates Paris, I believe）.

那么门肯究竟是一个什么人物，而海明威又为什么在小说里安插了这个情节呢？接着我们就来了解一下~

门肯（Mencken）（1880-1956）是一位锋芒毕露的散文家、文学批评家。他从事过新闻行业，写散文、讽刺文、文化批评，还是美国英语（American English）的学者。他撰文批评的对象不仅包括社会场所、文学、音乐，还有政治家以及当代运动等。

作为学者，门肯最有名的学术著作要属出版于1919年的《美国语言》（*The American Language*），这本书是在语言学术界广受赞誉。它对美式英文与英式英文进行了对照，并解释了许多富有趣味的美国俚语表达方式之起源，检视美国特殊的地理名称及个人名字，以及分析外来语言语言对美国方言所造成的影响。

作为批评家，他也以擅长过讽刺漫画不露痕迹的讽刺挖苦闻名。一次世界大战结束后，他与人合作创办了《美国信使》杂志，以该杂志为阵地激烈地批评了美国所谓“民主社会”的种种弊端和缺陷，指出美国在文化上所表现出的贫困。同时门肯又坚决主张摆脱欧洲对美国的“保护”，建立起本国的文明。

在文艺方面，门肯提倡创作自由，反对种种清规戒律，认为“作家有描绘他周围生活的自由，他怎么看就怎么写，他爱怎么解释就怎么解释。”

但海明威笔下的主角对他似乎都评价不高，比如Jake的朋友Harvey这样说道："He's through now," Harvey went on. "He's written about all the things he knows, and now he's on all the things he doesn't know."（“门肯的才智已经枯竭了，”哈维接着说。“”凡是他所熟悉的事，几乎全部写完了，现在他着手写的都是他不熟悉的。）

以及："Oh, nobody reads him now," Harvey said, "except the people that used to read the Alexander Hamilton Institute."（唉，现在没人看他的书了，”哈维说，“除非是那些在亚历山大·汉密尔顿学院念过书的人。”）

*Alexander Hamilton Institute 是美国顶尖的私立文理学院，学校宣称自己是全美第二写作能力大学。（文理学院又称“博雅学院”，以本科教育为主，即规模小而精的大学）

关于海明威为什么在书中讽刺甚至贬低作为公共知识分子的门肯，研究海明威的学者很多认为是因为他有“反智主义”（Anti-intellectualism）的倾向，至少他对知识和书本对人的影响是持一定怀疑态度的。简单来说，他认为“书本知识让知识分子无法根据自己的内心作出判断，有点失去自我，甚至变得狭隘和极端”（比如他借Jake之口说很多年轻人的好恶都受门肯影响：“So many young men get their likes and dislikes from Mencken”）.

在小说开头Jake对Cohn因为看了《紫色大地》这本书而开始产生不切实际的想象也是嗤之以鼻的态度（Cohn觉得南美可以让他摆脱心魔，而巴黎的一切都是可厌的），在Jake看来这都是书本知识的影响。

海明威的这种倾向也反应在了他的写作方式上，比如他更注重塑造真正的“人”，而不是存在于作者想象里的，这样的人的特征不是爱天马行空不切实的的，而是“不谈艺术和文学，生活不受思想约束，重视本能和行动。”

### 课文理解

今天的内容故事情节比较轻，因为它的主要目的是塑造人物形象，也就是小说写作手法当中的characterization. 首先是对Jake的性格和气质进行了丰满，比如有两个细节——

💧**Clue 1**:  Jake is generous and sympathetic to some extent.

**Evidence 1**: I figured rapidly back in my mind. It was three days ago that Harvey had won two hundred francs from me shaking poker dice in the New York Bar.

我脑子里马上闪过哈维三天前在“纽约”酒吧间玩扑克骰子赢了我两百法郎的事。

**Evidence 2**: I felt in my pocket. "Would a hundred help you any, Harvey?"

我摸摸自己的口袋。“一百法郎能派上用场吗，哈维？”

首先关于Harvey，从很多地方可以推测出他可能有酗酒的习惯，比如Cohn在街上看到他的时候，他就坐在酒吧外，面前堆了一摞碟子，胡子也好几天没刮了（He had a pile of saucers in front of him, and he needed a shave）. 并且三天前他才从Jake这里赢了两百法郎，结果现在就花光了（"No money. Money hasn't come," he paused）. 这时候Jake便主动提出要资助他一百法郎，丝毫不计较Harvey之前打牌赢了他的事情。当然这也可能是因为Jake本身对Harvey颇具好感（"I like him," I said. "I'm fond of him. You don't want to get sore at him"）.



除了对朋友慷慨大方并且颇具同情心外，Jake的另一个特征是（似乎跟《了不起的盖茨比》里Nick的角色设定非常相似），他身边的人，尤其女性，都愿意和他分享秘密——

💧**Clue 2**: Jake is the sort of person in whom others, especially women, feel comfortable confiding.

**Evidence 1**: "Look, Jake. I want to talk with you. Would you come over with me to the Dome? You'll stay here, won't you, Robert? Come on, Jake."

“听着，杰克，我有话和你说。你陪我到多姆咖啡馆去好吗？罗伯特你就在这待着，行不行？走吧，杰克。”

**Evidence 2**: "What's the matter, Frances?"

"Oh, nothing," she said, "except that he wants to leave me."

"How do you mean?"

"Oh, he told every one that we were going to be married, and I told my mother and every one, and now he doesn't want to do it."

“什么事，弗朗西丝？”

“哦，没什么，”她说，“就是他打算抛弃我了。”

“你这是什么意思？”

“唉，他以前逢人就嚷嚷我们要结婚，我也告诉了我的母亲和诸亲好友，可现在他又要反悔了。”

不仅是Cohn喜欢找Jake聊心事，这回是Cohn的对象Frances也来找Jake谈她和Cohn之间的私事了。这从侧面反映出了Jake很得身边朋友的信任，还有另外一个原因是，我们在昨天也分析过了，Jake倾向于维持人与人之间的表面平和，所以他从不轻易表露自己的喜好或厌恶，也不随意地论断。这种品质也让他拥有了一个在逻辑上合理的“参与者及叙述者”的双重身份。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧Comebacks For Dealing With Sarcastic People**

**怎么机智地回应别人的讽刺挖苦？**



今天Jake的一位朋友Harvey因为很讨厌Cohn，所以冷嘲暗讽地羞辱了他一番。比如他最后干脆不直接说Cohn是蠢蛋（moron），而是改为暗地插刀式的："I misjudged you," Harvey said. "You're not a moron. You're only a case of arrested development."（“我误解你了，”哈维说，“你不是白痴，你只是发育过程出现障碍的一个病例而已。”）

Cohn当然火冒三丈气不打一处来，但他也采用了一种非常错误的反击方式，也就是直接攻击对方："You're awfully funny, Harvey," Cohn said. "Some daysomebody will push your face in."（“你这人说话太放肆，哈维，”科恩说。“总有一天人家会把你的脸揍扁的。”）

结果又被Harvey狠狠将了一军："You think so. They won't, though. Because it wouldn't make any difference to me. I'm not a fighter."（就是你这样想。人家才不会呐。我又不是拳击手，我才不用担心自己的脸被人揍扁。）言下之意是，Cohn自己之前在拳击比赛里还被人把鼻子给打扁了。

其实像Harvey这样的人在生活中并不少见，但无论对方出于何种目的，我们都应该明白两件事：一是不要忍气吞声；二是不要直接反击。那么有什么机智的回应方式呢？今天的彩蛋我们就一起来看看~



\1. "I would like to insult you back but I'm afraid you wouldn't understand me."

“我很想回击你，但我担心你听不懂。”

讽刺者的目的就是要让你觉得他们说的话是针对你的（Sarcasm forces you to think and take things personally）, 最好的解决方式就是不要让对方觉得你当真了，并且不要留下把柄让对方再对你进行反击。所以可以表现出不予置评的态度。



\2. "I don't understand your type of craziness, but I sure admire your commitment to it."

“我搞不懂你在说什么胡话，但我认可你的作的所有努力。”

如果对方是因为一件事情而受到刺激才对你恶语相向，那么你就明确地表示，你对于他（她）作的努力和所有付出是认可的，让他能够冷静地思考问题并且表达自己的诉求（to put them back in their place），然后微笑转身离开（just walk away with a smile on your face）.



\3. "I'm afraid I can't say much since I would be talkig outside of your emotional zip code."

“我不能再多说了。咱俩频率不对，我怕你接收不到。”

沉默是金（Silence is golden）, 谨记这一点。或者把讽刺的话当成另一种幽默，然后以同样的幽默回复对方。



\4. "Remember when I asked for your opinion? Me neither."

“你能想起我什么时候问你意见了吗？反正我是想不起来。”

直接让对方知道他们只是在多管闲事，你不需要他们的意见，这样对方自然就会哑口无言了。

But it does seem to me to be a little late now, after we've waited three years, and I've just gotten my divorce."

I said nothing."We were going to celebrate so, and instead we've just had scenes. It's so childish. We have dreadful scenes, and he cries and begs me to be reasonable, but he says he just can't do it."

"Sure, you could marry anybody." "No, I don't believe it. And I'm fond of him, too. And I'd like to have children. I always thought we'd have children."

She looked at me very brightly. "I never liked children much, but I don't want to think I'll never have them.

I always thought I'd have them and then like them." "He's got children."

"Oh, yes. He's got children, and he's got money, and he's got a rich mother, and he's written a book, and nobody will publish my stuff, nobody at all.

It isn't bad, either. And I haven't got any money at all. I could have had alimony, but I got the divorce the quickest way."

>
> 他们必须找到那些抛弃子女的父亲，让他们支付抚养费。

She looked at me again very brightly. "It isn't right. It's my own fault and it's not, too.

I ought to have known better. And when I tell him he just cries and says he can't marry.

" Why can't he marry? I'd be a good wife. I'm easy to get along with. I leave him alone. It doesn't do any good."

"It's a rotten shame." "Yes, it is a rotten shame. But there's no use talking about it, is there? Come on, let's go back to the café."

"And of course there isn't anything I can do." "No. Just don't let him know I talked to you.

I know what he wants." Now for the first time she dropped her bright, terribly cheerful manner.

"He wants to go back to New York alone, and be there when his book comes out so when a lot of little chickens like it. That's what he wants."

"Maybe they won't like it. I don't think he's that way. Really."

"You don't know him like I do, Jake.That's what he wants to do. I know it. I know it.

That's why he doesn't want to marry. He wants to have a big triumph this fall all by himself."

"Want to go back to the café?" "Yes. Come on."

We got up from the table--they had never brought us a drink-- and started across the street toward the Select, where Cohn sat smiling at us from behind the marble-topped table.

"Well, what are you smiling at?" Frances asked him. "Feel pretty happy?"

"I was smiling at you and Jake with your secrets."

"Oh, what I've told Jake isn't any secret. Everybody will know it soon enough. I only wanted to give Jake a decent version."

"What was it? About your going to England?"

"Yes, about my going to England. Oh, Jake! I forgot to tell you. I'm going to England."

"Isn't that fine!" "Yes, that's the way it's done in the very best families.

Robert's sending me. He's going to give me two hundred pounds and then I'm going to visit friends.

> <font color=red>Robert's sending me.</font>
>
> 罗伯特要打发我。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> send 在这里不是“送某人去某地”，而是一种带有不满和敷衍的“打发”。还有语气更重的一个表达：send sb packing 表示“撵走，让某人收拾东西走人”，比如：After his four years as governor, the voters sent him packing.（他当了四年州长之后，选民叫他滚蛋了。）
>
> 这里再为大家拓展send的一个用法：send sb/sth into (doing) sth. 后面一般加表示状态或情绪的名词，比如send sb into panic就是“使某人陷入惊慌”，send the country plunging into anarchy “使这个国家陷入混乱/无政府状态中”（plunge into表示“陷入”）。

Won't it be lovely? The friends don't know about it, yet."

She turned to Cohn and smiled at him. He was not smiling now.

"You were only going to give me a hundred pounds, weren't you, Robert? But I made him give me two hundred.

He's really very generous. Aren't you, Robert?"

I do not know how people could say such terrible things to Robert Cohn.

There are people to whom you could not say insulting things.

They give you a feeling that the world would be destroyed, would actually be destroyed before your eyes, if you said certain things.

But here was Cohn taking it all. Here it was, all going on right before me, and I did not even feel an impulse to try and stop it. And this was friendly joking to what went on later.

"How can you say such things, Frances?" Cohn interrupted.

"Listen to him. I'm going to England.I'm going to visit friends.

Ever visit friends that didn't want you? Oh, they'll have to take me, all right. How do you do, my dear?

Such a long time since we've seen you. And how is your dear mother?

' Yes, how is my dear mother? She put all her money into French war bonds. Yes, she did. Probably the only person in the world that did. And what about Robert?'

or else very careful talking around Robert. You must be most careful not to mention him, my dear. Poor Frances has had a most unfortunate experience.

' Won't it be fun, Robert? Don't you think it will be fun, Jake?"

She turned to me with that terribly bright smile. It was very satisfactory to her to have an audience for this.

"And where are you going to be, Robert? It's my own fault, all right. Perfectly my own fault.

When I made you get rid of your little secretary on the magazine I ought to have known you'd get rid of me the same way.

Jake doesn't know about that. Should I tell him?"

"Shut up, Frances, for God's sake."

"Yes, I'll tell him. Robert had a little secretary on the magazine.

Just the sweetest little thing in the world, and he thought she was wonderful, and then I came along and he thought I was pretty wonderful, too.

So I made him get rid of her, and he had brought her to Province town from Carmel when he moved the magazine, and he didn't even pay her fare back to the coast.

All to please me. He thought I was pretty fine, then. Didn't you, Robert?

"You mustn't misunderstand, Jake, it was absolutely platonic with the secretary. Not even platonic. Nothing at all, really. It was just that she was so nice.

"You know Robert is going to get material for a new book. Aren't you, Robert? That's why he's leaving me.He's decided I don't film well.

“You see, he was so busy all the time that we were living together, writing on this book, that he doesn't remember anything about us.

“So now he's going out and get some new material. Well, I hope he gets something frightfully interesting.

"Listen, Robert, dear. Let me tell you something. You won't mind, will you?

“Don't have scenes with your young ladies. Try not to. Because you can't have scenes without crying, and then you pity yourself so much you can't remember what the other person's said.

“You'll never be able to remember any conversations that way. Just try and be calm.

I know it's awfully hard. But remember, it's for literature. We all ought to make sacrifices for literature.

“He doesn't read French very well himself. He wasn't a good writer like you are, was he, Robert?

“Do you think he ever had to go and look for material? What do you suppose he said to his mistresses when he wouldn't marry them?

“I'll tell you. It's so simple. I wonder why I never thought about it.

“Why, you see, Robert's always wanted to have a mistress, and if he doesn't marry me, why, then he's had one.

“She was his mistress for over two years. See how it is? And if he marries me, like he's always promised he would, that would be the end of all the romance.

Don't you think that's bright of me to figure that out? It's true, too. Look at him and see if it's not. Where are you going, Jake?"

"I've got to go in and see Harvey Stone a minute."

Cohn looked up as I went in. His face was white. Why did he sit there? Why did he keep on taking it like that?

As I stood against the bar looking out I could see them through the window.

Frances was talking on to him, smiling brightly, looking into his face each time she asked: "Isn't it so, Robert?"

Or maybe she did not ask that now.Perhaps she said something else.

I told the barman I did not want anything to drink and went out through the side door.

As I went out the door I looked back through the two thicknesses ofglass and saw them sitting there.

She was still talking to him. I went down a side street to the Boulevard Raspail (拉斯拜尔大街).

A taxi came along and I got in and gave the driver the address of my flat.

### 背景知识

**💧****Live by the sword, die by the sword**

**凡动刀者，必死于刀下**

"Well, I suppose that we that live by the sword shall perish by the sword. Isn't that literary, though? You want to remember that for your next book, Robert."（“依我看，凡动刀的必死于刀下。这不是文学语言吗？你写第二本书的时候，别忘了把这个写进去，罗伯特。”）

Frances对着Cohn讽刺了一番，而且自嘲说正是因为自己当初是通过强逼的方式得到Cohn并且让他抛弃了他的小秘书 ，所以今天Cohn用一样的方式抛弃了她。这里的that (who) live by the sword shall perish by the sword现在已经成为一句很日常的俚语表达，意思就和我们说“遭报应”很像，但它的来源其实是《圣经》里的一个故事，在《约翰福音》里有记载——

当时的耶稣和使徒在客西马尼园（Garden of Gethsemane）祷告，其中一位使徒（disciple）就是彼得（Peter）. 犹大（Judas）在出卖耶稣的藏身之地后，罗马士兵便赶来要逮捕耶稣。彼得为了保护耶稣 ，便拔刀割下了大祭司（the high priest）仆人的一只耳朵。

这时候耶稣制止了彼得有进一步的危险举动，让他赶紧收刀入鞘，不要再发生流人血的事（Jesus rebuked Peter and put a quick stop to the bloodshed）. 随后耶稣奇迹般的使那个人的耳朵复原并痊愈了。在这后，他就对彼得说了这句“all who draw the sword will die by the sword”.

耶稣想告诫彼得的其实就是，不要用暴力解决暴力（Violence begets violence, but don't end violence） ，否则最后也要自食其果（如果不是耶稣及时阻止，而彼得真的动刀杀了人的话，他也会被逮捕）。

### 课文理解

Frances向Jake哭诉Cohn如何不愿意娶她，她怀疑Cohn就是为了能回到纽约，等他的书出版后就能吸引来一大群年轻女孩的仰慕（"He wants to go back to New York alone, and be there when his book comes out so when a lot of little chickens like it. That's what he wants."）

但Frances对Cohn的“言语霸凌”还不止于此，甚至到了Jake都觉得难以忍受的地步，更让Jake惊讶的是Cohn的无动于衷，他丝毫没有为自己辩解——



💧**Clue 1**:  Frances insults Cohn, but he doesn't stand up for himself.

**Evidence 1**: I do not know how people could say such terrible things to Robert Cohn. There are people to whom you could not say insulting things...But here was Cohn taking it all.

我不明白怎么能当着科恩的面说得这么吓人。往往有这样的人，听不得刻薄话。你一说刻薄话，他们就会暴跳如雷，好像当场天就会塌下来……但是科恩却乖乖地听着。

**Evidence 2**: Cohn looked up as I went in. His face was white. Why did he sit there? Why did he keep on taking it like that?

我走进酒吧间的时候，科恩抬头看着。他脸色煞白。他为什么还坐在那里不走？为什么继续那样受她的数落？

这里再一次展现了Cohn在两性关系中的自卑感，对自我认知的摇摆不定导致他只能受控于Frances. 虽然他从纽约回来后曾经“风光”过一段时间，觉得自己的确拥有吸引女人的魅力，但在重新回归到巴黎的平凡生活中后，这种自信逐渐消退，Cohn又开始变得小心翼翼起来。比如他对Frances的迁就和忍耐："Tell her to go to hell." "I can't. I've got certain obligations to her." — Chapter 5（“告诉她让她见鬼去吧。” “我不能这么做，我对她有责任的。”）



也正是因为这种懦弱性，Cohn在感情里也从来不是一个忠诚的投入者——

💧**Clue 2**:  Cohn has little devotion to romance.

**Evidence 1**: "So I made him get rid of her, and he had brought her to Provincetown from Carmel when he moved the magazine, and he didn't even pay her fare back to the coast. All to please me."

“所以我就叫他把她打发走。当初杂志社迁移的时候，他把她从卡默尔带到了普罗文斯敦，可这时他连回西海岸的旅费也不给她。这一切都是为了讨好我。”

**Evidence 2**: "Why, you see, Robert's always wanted to have a mistress, and if he doesn't marry me, why, then he's had one...And if he marries me, like he's always promised he would, that would be the end of all the romance."

“哦，你知道，罗伯特一直想有个情妇，如果他不跟我结婚，哼，那么他就有我这个情妇……一旦他和我结婚了，正如他经常答应的那样，那么他的整个浪漫史也就告终了。”

Frances口中的Cohn就是那种只会空口承诺但从来不愿意跟你结婚的男人。其实根据Cohn之前的经历也不难看出他在感情中缺乏忠诚和投入。比如他认识Frances的时候正和自己的秘书暧昧，在杂志社迁址的时候还一起带上了她，但当他遇到更风采迷人的Frances后，便把对方撵走了，甚至连回去的旅费都不愿意付。因此当这一次他又陷入了对Brett的迷恋时，他就以自己要去收集写作素材为由离开Frances.

Cohn这个角色有可怜但也有可恨之处，所以Jake对他一直缺乏好感，也就不奇怪他虽然感觉Frances的刻薄话未免太过分，但也没有想要去劝阻的冲动（Here it was, all going on right before me, and I did not even feel an impulse to try and stop it.） 

### 今日彩蛋

**💧古希腊人眼里爱的七种形式**

"You mustn't misunderstand, Jake, it was absolutely platonic with the secretary."（“你千万别误解，杰克，和女秘书的关系纯属精神恋爱。”）

Frances在这里讽刺Cohn和女秘书之间只是“柏拉图式恋爱”，也就是精神恋爱，所以他在遇到风姿绰约的Frances后便把女秘书抛弃了。

“柏拉图式恋爱”（Platonic love）并不是柏拉图自己创造出来的名词，而是后人Marsilio Ficino在15世纪的时候提出来的。最早柏拉图对这种“恋爱关系”的解释是在哲学层面上的，也就是两个人在逐渐超越肉体上的吸引（carnal attraction）并在灵魂上更为亲密的过程中，同时也更接近智慧和真理，直到最后两个人在真理中合而为一。在当时，这种恋爱关系区别于“浪漫式恋爱”（Romantic love）而存在。

后来“柏拉图式恋爱”在演变中有了更具体的分支，也就是“爱的七种形式”，包括“厄洛斯之爱”（Eros）、“菲莉亚之爱”（Philia）、“思多奇之爱”（Storge）、“阿加普之爱”（Agape）、“卢多斯之爱”（Ludus）、“普拉玛之爱”（Pragma）和“腓利塔之爱”（Philautia）. 那么这七种爱都有什么形式和要义呢？我们分别来看看~



1.厄洛斯之爱 Eros love

厄洛斯是希腊中掌管爱和性欲的神（the Greek God of sensual love and desire）. 这个神在罗马神话中对应的就是丘比特（Cupid）啦~ 

在《神谱》中赫西俄德是这样描述厄洛斯神的：“永生神中数他最美，他使全身酥麻，让所有神和人思谋和才智尽失在心怀深处。”据说他会在没有警告的情况下向凡人和神仙射出金箭。希腊人最怕那种爱，因为它是危险的，能使他们陷入最麻烦的境地。

所以“厄洛斯之爱”就是肉体的、情欲的爱。



2.菲莉亚之爱 Philia love

Philia love通常也会写作Brotherly love, 也就是“兄弟之爱”。而在亚里士多德的著作中，Philia则通常被翻译为friendship或affection. 

亚里士多德还列举出了所有可以被称之为Philia的关系，比如：“年轻恋人”（young lovers）、“终生挚友”（lifelong friends）、“政治或生意上的关系”（political or business contacts）、“同行的航海员”（fellow-voyagers）、“战友”（fellow-soldiers）、“同一个宗教组织里的教友”（members of the same religious society）.

简单来说，Philia就是包含着真诚、友好以及信任的关系，可以是合作或是相互依赖的形式（the type of love that is directed towards friendship orgoodwill, often is met with mutual benefits that can also can be formed by companionship, dependability, and trust）. 所以Philia love可以理解为“兄弟/朋友/同僚之爱”。



3.思多奇之爱 Storge love

Storge love也可以翻译为familial love, 也就是“家庭/父母之爱”，一般是指“自然而生的，或是由于本能而产生的好感”（natural or instinctual affection）. 

并且Storge love之中还有很重要的一条准则，也就是这种爱是单边的（unilateral）, 也就是不需要依靠互利（mutual benefit）而存在。这一点和我们上面提到的Philia love很不同。



4.阿加普之爱 Agape love

Agape love被认为是最高形式的爱（"the highest form of love, charity"）, 它还代表了人和上帝之间的爱（"the love of God for man and of man for God"）. 这种爱具有普世性（universal），可以是对陌生人的，或是对于自然万物的，含义非常广泛。

因此Agape love也就是“无私、奉献、无条件之爱”（selfless, sacrificial, unconditional）.



5.卢多斯之爱 Ludus love

Ludus来自拉丁文lusus, 最早的含义和"play, game, sport, training"相关。所以Ludus love倾向于指“玩伴、挑逗或揶揄之爱”（a playful and uncommitted love）, 这种爱不需要承诺，一般以玩乐为目的（focues for fun）. 或者其中一方将另一方视为自己的“俘虏”（conquest）, 占有优势地位。



6.普拉玛之爱 Pragma love

Pragma love被认为是最实际的一种爱（the most practical）, 一般基于责任和理性（duty and reason）以及长期的利益（longer tern interests）, 不需要有所谓的“浪漫感觉”（romantic affection）.

在Pragma love之中，双方都有强烈的为对方服务的意识（an intense notion of being of service）, 并且希望在彼此身上找到价值（to find value in their partners）, 同时共同努力完成目标（to work with their partner to reach a common goal）. 这种爱一般也是最为长久并且稳固的。



7.腓利塔之爱 Philautia love

Philautia love也叫作self-love, 也就是自我之爱。起初这种爱被看作是一种品格上的缺陷（a moral flaw）, 类比于虚荣（vanity）和自私（selfishness）. 在韦伯斯特词典中，Philautia love被定义为“只考虑自己的开心和利益”（to regard for one's own happiness or advantage）. 

但是随着时代发展，Philautia love开始有了更多积极的意义（throughout the centuries this definition has adopted a more positive connotation）, 比如在嬉皮时代（the Hippie era）, 人们开始弘扬这种自我之爱；以及新时代的女权主义运动在心理健康意识上的提升，也延伸出了对自我之爱的关注。也十分强调自我之爱在增进心理健康中的作用。

As I started up the stairs the concierge knocked on the glass of the door of her lodge, and as I stopped she came out.

She had some letters and a telegram.

"Here is the post. And there was a lady here to see you."

"Did she leave a card?"No. She was with a gentleman.

It was the one who was here last night. In the end I find she is very nice."

"Was she with a friend of mine?"I don't know. He was never here before.

He was very large. Very, very large.She was very nice. Very, very nice.

Last night she was, perhaps, a little--" She put her head on one hand and rocked it up and down.

"I'll speak perfectly frankly, Monsieur Barnes. Last night I found her not so gentille ([法]和蔼可亲). Last night I formed another idea of her.

But listen to what I tell you. She is trés, trés gentille ([法]非常、非常和蔼可亲). She is of very good family. It is a thing you can see."

"They did not leave any word?"Yes. They said they would be back in an hour."

"Send them up when they come."Yes, Monsieur Barnes.

And that lady, that lady there is some one. An eccentric, perhaps, but quelqu'une, quelqu'une ([法]高贵人物，高贵人物)!"

The only trouble was that people who did not fall into any of those three categories were very liable to be told there was no one home, chez ([法]在……家里) Barnes.

One of my friends, an extremely underfed-looking painter, who was obviously to Madame Duzinell neither well brought up, of good family, nor a sportsman, wrote me a letter asking if I could get him a pass to get by the concierge so he could come up and see me occasionally in the evenings.

I went up to the flat wondering what Brett had done to the concierge.

The wire was a cable from Bill Gorton, saying he was arriving on the France.

I put the mail on the table, went back to the bedroom, undressed and had a shower.

I was rubbing down when I heard the door-bell pull. I put on a bathrobe and slippers and went to the door.

It was Brett. Back of her was the count. He was holding a great bunch of roses.

"Hello, darling," said Brett. "Aren't you going to let us in?"

"Come on. I was just bathing."

"Aren't you the fortunate man. Bathing."

"Only a shower. Sit down, Count Mippipopolous. What will you drink?"

"I don't know whether you like flowers, sir," the count said, "but I took the liberty of just bringing these roses."

> <font color=red>"I don't know whether you like flowers, sir," the count said, "but I took the liberty ofjust bringing these roses."</font>

"Here, give them to me." Brett took them. "Get me some water in this, Jake."

I filled the big earthenware jug with water in the kitchen, and Brett put the roses in it, and placed them in the centre of the dining-room table.

"I say. We have had a day."You don't remember anything about a date with me at the Crillon?"

"No. Did we have one? I must have been blind."You were quite drunk, my dear," said the count.

"Wasn't I, though? And the count's been a brick, absolutely."

"I ought to have. Gave her two hundred francs."

"Don't be a damned fool."His," she said, and nodded at the count.

"I thought we ought to give her a little something for last night. It was very late."

"He's wonderful," Brett said. "He remembers everything that's happened."

"So do you, my dear."Fancy," said Brett. "Who'd want to? I say, Jake, do we get a drink?"

"You get it while I go in and dress. You know where it is."Rather."

While I dressed I heard Brett put down glasses and then a siphon, and then heard them talking.

I dressed slowly, sitting on the bed. I felt tired and pretty rotten.

Brett came in the room, a glass in her hand, and sat on the bed.

"What's the matter, darling? Do you feel rocky?"

She kissed me coolly on the forehead.

"Oh, Brett, I love you so much."

"Darling," she said. Then: "Do you want me to send him away?"

"No. He's nice."I'll send him away."

"No, don't."Yes, I'll send him away."

"You can't just like that."Can't I, though? You stay here. He's mad about me, I tell you."

She was gone out of the room. I layface down on the bed.

I was having a bad time. I heard them talking but I did not listen.

Brett came in and sat on the bed."Poor old darling." She stroked my head.

"What did you say to him?" I was lying with my face away from her. I did not want to see her.

"Sent him for champagne. He loves to go for champagne."

Then later: "Do you feel better, darling? Is the head any better?"

"It's better."Lie quiet. He's gone to the other side of town."

"Couldn't we live together, Brett? Couldn't we just live together?"

"I don't think so. I'd just tromper ([法]欺骗，对……不忠) you with everybody. You couldn't stand it."

"I stand it now."That would be different. It's my fault, Jake. It's the way I'm made."

"Couldn't we go off in the country for a while?"

"It wouldn't be any good. I'll go if you like.

But I couldn't live quietly in the country. Not with my own true love."

"I know."Isn't it rotten? There isn't any use my telling you I love you."

"You know I love you."Let's not talk.Talking's all bilge. I'm going away from you, and then Michael's coming back."

"Why are you going away?"Better for you. Better for me."

"When are you going?"Soon as I can."

"Where?"San Sebastian."

"Can't we go together?"No. That would be a hell of an idea after we'd just talked it out."

"We never agreed."Oh, you know as well as I do. Don't be obstinate, darling."

"Oh, sure," I said. "I know you're right. I'm just low, and when I'm low I talk like a fool."

I sat up, leaned over, found my shoes beside the bed and put them on. I stood up.

"Don't look like that, darling."How do you want me to look?"

"Oh, don't be a fool. I'm going away to-morrow."To-morrow?"

"Yes. Didn't I say so? I am."Let's have a drink, then. The count will be back."

"Yes. He should be back. You know he's extraordinary about buying champagne. It means any amount to him."

We went into the dining-room. I tookup the brandy bottle and poured Brett a drink and one for myself.

There was a ring at the bell-pull. I went to the door and there was the count.

Behind him was the chauffeur carrying a basket of champagne.

"Where should I have him put it, sir?" asked the count.

"In the kitchen," Brett said."Put it in there, Henry," the count motioned.

"Now go down and get the ice." He stood looking after the basket inside the kitchen door.

"I think you'll find that's very good wine," he said.

"I know we don't get much of a chance to judge good wine in the States now, but I got this from a friend of mine that's in the business."

"Oh, you always have some one in the trade," Brett said.

"This fellow raises the grapes. He's got thousands of acres of them."

"What's his name?" asked Brett. "Veuve Cliquot?"

"No," said the count. "Mumms. He's a baron."

"Isn't it wonderful," said Brett. "We all have titles. Why haven't you a title, Jake?"

"I assure you, sir," the count put his hand on my arm. "It never does a man any good. Most of the time it costs you money."

"Oh, I don't know. It's damned useful sometimes," Brett said.

"I've never known it to do me any good."You haven't used it properly. I've had hell's own amount of credit on mine."

"Do sit down, count," I said. "Let me take that stick."

The count was looking at Brett across the table under the gaslight.

She was smoking a cigarette and flicking the ashes on the rug.

> ==flick英 [flɪk] 美 [flɪk] v. 轻弹，轻击；轻拂；忽然摇动 n. 电影；轻弹，轻拂；==

She saw me notice it. "I say, Jake, Idon't want to ruin your rugs. Can't you give a chap an ash-tray?"

I found some ash-trays and spread them around. The chauffeur came up with a bucket full of salted ice.

"Put two bottles in it, Henry," the count called."Anything else, sir?"No. Wait down in the car."

He turned to Brett and to me. "We'll want to ride out to the Bois for dinner?"

"If you like," Brett said. "I couldn't eat a thing."

"I always like a good meal," said the count.

"Should I bring the wine in, sir?" asked the chauffeur.

"Yes. Bring it in, Henry," said the count. He took out a heavy pigskin cigar-case and offered it to me.

"Like to try a real American cigar?"Thanks," I said. "I'll finish the cigarette."

He cut off the end of his cigar with a gold cutter he wore on one end of his watch-chain.

"I like a cigar to really draw," said the count. "Half the cigars you smoke don't draw."

He lit the cigar, puffed at it, looking across the table at Brett. "And when you're divorced, Lady Ashley, then you won't have a title."

"No. What a pity."No," said the count.

"You don't need a title. You got class all over you."

"Thanks. Awfully decent of you."I'm not joking you," the count blew a cloud of smoke.

"You got the most class of anybody I ever seen. You got it. That's all."

"Nice of you," said Brett. "Mummy would be pleased.

Couldn't you write it out, and I'll send it in a letter to her."

"I'd tell her, too," said the count. "I'm not joking you. I never joke people. Joke people and you make enemies. That's what I always say."

"You're right," Brett said. "You're terribly right.

I always joke people and I haven't a friend in the world. Except Jake here."

"You don't joke him."That's it."

### 背景知识

**💧****San Sebastian 圣塞巴斯蒂安**

Brett告诉Jake自己很快就要和未婚夫Michael（Brett的未婚夫全名为Mike Campbell, Michael是Brett对他的昵称）一起到San Sebastian去了："When are you going?" "Soon as I can." "Where?" "San Sebastian."

San Sebastian其实不在法国境内，而是距其仅20公里的海滨小城，位于西班牙北部的巴斯克自治州（Basque）. 很多人对这个城市的了解可能来自于它所举办的闻名世界的“圣塞巴斯蒂安电影节”（San Sebastian International Film Festival），是除了戛纳、威尼斯和柏林电影节之外的五大国际电影节之一，最高奖项叫作“金贝壳奖”。这个奖项的名称来源于西班牙一处著名的度假胜地——贝壳湾（La Concha Bay ）.

它因形状像扇贝而得名，海湾中央的一座岩石就如同贝壳中的明珠。它的名声大噪据说是因为当伊丽莎白一世女王生病时，医生建议她洗海水浴，她就选择了贝壳湾疗养，果然很快痊愈。由此大量游客慕名而来，贝壳湾也渐渐成为了欧洲人的度假胜地。

此外San Sebastian因为背山靠海获取食材便利等天然优势，加上悠久的饮食文化，成为了全世界人均米其林星第二多的城市（第一是京都）；而且它几乎可以算是整个欧洲的料理重镇，还专门设有提供料理学文凭的料理中心（Basque Culinary Center）.

这里想要为大家介绍的是西班牙一种传统的平民小吃——Pintxos. 这个词语本身是指插食物用的牙签， 最开始是酒馆为了方便，事先把烧好的食物用木签串起来，等到客人点的时候再进行加热。当然现在这种店面都是让客人现点，然后再现串现烧，牙签就变成只是形式了。

最简单的Pintxos一般就是一片面包和几片肉，再捎带一根香肠或者一个煎蛋，末了再串上一根小青辣椒，便捷又美味。

### 课文理解

自Brett失约没有在酒店出现后，她竟然带着伯爵一起到了Jake家。趁着把伯爵打发去买香槟的间隙，Brett和Jake有了一次深入的对谈。这也让我们看到了Jake在Brett面前卑微懦弱、吞下自尊和骄傲的一面——

💧**Clue 1**:  Jake really swallows his pride.



**Evidence 1**: "Couldn't we live together, Brett? Couldn't we just live together?"

"I don't think so. I'd just tromper you with everybody. You couldn't stand it."

"I stand it now."

“我们不能在一块过，勃莱特？我们不能就那么住到一起？”

“我看不行。我会见人就搞关系对你不忠实。你会受不了的。”

“我现在不是能受得了吗！”

**Evidence 2**: "Couldn't we go off in the country for a while?"

"It wouldn't be any good. I'll go if you like. But I couldn't live quietly in the country. Not with my own true love."

“我们能不能到乡间去住一阵子？”

“一点好处也没有。如果你喜欢，我就去。不过我在乡间不会安安静静地待着。和我真正心爱的人在一起也不行。”

在Brett的态度无比坚决的情况下，Jake表现出了我们在前面的情节里没有看到的一种铁汉柔情，或者说是卑微。因为生理机能上的残缺，Jake只能容忍自己的心爱之人另觅他欢。这也是这整个故事最大的冲突来源：Jake对Brett痴心不改，但Brett却不能为他放弃自己的花花世界（"It's my fault, Jake. It's the way I'm made."）所以两个人将一直纠缠不明下去。



💧**Clue 2**: Brett is careless and poor in manners.



**Evidence 1**: She was smoking a cigarette and flicking the ashes on the rug. She saw me notice it. "I say, Jake, I don't want to ruin your rugs. Can't you give a chap an ash-tray?"

她在抽烟，往地摊上弹烟灰。她看见我注意到了。“喂，杰克，我不愿意弄脏你的地毯。你不能给我个烟灰缸吗？”

Brett在察觉到Jake非常介意她把烟灰弹到地毯上的时候，才若无其事地问他要烟灰缸，并且一点没有感觉到歉意。这个细节其实是一个讽刺，因为在此之前，三个人刚刚谈到关于“头衔”的话题，并且首先是Brett挑起的（"Isn't it wonderful," said Brett. "We all have titles. Why haven't you a title, Jake?"）。

但Brett的头衔只不过是因为她的丈夫的爵位身份，所以伯爵提醒她一旦离婚，她的头衔就没有了（"And when you're divorced, Lady Ashley, then you won't have a title"）. 此外，头衔对于Brett来说也只是多了一个便利（"Oh, I don't know. It's damned useful sometimes," Brett said.）和身份教养都无关，这在一定程度上也体现出了她的虚荣心。

反而是Jake这个没有头衔的人，在伯爵看来却是他见过的人当中最有高贵优雅气质的（"I'm not joking you," the count blew a cloud of smoke. "You got the most class of anybody I ever seen. You got it. That's all."）联系我们之前提到过的海明威对上层阶级抱着天然的敌意和鄙夷，也就不难理解他在这里借着笔下的角色嘲讽了一番。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****English idioms from horse racing**

**源自马术的英语俚语**

在欧洲有一句古老流传的谚语：“会骑马的不一定是贵族，但贵族一定会骑马”。马术在欧洲是一项有着悠久历史的贵族运动，而现代马术其实起源于英国，16世纪传入欧洲。所以马术的传统和文化也对英语表达影响深远。今天的彩蛋我们一起来看一看来源于马术的英语俚语都有哪些~



\1. Dead heat

胜负不分

这个短语可不能按照字面理解为“very hot”. 在早期英国赛马中，个人赛一般被称作“heats”. 所以如果双方同时到达了终点，裁判就会宣布“dead”, 并且这一轮成绩无效（dead这个词在体育运动中使用很多哦~比如它还可以指“球落到界外”，The ball is dead.）

但是在今天的马术比赛中，出现胜负不分的情况时，双方都可以同时赢得比赛（both horses pay off as winners）, 所以实际上已经不是dead了。

dead heat现在不仅限于在马术比赛中使用，其他的体育运动或者是政治选举都会用到这个表达，也就是指“势均力敌，不相上下”（a situation during a race or competition, etc. when two or more people are at the same level）, 比如：

The two candidates are in a dead heat in the polls.

两名候选人在民意测验中势均力敌。



\2. Across the board

全部包括在内

across the board在马术里是押注的一种形式。最基本的马票有三种：Win, Place, Show.

Win 是要选定的赛马获得第一名才能得到赌注；

Place 是获得第一名或第二名皆可得到赌注（但赌金会比上一种少）；

Show 也就是获得第一、二或三即可得到赌注（同理，因为风险最低，所以赌金也是三种当中最少的）。

而across the board就是三张马票都一起买了，如果这匹马获得了第一名，那么投注者就可以兑现这三张彩票的赌注（When a horse is bet across the board, in the event of a win the bettor will cash all three tickets）.

所以我们今天用across the board的时候就是指“全面地，涉及全员地”（something applies to everything or everyone in a set）. 比如：

The changes will affect local authoritiesacross the board.

这些变化将涉及所有的地方政府。

We find jobs for people right across the board, from chief executives to cleaners.

我们为各行各业人士寻找工作，从行政主管到清洁人员无所不包。



\3. Hands down

轻而易举

用Hands down来形容一个人赢得比赛或是选举的时候，其实就是在指非常轻而易举、唾手可得（to win easily and without any trouble）.

在马术比赛当中，如果一匹马从一出发就摇摇领先（when a horse pulls out to so commanding of a lead）, 那么骑师就不需要再挥鞭策马（then a jockey doesn't need to go to a whip, or do anything at all）, 只管骑在上面等着冲破终点线。

这时候大家就会说The jockey won hands down.（骑师的手啥也没干，全靠马自己在跑：He or she puts their hands down and lets the horse do all the work coming home.）

所以hands down就表示easily and decisively; without question. 我们再来看几个例句：

He won the election hands down. 

他轻易地当选了。

We were really unprepared for our last game, and the other team won hands down.

我们没有好好准备决赛，结果别的队伍毫无悬念地赢了比赛。

另外hands down在口语里也非常好用哦~当我们想表示“毫无疑问，绝对”的时候，hands down就可以用来替换definitely或者exactly, 比如：

This is the best pie I've ever had, hands down!

这是我吃过的最好吃的派！



## Chapter 7.2

"Do you, now?" asked the count. "Do you joke him?"

Brett looked at me and wrinkled up the corners of her eyes.

"No," she said. "I wouldn't joke him."

"See," said the count. "You don't joke him."

"This is a hell of a dull talk," Brett said. "How about some of that champagne?"

The count reached down and twirled the bottles in the shiny bucket.

"It isn't cold, yet. You're always drinking, my dear. Why don't you just talk?"

"I've talked too ruddy much. I've talked myself all out to Jake."

> <font color=red>"I've talked too ruddy much. I've talked myself all out to Jake."</font>
>
> “我已经唠唠叨叨地说得太多了。我跟杰克把什么事都谈透了。”

> **💧表达精讲**

> ①ruddy 在这里是很口语的一个表达，用于加强语气 ，尤其是表示愤怒和不耐烦。比如：
>
> I wish that ruddy dog would stop barking!（我希望那只该死的狗不要再叫了！）
>
> *ruddy是为了避免使用bloody或damn等太过粗俗的词语而延伸而来的一种委婉语（Euphemism）.
>
> ②talk oneself out 字面上的意思是“说到筋疲力尽、再无可说的为止”（to talk until one can talk no more）. 比如：She talked herself out and was silent for the rest of the day.（她一下子把所有要说的都倾倒出来了，所以剩下的时间里她都在沉默。）

"I should like to hear you really talk,my dear. When you talk to me you never finish your sentences at all."

"Leave 'em for you to finish. Let anyone finish them as they like."

"It is a very interesting system," the count reached down and gave the bottles a twirl. "Still I would like to hear you talk some time."

"Isn't he a fool?" Brett asked."Now," the count brought up a bottle. "I think this is cool."

I brought a towel and he wiped the bottle dry and held it up.

"I like to drink champagne from magnums. The wine is better but it would have been too hard to cool."

He held the bottle, looking at it. I put out the glasses.

"I say. You might open it," Brett suggested."Yes, my dear. Now I'll open it."

It was amazing champagne.

"I say that is wine," Brett held up her glass. "We ought to toast something. 'Here's to royalty.'"

"This wine is too good for toast-drinking, my dear. You don't want to mix emotions up with a wine like that. You lose the taste."

Brett's glass was empty."You ought to write a book on wines, count," I said.

"Mr. Barnes," answered the count, "all I want out of wines is to enjoy them."

"Let's enjoy a little more of this," Brett pushed her glass forward.

The count poured very carefully. "There, my dear. Now you enjoy that slowly, and then you can get drunk."

"Drunk? Drunk?"My dear, you are charming when you are drunk."Listen to the man."

"Mr. Barnes," the count poured my glass full. "She is the only lady I have ever known who was as charming when she was drunk as when she was sober."

"You haven't been around much, have you?"

"Yes, my dear. I have been around very much. I have been around a very great deal."

"Drink your wine," said Brett. "We've all been around. I dare say Jake here has seen as much as you have."

"My dear, I am sure Mr. Barnes has seen a lot. Don't think I don't think so, sir. I have seen a lot, too."

"Of course you have, my dear," Brett said. "I was only ragging."

"I have been in seven wars and four revolutions," the count said.

"Soldiering?" Brett asked."Sometimes, my dear.

And I have got arrow wounds. Have you ever seen arrow wounds?"Let's have a look at them."

The count stood up, unbuttoned his vest, and opened his shirt.

He pulled up the undershirt onto his chest and stood, his chest black, and big stomach muscles bulging under the light.

>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> bulge 原义是“膨胀，鼓起”，这里stomach muscles bulging形容肚子鼓起来就是“大腹便便”的样子，也可以说one's belly bulges.
>
> 另外bulge还延伸出了“骤增”的意思，一般作名词，比如：The baby boom created a bulge in school enrollment.（婴儿潮导致入学人数骤增。）

"You see them?"Below the line where his ribs stopped were two raised white welts.

"See on the back where they come out." Above the small of the back were the same two scars, raised as thick as a finger.

"I say. Those are something."Clean through."

The count was tucking in his shirt.

"Where did you get those?" I asked."In Abyssinia. When I was twenty-one years old."

"What were you doing?" asked Brett. "Were you in the army?"

"I was on a business trip, my dear."

"I told you he was one of us. Didn't I?" Brett turned to me. "I love you, count. You're a darling."

"You make me very happy, my dear. But it isn't true."

"Don't be an ass."You see, Mr. Barnes, it is because I have lived very much that now I can enjoy everything so well.Don't you find it like that?"

"Yes. Absolutely."I know," said the count. "That is the secret. You must get to know the values."

"Doesn't anything ever happen to your values?" Brett asked.

"No. Not any more."Never fall in love?"

"Always," said the count. "I am always in love."

"What does that do to your values?"That, too, has got a place in my values."

"You haven't any values. You're dead, that's all."No, my dear. You're not right. I'm not dead at all."

We drank three bottles of the champagne and the count left the basket in my kitchen.

We dined at a restaurant in the Bois. It was a good dinner.

Food had an excellent place in the count's values. So did wine.

> <font color=red>Food had an excellent place in the count's values.</font>

>
> ②values 表示“价值观念”（the moral principles and beliefs that one thinks is important）. 比如： The countries of South Asia also share many common values.（南亚各国也有许多共同的价值观念。）

The count was in fine form during the meal. So was Brett. It was a good party.

"Where would you like to go?" asked the count after dinner.

We were the only people left in the restaurant. The two waiters were standing over against the door. They wanted to go home.

"We might go up on the hill," Brett said. "Haven't we had a splendid party?"

The count was beaming. He was very happy.

> ==beam英 [bi:m] 美 [bim] n. 束;梁，栋梁;光线;（电波的）波束 vi. 发出光与热;面露喜色==

"You are very nice people," he said.He was smoking a cigar again.

"Why don't you get married, you two?"

"We want to lead our own lives," I said.

"We have our careers," Brett said. "Come on. Let's get out of this."

"Have another brandy," the count said.

"Get it on the hill."No. Have it here where it is quiet."

"You and your quiet," said Brett. "What is it men feel about quiet?"

"We like it," said the count. "Like you like noise, my dear."

"All right," said Brett. "Let's have one."

"Sommelier!" the count called."Yes, sir."

"What is the oldest brandy you have?"Eighteen eleven, sir."

"Bring us a bottle."I say. Don't be ostentatious. Call him off, Jake."

"Got many antiquities?"I got a houseful."

Finally we went up to Montmartre (蒙马特). Inside Zelli's it was crowded, smoky, and noisy.

The music hit you as you went in. Brett and I danced. It was so crowded we could barely move.

The nigger drummer waved at Brett.We were caught in the jam, dancingin one place in front of him.

"Hahre you?"Great."Thaats good."He was all teeth and lips.

"He's a great friend of mine," Brett said. "Damn good drummer."

The music stopped and we started toward the table where the count sat.Then the music started again and we danced.

I looked at the count. He was sitting at the table smoking a cigar. The music stopped again.

"Let's go over."Brett started toward the table.

The music started and again we danced, tight in the crowd.

"You are a rotten dancer, Jake. Michael's the best dancer I know."

"He's splendid."He's got his points."

"I like him," I said. "I'm damned fond of him."

"I'm going to marry him," Brett said. "Funny. I haven't thought about him for a week."

"Don't you write him?"Not I. Never write letters."

"I'll bet he writes to you."Rather. Damned good letters, too."

"When are you going to get married?"How do I know? As soon as we can get the divorce. Michael's trying to get his mother to put up for it."

> <font color=red>"How do I know? As soon as we can get the divorce. Michael's trying to get his mother to put up for it."</font>

"Could I help you?"Don't be an ass. Michael's people have loads of money."

The music stopped. We walked over to the table. The count stood up.

"Very nice," he said. "You looked very, very nice."

"Don't you dance, count?" I asked."No. I'm too old."

"Oh, come off it," Brett said."My dear, I would do it if I would enjoy it. I enjoy to watch you dance."

"Splendid," Brett said. "I'll dance again for you some time. I say. What about your little friend, Zizi?"

"Let me tell you. I support that boy, but I don't want to have him around."

"He is rather hard."You know I think that boy's got a future. But personally I don't want him around."

"Jake's rather the same way."He gives me the willys."

"Well," the count shrugged his shoulders. "About his future you can't ever tell. Anyhow, his father was a great friend of my father."

"Come on. Let's dance," Brett said.We danced. It was crowded and close.

"Oh, darling," Brett said, "I'm so miserable."

I had that feeling of going through something that has all happened before.

"Want to go?"I had the feeling as in a nightmare of it all being something repeated, something I had been through and that now I must go through again.

". . . . . ." the drummer sang softly."Let's go," said Brett. "You don't mind."

". . . . . ." the drummer shouted and grinned at Brett.

"All right," I said. We got out from the crowd. Brett went to the dressing-room.

"Brett wants to go," I said to the count.

He nodded. "Does she? That's fine. You take the car. I'm going to stay here for a while, Mr. Barnes."

We shook hands."It was a wonderful time," I said. "I wish you would let me get this." I took a note out of my pocket.

"Mr. Barnes, don't be ridiculous," the count said.

Brett came over with her wrap on. She kissed the count and put her hand on his shoulder to keep him from standing up.

As we went out the door I looked back and there were three girls at his table. We got into the big car. Brett gave the chauffeur the address of her hotel.

"No, don't come up," she said at the hotel. She had rung and the door was unlatched.

> ==unlatch英 ['ʌn'lætʃ] 美 [ʌn'lætʃ] v. 拔掉门栓，未栓上==

"Really?"No. Please."Good night, Brett," I said. "I'm sorry you feel rotten."

"Good night, Jake. Good night, darling. I won't see you again." We kissed standing at the door.

She pushed me away. We kissed again. "Oh, don't!" Brett said.

She turned quickly and went into the hotel. The chauffeur drove me around to my flat.

I gave him twenty francs and he touched his cap and said: "Good night, sir," and drove off.

I rang the bell. The door opened and I went up-stairs and went to bed.

### 背景知识

**💧****Bois de Boulogne 布洛涅森林**

Jake、Brett和伯爵三人一起在布洛涅森林的一家餐厅吃了晚饭（We dined at a restaurant in the Bois）. 这片森林坐落在巴黎城西，跟巴黎东南的文森森林（Bois de Vincennes）一起被视为巴黎吸收氧气的两扇“肺叶”。它的西边是向北流的塞纳河，东边是巴黎的富人区——十六区（16th arrondissement），北临最富庶的塞纳河畔讷伊（Neuilly sur Seine），南靠布洛涅-比扬古（Boulogne Billancourt）.

布洛涅森林原本属于皇家林苑，国王陛下常在这里狩猎。拿破仑三世（Napoleon III ）执政的时候，便请建筑师精心规划，随后，秉承国王的意旨，按陛下的喜欢，以伦敦的海德公园（Hyde park）为蓝本，增设了林荫大道和人工湖泊。

后来，宫廷里的很多大型活动都挪到这里举行，贵宾们吃喝玩乐的要求越来越高，于是只能花钱买脸，逐步修建了动物园、游乐场、赛马场、足球场等娱乐设施。名声日隆，地盘益大，直到“布洛涅”发育成一个鸟语花香，浓荫遍地的休闲娱乐场所。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/642eb7efe5cb096cfbbbe2f6ba1bbf84-sz_417990.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)

（充满异域风情的动植物园）



在贵族渐渐式微后，涌入布洛涅森林的另一批“客人”则多是商界或文艺界的名流，包括那些取得战功的军官，赚了大钱的富商、大亨、银行家，以及声明鹊起的社会名流和艺术家。再比如，著名作家海明威、萨特，以及著名的时装设计师夏奈尔等人。

布洛涅森林也是许多虚构文学作品中的背景场所，比如小仲马的《茶花女》、司汤达的《红与黑》、左拉的《娜娜》、巴尔扎克的《交际花盛衰记》等多部小说中，男女主人公都曾在布洛涅森林中散步幽会、谈情说爱。

普鲁斯特在童年的时候，整日在布洛涅森林中的湖畔散步，在《追忆似水年华》第一卷中，他如此地描写了布洛涅森林：

在我心目中，这林园仿佛就是一座座这样的动物园——各色草木无不具备，种种景色层出不穷，翻过小山就看到洞窟、草原、山岩、河流、沟壑、小丘、沼泽……

布洛涅林园，也是十分复杂，集结着许多自成体系的小世界。此外还有万千细节，我都寄予充分的信任，仿佛给这些转瞬即逝、游移不定的东西注入一个灵魂，使它们取得一件艺术杰作的完整一致。

但布洛涅森林在以高贵优雅的休憩之所闻名的同时，也因为夜晚的灯红酒绿以及荒淫放荡而臭名昭著。所以它在某种层面上也成为了巴黎这座城市本身的一个缩影。

### 课文理解

在前面的内容里，我们一直是从当事人Jake和Brett的角度来审视他们的关系，比如虽然总体来看，两个人是彼此相爱的，但双方的实际需求产生了落差（Jake无法在性上满足Brett），由此也形成了不可戳破的隔膜。而今天的内容里，作者从第三者 ，也就是伯爵的视角展现了这段关系在旁人眼中是什么样子。我们会发现的是，在别人看来，Jake和Brett是天生注定的一对——

💧**Clue 1**:  Jake and Brett are meant for each other.

**Evidence 1**: "I've talked too ruddy much. I've talked myself all out to Jake."

"I should like to hear you really talk, my dear. When you talk to me you never finish your sentences at all."

“我已经唠唠叨叨地说得太多了。我跟杰克把什么事都谈透了。”

“我真想听你好好地说说话，亲爱的。你跟我说话老是说半句留半句。”



**Evidence 2**: "You are very nice people," he said. He was smoking a cigar again. "Why don't you get married, you two?"

“你们俩都非常好 ，”他说。他又抽起雪茄来。“你们为什么不结婚，你们俩？”



首先伯爵的第一段话暗示了Brett和Jake在一起更能侃侃而谈，这一点已经令他感觉嫉妒了。虽然Brett嘴上对伯爵的称呼非常亲昵（darling），但实际上她跟伯爵却没有过多的亲近，比如她会为了和Jake单独说话而把伯爵打发走。所以在伯爵看来，他们俩就是应该结婚的关系。

其次伯爵这个人物的设定也有一定的深意。他的年龄可以算是这一群年轻人里面最大的，两个细节可以看出来：一是他提到自己参加过的战争和革命的次数（"I have been in seven wars and four revolutions," the count said）; 另一个是他在舞厅里的表现（"Don't you dance, count?" I asked. "No. I'm too old." "Oh, come off it," Brett said. "My dear, I would do it if I would enjoy it. I enjoy to watch you dance."）

由此伯爵的视角也是更为成熟并且富有经验的，可以为读者提供一个贴近客观的参考。因为我们的叙述者也是故事的参与者，所以无法独立于情节之外，塑造一个长者的形象就可以起到弥补的作用，当然我们也可以把他看成作者自己在故事里化身。

说到这里，我们要再提到作者是如何通过对伯爵的生活态度等方面的刻画来传递自己的价值观，这也是之前简单介绍过的，在海明威看来：只靠读书来认识世界的生活是无益甚至有害——

💧**Clue 2**: Truely living life is important than just reading about it in books.



**Evidence 1**: "You ought to write a book on wines, count," I said.

"Mr. Barnes," answered the count, "all I want out of wines is to enjoy them."

“你应该写一本论酒的专著，伯爵，”我说。

“巴恩斯先生，”伯爵回答，“我喝酒的唯一乐趣就是品味。”



**Evidence 2**: "You see, Mr. Barnes, it is because I have lived very much that now I can enjoy everything so well. Don't you find it like that?"

“你瞧，巴恩斯先生，正因为我经历坎坷，所以今天才能尽情享乐。你是否也是这么看的？”



当Jake提议伯爵应该写书时，伯爵的回答是喝酒的时候享受酒的美味才是重要的，而不是为了写一本论著而去喝酒。这里其实是在映射Cohn，这位才露头角的新兴作家。比较讽刺的是在上一章的内容里 ，Cohn离开Frances的借口就是巴黎的生活太无趣以致于才思枯竭，所以他要离开去其他地方寻找写作素材。

Cohn在某种程度上很沉迷于写作这件事，但他的缺点也正在于他对写作的执着超过了生活本身。书作为对想象的延伸和知识的拓展本无可厚非，但作者在这里想强调的是生活最本质的快乐并不是从知识而来的，而是实际的体验。

另一方面，Cohn的这种迷惘和无切实际其实也是一战后青年的普遍精神状态——无法在现实里找到生活的根基，只能在书本或是其他可能的想象世界里寻找答案，这也造成了他们极度的空虚和游离。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧在蒙马特一定不能错过的风景**

蒙马特高地（Montmartre）在这本小说里也是主角们经常活动的地方之一，比如在稍前的内容里，Jake和Brett借口从舞厅脱身的时候就说他们要去蒙马特约会（"We're going," Brett said. "We've a date up at Montmartre"）, 以及今天的内容里Jake, Brett和伯爵三个人也一起去了蒙马特的一间咖啡馆（Finally we went up to Montmartre. Inside Zelli's it was crowded, smoky, and noisy）. 

蒙马特可以算是巴黎景点最密集的一个区。它本身是一片高地，相对巴黎其他部分的地势都很高，所以塞纳河也无法逆流而上经过这里。但这里却孕育出了极为浓厚的宗教、艺术和浪漫氛围，每一处都是风景和故事。所以今天的彩蛋我们就来看看在蒙马特有哪些不容错过的风景吧~



\1. 小丘广场（Place du Tertre）

在蒙马特高地还是巴黎近郊一个小村庄的时候，小丘广场就已是人们欢聚消遣的集会场所，现如今则成了一个画家和艺术家的聚集地。广场大致位于蒙马特区的中心位置，紧邻圣彼埃尔教堂和圣心大教堂。 十九世纪末的著名画家如保罗高更、卢梭、雷诺瓦、毕加索、布拉克等都曾在此为生计作画。



\2. 红磨坊（Moulin Rouge）

红磨坊的祝兴歌舞节目取得巨大成功得益于1870年普法战争后，曾因战事过度操劳的人们需要寻找一个放松的地方，于是酒吧和歌舞厅就成了当时人们的首选。红磨坊于1889年起建，很快就成为了人们寻找另类相遇的情色场所，更成为艺术家们寻找灵感和相互结识的地方。

它之所以举世闻名，原因之一是画坛怪杰亨 利·图卢兹-劳特瑞克（Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec）以歌舞厅为题材创作了一系列名画，二则是这里上演的著名法国“康康舞（Cancan）”现今几乎被世界各国视为了法国的“民族舞蹈”。



\3. 狡兔酒吧（Le lapin agile）

这间酒吧可以说是巴黎有名的娱乐场所中最古老的一家了。 “狡兔”这个奇怪的名字来自于画家安德雷·吉乐（André Gill）的一幅奇特的画，画中一只人性化的兔子从一只平底锅中跳出，从此这只兔子就与这个酒吧结合在了一起。最初这间酒吧叫“吉乐的兔子（le lapin à Gill）”，随后又被改为现在的用名“狡兔”。

酒吧老板弗雷德（Frédé）爱好艺术，甚至他自己也进行一些艺术创作。当时酒吧的常客如果没有钱或者不想付钱，可以用一张自己的画代替酒钱来付帐。这样弗雷德就收集了 许多著名画家未成名前的作品，其中包括了毕加索等人的作品。



\4. 爱墙（Le mur des je t’aime）

爱墙就在蒙马特半山腰上的一个街头小公园里。公园是一个巴黎街头随处可见的那种公众休憩场所，墙也是一面不是特别高大厚重的普通石墙，但是 墙上却有用311种语言和方言的手写笔迹的“我爱你”：je t'aime（法语）, ti amo（意大利语）, ich liebe dich（德语）…… 在墙的上方还有一幅漫画，画中女郎身穿深蓝色吊带裙，斜倚在一张小桌旁，画旁边一行小字写道：“保持理智，勿要强求（soyons raisonnable, exigeons l'impossible）”

爱墙的发起者弗雷德里克·巴隆（Frédéric Baron）是法国一位以写爱情歌曲见长的音乐家，从1992年他开始收集和记录下了1000多条用 300多种语言写就的“我爱你”的手写体，并于1998年就此撰写了一本书，成功发行5万册。巴隆早期的爱情歌曲都是在他居住在蒙马特高地时写下的，因此 他选择这里作为爱墙的归宿。

大家可能注意到了在白字中间还有很多小的红色色块。据说这些色块喻义破碎的心，作者期冀用纯洁和美好的爱来重新弥合这颗散落在爱中的已碎的心。在 2001年情人节举行的爱墙落成仪式上，有100只白鸽展翅飞向蓝天，所要表达的就是人们对和平与爱的渴望。

蒙马特既有巴黎的温柔浪漫，又脱离了喧嚣浮华，如果有机会去巴黎游玩，一定不要错过这一片别有韵味的风景！

I did not see Brett again until she came back from San Sebastian.

One card came from her from there.

It had a picture of the Concha (贝壳湾), and said: "Darling. Very quiet and healthy. Love to all the chaps. BRETT."

Nor did I see Robert Cohn again. I heard Frances had left for England and I had a note from Cohn saying he was going out in the country for a couple of weeks, he did not know where,

but that he wanted to hold me to the fishing-trip in Spain we had talked about last winter.

I could reach him always, he wrote, through his bankers.

Brett was gone, I was not bothered by Cohn's troubles, I rather enjoyed not having to play tennis,

there was plenty of work to do, I went often to the races, dined with friends, and put in some extra time at the office getting things ahead so I could leave it in charge of my secretary when Bill Gorton and I should shove off to Spain the end of June.

Bill Gorton arrived, put up a couple of days at the flat and went off to Vienna.

He was very cheerful and said the States were wonderful. New York was wonderful.

There had been a grand theatrical season and a whole crop of great young light heavy weights.

Any one of them was a good prospect to grow up, put on weight and trim Dempsey.

Bill was very happy. He had made a lot of money on his last book, and was going to make a lot more.

We had a good time while he was in Paris, and then he went off to Vienna.

He was coming back in three weeks and we would leave for Spain to get in some fishing and go to the fiesta at Pamplona (潘普洛纳，位于西班牙).

> ==fiesta英 [fiˈestə] 美 [fɪ'estə] n. <西>（尤指西班牙和南美的）宗教狂欢节日==

He wrote that Vienna (维也纳，奥地利首都) was wonderful. Then a card from Budapest (布达佩斯，匈牙利首都): "Jake, Budapest is wonderful."

Then I got a wire: "Back on Monday."Monday evening he turned up at the flat.

I heard his taxi stop and went to the window and called to him; he waved and started up-stairs carrying his bags.

I met him on the stairs, and took one of the bags."Well," I said, "I hear you had a wonderful trip."

"Wonderful," he said. "Budapest is absolutely wonderful."

"How about Vienna?"Not so good, Jake. Not so good. It seemed better than it was."

"How do you mean?" I was getting glasses and a siphon.

"Tight, Jake. I was tight."That's strange. Better have a drink."

Bill rubbed his forehead. "Remarkable thing," he said. "Don't know how it happened. Suddenly it happened."

"Last long?"Four days, Jake. Lasted just four days."

"Where did you go?"Don't remember. Wrote you a post-card. Remember that perfectly."

"Do anything else?"Not so sure. Possible."

"Go on. Tell me about it."Can't remember. Tell you anything I could remember."

"Go on. Take that drink and remember."Might remember a little," Bill said.

"Remember something about a prize-fight. Enormous Vienna prize-fight. Had a nigger in it. Remember the nigger perfectly."

"Go on."Wonderful nigger. Looked like Tiger Flowers, only four times as big.

All of a sudden everybody started to throw things. Not me. Nigger'd just knocked local boy down. Nigger put up his glove. Wanted to make a speech.

Awful noble-looking nigger. Started to make a speech. Then local white boy hit him. Then he knocked white boy cold. Then everybody commenced to throw chairs.

Nigger went home with us in our car. Couldn't get his clothes. Wore my coat. Remember the whole thing now. Big sporting evening."

"What happened?"Loaned the nigger some clothes and went around with him to try and get his money.

"Probably it wasn't you."You're right.Wasn't me at all. Was another fellow.

Think we called him the local Harvard man. Remember him now. Studying music."

"What became of the nigger?"Went back to Cologne (科隆，位于德国). Lives there. Married. Got a family.

Going to write me a letter and send me the money I loaned him. Wonderful nigger. Hope I gave him the right address."

"You probably did."Well, anyway, let's eat," said Bill. "Unless you want me to tell you some more travel stories."

"Go on."Let's eat."We went down-stairs and out onto the Boulevard St. Michel in the warm June evening.

"Where will we go?"Want to eat on the island?"Sure."

We walked down the Boulevard. At the juncture of the Rue Denfert-Rochereau (丹费尔-罗什洛大街) with the Boulevard is a statue of two men in flowing robes.

"Come on."Just one stuffed dog. I can take 'em or leave 'em alone. But listen, Jake. Just one stuffed dog."

"Come on."Mean everything in the world to you after you bought it. Simple exchange of values. You give them money. They give you a stuffed dog."

"We'll get one on the way back."All right. Have it your own way. Road to hell paved with unbought stuffed dogs. Not my fault."

We went on."How'd you feel that way about dogs so sudden?"

"Always felt that way about dogs. Always been a great lover of stuffed animals."

We stopped and had a drink."Certainly like to drink," Bill said. "You ought to try it some times, Jake."

"You're about a hundred and forty-four ahead of me."

"Where were you drinking?"Stopped at the Crillon. George made me a couple of Jack Roses.

George's a great man. Know the secret of his success? Never been daunted."

"You'll be daunted after about three more pernods."

"Not in public. If I begin to feel daunted I'll go off by myself. I'm like a cat that way."

"When did you see Harvey Stone?"At the Crillon. Harvey was just a little daunted.

Hadn't eaten for three days. Doesn't eat any more. Just goes off like a cat. Pretty sad."

"He's all right."Splendid. Wish he wouldn't keep going off like a cat, though. Makes me nervous."

"What'll we do to-night?"Doesn't make any difference. Only let's not get daunted.

Suppose they got any hard-boiled eggs here? If they had hard-boiled eggs here we wouldn't have to go all the way down to the island to eat."

"Nix," I said. "We're going to have a regular meal."

"Just a suggestion," said Bill. "Want to start now?"

"Come on."We started on again down the Boulevard. A horse-cab passed us. Bill looked at it.

"See that horse-cab? Going to have that horse-cab stuffed for you for Christmas. Going to give all my friends stuffed animals. I'm a nature-writer."

A taxi passed, some one in it waved, then banged for the driver to stop. The taxi backed up to the curb. In it was Brett.

"Beautiful lady," said Bill. "Going to kidnap us."

"Hullo!" Brett said. "Hullo!"This is BillGorton. Lady Ashley."

Brett smiled at Bill. "I say I'm just back. Haven't bathed even. Michael comes in to-night."

"Good. Come on and eat with us, and we'll all go to meet him."

"Must clean myself."Oh, rot! Come on."

"Must bathe. He doesn't get in till nine."

"Come and have a drink, then, before you bathe."

"Might do that. Now you're not talking rot."

We got in the taxi. The driver looked around."Stop at the nearest bistro," I said.

"We might as well go to the Closerie (Closerie des Lilas, 丁香园咖啡馆)," Brett said. "I can't drink these rotten brandies."

"Closerie des Lilas."Brett turned to Bill.

"Have you been in this pestilential city long?"Just got in to-day from Budapest."

"How was Budapest?"Wonderful. Budapest was wonderful."

"Ask him about Vienna."Vienna," said Bill, "is a strange city."

"Very much like Paris," Brett smiled at him, wrinkling the corners of her eyes.

"Exactly," Bill said. "Very much like Paris at this moment."

"You have a good start."Sitting out on the terraces of the Lilas Brett ordered a whiskey and soda, I took one, too, and Bill took another pernod.

### 背景知识

**💧****潘普洛纳的奔牛节**

He was coming back in three weeks and we would leave for Spain to get in some fishing and go to the fiesta at Pamplona.（他将于三周后回来，那时我们将动身到西班牙去钓鱼，然后去潘普洛纳过节。）

大家可能会好奇，Jake和Bill即将一起去西班牙参加的狂欢节到底是什么呢？今天的背景我们就来了解一下潘普洛纳这座城市。以及在这里庆祝的一年一度的节日——奔牛节（正式名称为圣费尔明节）。

潘普洛纳（Pamplona）在西班牙东北部，在公元1000年还是纳瓦拉王国都城，因此也有许多古城墙、 堡垒及15世纪的哥特式大教堂。1841年卡尔里斯特战争后，才改为纳瓦拉自治区的首府（the capital city of the Autonomous Community of Navarre）.

（潘普洛纳大教堂）



它位于阿尔加河西岸肥沃的农业区中，潘普洛纳位于阿尔加河西岸肥沃的农业区中，周围盛产小麦、葡萄、蔬菜等。有食品、陶瓷、机器、造纸等工业，并且以手工制造酒囊和凉鞋著名。

而我们的主人公们要去参加的节日也就是“圣费尔明节”（San Fermín festival）. 为纪念鞋匠，酿酒师和面点师的守护神——圣徒“圣费尔明”，每年7月6日至14日期间，潘普洛纳都会在街头巷尾举行圣大的庆祝活动。而奔牛（Running of the Bulls）便是节日里最不可获缺少的因素。



在节日的9天里，来自世界各地的人们穿上白衣裤，缠上红腰带，表示参加的意愿。奔牛开始的当天，人们穿着白色衣衫，戴着红色圣费尔明围巾和红腰带，手里拿着卷起的报纸，以便在牛接近的时候驱赶它们。

到8点整时，会有一名老者点燃一支爆竹作为活动的开始。在活动开始前，人们需要向圣费尔明祈祷，祈求其在奔牛中保护自己。接下来，最先放出牛棚的是6只将会出现在下午的斗牛活动中的蛮牛。人和牛将奔跑在820米长的通向斗牛场的青石老街上。

这些牛非常凶悍，有的牛角被磨尖，甚至露出神经，一触既痛，有的牛眼睛被抹上辣椒，以激怒它，引发它的野性。它们的奔跑速度可以达到每小时24公里（每秒6.6米），所以奔跑大约在3到4分钟内就会结束。奔牛节期间，每年都有人受伤，甚至也发生过死亡事件。

这个节日之所以能闻名世界正是因为海明威在这本小说中的描写（This festival was brought to literary renown with the 1926 publication of Ernest Hemingway's novel The Sun Also Rises）. 因此在潘普洛纳城里的斗牛场大门旁，有一尊大作家海明威的青铜雕像。这是当地人民为感谢和纪念海明威而建的。

雕像的基座上镌刻着这样的文字：“海明威，诺贝尔文学奖获得者，本镇的朋友和圣费尔明节的推崇者，他巧妙描述和介绍了潘普洛纳。”

海明威本人是在1923首次来到潘普洛纳亲眼观看奔牛，所以触动非常深刻。这部分精彩的描绘我们会在之后的内容里领略到哦~

### 课文理解

今天的内容是这本小说第二辑（本书一共有三辑）的开头。根据Jake的描述，Brett去了圣塞瓦斯蒂安（San Sebastian）, Cohn也不见踪影，Frances则听说回去了英国。接下来登场的是Jake的一位之前发来电报说很快就会到法国的朋友（The wire was a cable from Bill Gorton, saying he was arriving on the France. — Chapter 7.1）. 他留给读者的印象就是喝得醉醺醺的之后胡言乱语，我们来看两个最具代表性的细节——



💧**Clue 1**: Brett is indeed very attractive.

**Evidence 1**: "Tight, Jake. I was tight."

Bill rubbed his forehead. "Remarkable thing," he said. "Don't know how it happened. Suddenly it happened."

"Last long?"

"Four days, Jake. Lasted just four days."

“我醉过，杰克，我喝醉过。”

比尔擦擦他的前额。“真是怪事，”他说。“不知怎的就醉了。突然醉了。”

“时间长吗？”

“四天，杰克。拖了正好四天。”



**Evidence 2**:  "Here's a taxidermist's," Bill said. "Want to buy anything? Nice stuffed dog?"

"Come on," I said. "You're pie-eyed."

“这里有家动物标本店商店，”比尔说。“想买什么吗？买只好看的狗标本？”

“走吧，”我说。“你醉了。”



当Jake问起Bill在维也纳玩得怎么样的时候，他说自己喝醉了整整有四天。接着讲起自己如何在拳击赛上遇到一个黑人拳击手被当地人欺负的事情的时候，他也是话不成句的："Remember something about a prize-fight. Enormous Vienna prize-fight. Had a nigger in it. Remember the nigger perfectly."



其实在这本小说里，除了Jake的这两位朋友，还有一位主角也总是酒不离口——Brett. 大家可以回想一下伯爵对她说过的话："You're always drinking, my dear. Why don't you just talk?"（Chapter 7.2）这其实就是对一战后美国青年沉迷酒精中放纵上享乐和麻痹自我的一个生动写照：一方面他们需要淡忘战争带来的伤害和阴影，另一方面他们要面对崩塌的道德价值体系重新寻找自我实现的出路，这造成了他们和过去以及未来之间的双重断裂，生活也就失去了意义。



回到故事里，Jake和Bill俩人正在街上闲逛的时候，遇上Brett正坐在出租车里（A taxi passed, some one in it waved, then banged for the driver to stop. The taxi backed up to the curb. In it was Brett）. Brett说自己是刚回到巴黎的，连澡都还没来得洗（"I say I'm just back. Haven't bathed even. Michael comes in to-night."）



这里有一个隐藏的细节，Brett和未婚夫Mike并不是一同回来的，Mike晚上才到巴黎，那么是谁和Brett一起去了圣塞瓦斯蒂安呢？（作者留了一个悬念，在后面的情节会揭晓哦~）我们先来看Bill在见到Brett后说了一句很有意思的话，这句话也展现了Brett在异性眼里的确非常有吸引力——



💧**Clue 2**: Brett is indeed very attractive.



**Evidence 1**: "Beautiful lady," said Bill. "Going to kidnap us."

“好一个美人儿，”比尔说。“要把我们拐走吧！”



Jake并没有对这句话作出回应，他当然清楚的知道Brett有多迷人（别忘了Jake在舞厅里重遇Brett的时候多仔细地把她浑身上下都打量了一遍：Brett was damned good-looking. She wore a slipover jersey sweater and a tweed skirt, and her hair was brushed back... — Chapter 3.2）



在明天的内容里，Brett的未婚夫Mike也即将要出场，我们会看到他同样如何地被Brett的魅力所“挟持”，并且Jake遇到这个名副其实的情敌究竟会怎么反应也值得期待哦~

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****世界上有哪些著名的戏剧节？**

Bill这趟旅行还去了美国，他说自己在纽约参加了一个非常盛大的戏剧节（New York was wonderful. There had been a grand theatrical season...）我们在学习盖茨比的时候对纽约的戏剧艺术中心百老汇（Broadway）作过详细的介绍，其实除了百老汇，纽约的中央公园每年也会上演戏剧界的一大重头戏——莎翁戏剧节。今天的彩蛋我们就来看一看包括纽约在内的世界各地著名的戏剧节~



\1. 美国·纽约莎士比亚戏剧节

New York Shakespeare Festival



莎士比亚戏剧节还有一个很好听的名字——“公园里的莎士比亚”（Shakespeare in the Park）. 这是一个每年夏天在纽约中央公园的免费演出，被称作纽约大众文化与经典戏剧艺术结合的典范。

美国戏剧名导和制作人约瑟夫·帕普上世纪50年代发起这一活动，初衷是希望让所有花不起钱的人能看到真正的经典戏剧表演。他率剧组在中央公园草坪免费演出，园方曾要求他支付草坪维护费，双方一度诉诸公堂。最后，纽约市政府出资，在公园内搭建了一个永久性的公共剧场：戴拉寇特剧院（Delacorte Theater）.



\2. 法国·阿维尼翁戏剧节

Festival d’Avignon

阿维尼翁戏剧节是目前全球最大的戏剧节，世界戏剧交流最重要的平台，由法国戏剧导演让·维拉尔于1947年创立。当时刚从二战阴影中走出的法国正努力重建，戏剧节的宗旨就是为了推动法国文化艺术的复苏与发展，让高雅的戏剧艺术走出殿堂、走入民间。

阿维尼翁戏剧节与众不同之处在于，除了拥有大量戏剧人才与演出作品之外，还有街头戏剧嘉年华和演出团组的街头表演宣传。阿维尼翁戏剧节的理念是，“让戏剧发生在城市的每一个角落”。因此在戏剧节期间，组委会为来自世界各地的戏剧艺术家们，安排了大量的街头表演空间。“不用走进剧场就能看到戏剧”，是阿维尼翁戏剧节的一大特色。



\3. 德国·柏林戏剧节

Berliner Festspiele



柏林戏剧节创立于1964年，与法国阿维尼翁戏剧节、英国爱丁堡艺术节并称为世界三大戏剧节，是德语区一年一度最重要、规模最大的戏剧艺术节。比起另两个戏剧节的娱乐展演的方式，柏林戏剧节更着重戏剧的专业性和体现当代的前进方向和最高水平。

柏林戏剧节被誉为德国戏剧的奥林匹克，评委会每年从400多个德语国家演出中挑选出的10部”最值得关注剧目”。



\4. 英国·爱丁堡国际艺术节

Edinburgh International Festival

爱丁堡戏剧节和阿尼翁戏剧节的创立时间相同，也是1947年，被称为“戏剧节中的浪荡王子”，他们的口号是“拒绝常规或反抗标准”，爱丁堡戏剧节注重的不是经典是前沿，不是优秀是狂欢！在爱丁堡戏剧节，你能看到来自世界各地最光怪陆离的演出，向传统和规范发起挑战。

爱丁堡国际艺术节最具特色的是以苏格兰风笛为特色的军乐仪队表演，而艺术节期间到处是汹涌的人潮和怪异的装扮，演员、舞者、导演、音乐家、街头艺人和游客全打成一片，到处都是演出。



\5. 意大利·那不勒斯戏剧节

Napoli Teatro Festival

意大利那不勒斯戏剧节是一个国际性的戏剧节，每一年的六月份在意大利的那不勒斯举行。这个戏剧节组织挑选和推出戏剧、展览和艺术表演，来自世界各地的艺术家精心制作，将各自不同的文化呈现在观众面前。通过这些艺术活动，戏剧节也使民族的和国际的体系有了建立起新型合作关系的可能。戏剧节既推出实验戏剧，也上演经典作品。

此外，戏剧节还促成了第一个以欧盟的专业演员为成员的欧洲戏剧公司（European Theatre Company）的建立。



## Chapter 8.2

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/3fbd249a58774f132da65f1c67bc5ccb-sz_393582.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)

"How are you, Jake?" "Great," I said. "I've had a good time."

Brett looked at me. "I was a fool to go away," she said. "One's an ass to leave Paris."

"Did you have a good time?" "Oh, all right. Interesting. Not frightfully amusing."

"See anybody?" "No, hardly anybody. I never went out."

"Didn't you swim?" "No. Didn't do a thing."

"Sounds like Vienna," Bill said.Brett wrinkled up the corners of her eyes at him.

"So that's the way it was in Vienna.""It was like everything in Vienna."

Brett smiled at him again."You've a nice friend, Jake."

"He's all right," I said. "He's a taxidermist."

"That was in another country," Bill said. "And besides all the animals were dead."

"One more," Brett said, "and I must run. Do send the waiter for a taxi."

"There's a line of them. Right out in front." "Good."

We had the drink and put Brett into her taxi.

"Mind you're at the Select around ten. Make him come. Michael will be there."

"We'll be there," Bill said. The taxi started and Brett waved.

"Quite a girl," Bill said. "She's damned nice. Who's Michael?"

"The man she's going to marry."

"Well, well," Bill said. "That's always just the stage I meet anybody.

What'll I send them? Think they'd like a couple of stuffed race-horses?"

"We better eat." "Is she really Lady something or other?" Bill asked in the taxi on our way down to the Ile Saint Louis (圣路易岛).

"Oh, yes. In the stud-book and everything." "Well, well."

We ate dinner at Madame Lecomte's restaurant on the far side of the island.

It was crowded with Americans and we had to stand up and wait for a place.

Some one had put it in the American Women's Club list as a quaint restaurant on the Paris quais ([法]河畔) as yet untouched by Americans, so we had to wait forty-five minutes for a table.

"Doesn't get us a table, though," Bill said. "Grand woman, though."

We had a good meal, a roast chicken, new green beans, mashed potatoes, a salad, and some apple-pie and cheese.

"You've got the world here all right,"Bill said to Madame Lecomte.

She raised her hand. "Oh, my God!""You'll be rich." "I hope so."

After the coffee and a fine (白兰地) we got the bill, chalked up the same as ever on a slate, that was doubtless one of the "quaint" features, paid it, shook hands, and went out.

"You never come here any more, Monsieur Barnes," Madame Lecomte said.

"Too many compatriots." "Come at lunch-time. It's not crowded then." "Good. I'll be down soon."

> ==compatriot英 [kəmˈpætriət] 美 [kəmˈpeɪtriət] n. 同胞；同国人==

We walked along under the trees that grew out over the river on the Quai d'Orléans (奥尔良码头) side of the island.

Across the river were the broken walls of old houses that were being torn down.

"They're going to cut a street through." "They would," Bill said.

We walked on and circled the island.

The river was dark and a bateau mouche (著名游船公司名称，这里泛指平底游览船)went by, all bright with lights, going fast and quiet up and out of sight under the bridge.

Down the river was Notre Dame (巴黎圣母院) squatting against the night sky.

> ==squat英 [skwɒt] 美 [skwɑ:t] vi. 蹲，蹲伏==

We crossed to the left bank of the Seine by the wooden foot-bridge from the Quai de Bethune (贝蒂纳码头), and stopped on the bridge and looked down the river at Notre Dame.

Standing on the bridge the island looked dark, the houses were high against the sky, and the trees were shadows.

"It's pretty grand," Bill said. "God, I love to get back."

We leaned on the wooden rail of the bridge and looked up the river to the lights of the big bridges.

Below the water was smooth and black. It made no sound against the piles of the bridge.

A man and a girl passed us. They were walking with their arms around each other.

We crossed the bridge and walked up the Rue du Cardinal Lemoine (勒姆瓦纳红衣主教路).

It was steep walking, and we went all the way up to the Place Contrescarpe (护墙广场).

The arc-light shone through the leaves of the trees in the square, and underneath the trees was an S bus ready to start.

Music came out of the door of the Negre Joyeux. Through the window of the Café Aux Amateurs I saw the long zinc bar.

Outside on the terrace working people were drinking. In the open kitchen of the Amateurs a girl was cooking potato-chips in oil.

There was an iron pot of stew. The girl ladled some onto a plate for an old man who stood holding a bottle of red wine in one hand.

"Want to have a drink?" "No," said Bill. "I don't need it."

We turned to the right off the Place Contrescarpe, walking along smooth narrow streets with high old houses on both sides.

Some of the houses jutted out toward the street. Others were cut back.

> *注意cut back在其他场景中往往是作为固定搭配理解为“削减，缩减”，比如：Education spending cannot be cut back any further.（教育支出再也不能缩减了。） 

We came onto the Rue du Pot de Fer (铁锅街) and followed it along until it brought us to the rigid north and south of the Rue Saint Jacques(圣雅克路) and then walked south, past Val de Grace (圣恩谷教堂), set back behind the courtyard and the iron fence, to the Boulevard du Port Royal (皇港大街).

"What do you want to do?" I asked. "Go up to the café and see Brett and Mike?"

"Why not?"We walked along Port Royal until it became Montparnasse (蒙帕纳斯), and then on past the Lilas, Lavigne's, and all the little cafés, Damoy's, crossed the street to the Rotonde, past its lights and tables to the Select.

Michael came toward us from the tables. He was tanned and healthy-looking.

"Hel-lo, Jake," he said. "Hel-lo! Hel-lo! How are you, old lad?"

"You look very fit, Mike." "Oh, I am. I'm frightfully fit.

> ==frightfully英 [ˈfraɪtfəli] 美 [ˈfraɪtfəlɪ] adv. 可怕地==

I've done nothing but walk. Walk all day long. One drink a day with my mother at tea."

Bill had gone into the bar. He was standing talking with Brett, who was sitting on a high stool, her legs crossed.

She had no stockings on."It's good to see you, Jake," Michael said.

"I'm a little tight you know. Amazing,isn't it? Did you see my nose?"

There was a patch of dried blood on the bridge of his nose.

> ==patch英 [pætʃ] 美 [pætʃ] n. 补丁，补片；眼罩；斑点==

"An old lady's bags did that," Mike said. "I reached up to help her with them and they fell on me."

Brett gestured at him from the bar with her cigarette-holder and wrinkled the corners of her eyes.

"An old lady," said Mike. "Her bags fell on me. Let's go in and see Brett.

I say, she is a piece. You are a lovely lady, Brett. Where did you get that hat?"

"Chap bought it for me. Don't you like it?"

"It's a dreadful hat. Do get a good hat."

"Oh, we've so much money now," Brett said. "I say, haven't you met Bill yet? You are a lovely host, Jake."

She turned to Mike. "This is Bill Gorton. This drunkard is Mike Campbell. Mr. Campbell is an undischarged bankrupt."

"Aren't I, though? You know I met my ex-partner yesterday in London. Chap who did me in."

"What did he say?" "Bought me a drink. I thought I might as well take it.

I say, Brett, you are a lovely piece. Don't you think she's beautiful?"

"Beautiful. With this nose?"

"It's a lovely nose. Go on, point it at me. Isn't she a lovely piece?"

"Couldn't we have kept the man in Scotland?"

"I say, Brett, let's turn in early." "Don't be indecent, Michael. Remember there are ladies at this bar."

"Isn't she a lovely piece? Don't you think so, Jake?"

"There's a fight to-night," Bill said. "Like to go?"

"Fight," said Mike. "Who's fighting?" "Ledoux and somebody."

"He's very good, Ledoux," Mike said. "I'd like to see it, rather"— he was making an effort to pull himself together —

"but I can't go. I had a date with this thing here. I say, Brett, do get a new hat."

Brett pulled the felt hat down far over one eye and smiled out from under it.

"You two run along to the fight. I'll have to be taking Mr. Campbell home directly."

"I'm not tight," Mike said. "Perhaps just a little. I say, Brett, you are a lovely piece."

> ==outburst英 [ˈaʊtbɜ:st] 美 [ˈaʊtbɜ:rst] n. （蒸汽，怒气等的）爆发；破裂==

"I say, you are a lovely piece."

We said good night. "I'm sorry I can't go," Mike said.

Brett laughed. I looked back from the door.

Mike had one hand on the bar and was leaning toward Brett, talking.

Brett was looking at him quite coolly, but the corners of her eyes were smiling.

Outside on the pavement I said: "Do you want to go to the fight?"

"Sure," said Bill. "If we don't have to walk."

"Mike was pretty excited about his girl friend," I said in the taxi.

"Well," said Bill. "You can't blame him such a hell of a lot."

### 背景知识

**💧****Notre Dame de Paris 巴黎圣母院**



We crossed to the left bank of the Seine by the wooden foot-bridge from the Quai de Bethune, and stopped on the bridge and looked down the river at Notre Dame.（我们从贝休恩河畔经小木桥向塞纳河左岸走去，在桥上站住了眺望河下游的巴黎圣母院。）



巴黎圣母院Notre Dame de Paris也可以称作Notre-Dame Cathedral, 从名字Cathedral就可以知道它是一座天主教堂，并且它的建筑风格就是典型的中世纪哥特式。巴黎圣母院坐落于巴黎第四区的西堤岛（ Île de la Cité）上，倚靠塞纳河畔，地处整个巴黎的市中心。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/911cd1532b7602ce372bec131c1705c3-sz_353796.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



“Notre Dame”原意为“我们的女士”，这位女士不是指别人，正是指耶稣的母亲圣母玛丽亚。圣母院最早的历史可以追溯到罗马的提庇留大帝（Emperor Tiberius）时代（大约是公元14年到37年之间），尔后经过将近千年的变迁，新的教堂在原址上开始建造，也就是从1163年到1345年，我们现在看到的圣母院落成。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/4739a2cd0e358102485bdf7c595caff9-sz_118340.jpg?x-oss-process=image/resize,w_1080/auto-orient,1/crop,x_0,y_0,w_1000,h_623)

（潘普洛纳的乌尔巴萨山脉自然公园）



之后圣母院被用作全欧洲工匠组织和教育组织集会的地方。同时因为这些历史渊源，巴黎最著名的索邦大学（Sorbonne），便坐落于此。18世纪末的法国大革命时期，教堂的大部分财宝都被破坏或者掠夺，处处可见被移位的雕刻品和砍了头的塑像，唯一的大钟幸免没有被熔毁。之后教堂改为理性圣殿，后来又变成藏酒仓库，直到1804年拿破仑执政时，才将其还为宗教之用。



圣母院主体部分平面呈十字形，向所有的哥特式建筑一样，两翼较短，中轴较长，中庭的上方有一个高达90米的尖塔。塔顶是一个细长的十字架，远望仿佛与天穹相接，据说，耶稣受刑时所用的十字架及其冠冕就在这个十字架下面的球内封存着。

圣母院在建筑细节上也蕴藏了很多宗教故事的因素，据说是以前的神职人员借由这些图像来做传道之用。比如正面中央的拱门描述的是耶稣在天庭的“最后审判”（Illustration of the Last Judgement）↓

巴黎圣母院起初闻名于世是因为它改变了原本哥特式建筑笨重压抑的范式，在设计上独具动感和轻灵。如今它兼具艺术、宗教和历史价值于一体。对于游客来说，登上圣母院眺望巴黎并俯瞰塞纳河的景致已经成为到巴黎必不可少的行程了。

### 课文理解

在酒桌上，Jake并没有多和Brett搭话，而是一直在默默观察Brett和Bill聊天时候的神情。这一个细节在今天的内容里一共强调了三次，包括在Brett的未婚夫Mike来到之后，Jake似乎总是看到Brett有一个相同的表情动作——眯眼睛的时候眼角挤出皱纹，并且满含笑意。Jake为什么会格外在意这个动作呢？我们先来看看原文里是怎么描写的——

💧**Clue 1**:  Jake has been watching Brett's expressions carefully.

**Evidence 1**: "Sounds like Vienna," Bill said. Brett wrinkled up the corners of her eyes at him...Brett smiled at him again.

“听上去很像维也纳，”比尔说。勃莱特眯缝起眼睛看他，眼角出现皱纹……勃莱特又对他笑了笑。

**Evidence 2**: Brett gestured at him from the bar with her cigarette-holder and wrinkled the corners of her eyes.

勃莱特在酒吧间里拿她的烟嘴像他打手势，挤眼睛。

**Evidence 3**: Brett was looking at him quite coolly, but the corners of her eyes were smiling.

勃莱特相当冷淡地看着他，但是眼角带着笑意。

Brett对Bill和Mike都作出了“眯缝着眼”这个动作，很容易让人想到是Brett在有意向说话的对方眉目传情。又或者是她天生的眼含媚态，所以不管她是否真心喜欢对方，在异性眼里都有着不可抗拒的吸引力。但另一方面要注意的是，这个故事的叙述者是Jake，因此所有角色的动作和神情都是经过“滤镜”处理的。

回到我们一开始提出的问题，为什么Jake这么在意这个动作呢？这里有一个可能大家已经忘记的细节，在Chapter 7.2里，Brett对伯爵说自己从来不开Jake的玩笑的时候，也做了这么一个动作：Brett looked at me and wrinkled up the corners of her eyes.

这里暗示了Brett浪荡的本性（Jake想必早有意识但还是会感觉不舒服，或者说是产生嫉妒心理）。Brett未必对每个交往的异性都是真心喜欢，但她总可以释放出自己的魅力，让别人对她穷追不舍。

作者其实也在一定程度上物化了Brett的形象：她对异性的吸引并不是以情感为目的，而是来自于她在物质上的渴望（Jake提到过Mike很快赚一大笔钱），所以即便她不是那么喜欢Mike（否则不会眼神冷淡地看着他），她也成功地依靠自己的魅力让Mike对她如此神魂颠倒。

而通过Jake对Mike的描述，我们也可以感受到他打心底里对Mike的厌恶——



💧**Clue 2**: Jake detests Mike much.

**Evidence 1**: "Isn't she a lovely piece? Don't you think so, Jake?"

“她是不是个迷人的东西？你看呢，杰克？”

**Evidence 2**: "Mike was pretty excited about his girl friend," I said in the taxi.

“迈克为他这个女朋友真是上劲得很，”我在出租车上说。

Mike喝醉了酒不分场合地和Brett调情，并且言语粗俗，毫无礼教。Jake则从头至尾也没有应和过他，直到和Bill一起上了出租车，才说了一句意味不明的话。在Jake看来，Brett和Mike只有肉体的联结，这也是他最大的折磨。但他却无力改变现状，正如Bill最后对他说的："You can't blame him such a hell of a lot."（“这你哪能多责怪他啊。”）言下之意也就是，所有人都会为Brett着迷，而Brett偏偏又是从不自持的那种类型。所以Jake只能忍受这种痛苦。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****海明威在巴黎的生活印迹**

海明威曾经写过一部回忆录——《流动的盛宴》（*A Moveable Feast*），记录的就是他从1921年到1926年旅居巴黎的生活。这段经历也是他和第一任妻子哈德莉·理查森在一起相伴度过的时光，俩人虽然过得清贫朴素，但也充满了爱情和欢乐。

海明威进行这本书的写作已经是在四十年以后 ，虽然书名里的“盛宴”其实早已经消失无踪，但精彩的故事和氛围却永远地留在了书里。海明威对巴黎记忆的珍视也可以从他在扉页上的题词读出来：“假如你有幸年轻时在巴黎生活过，那么你此后一生中不论去到哪里她都与你同在，因为巴黎是一席流动的盛宴”。

今天的彩蛋我们就来找一找在巴黎有哪些地方曾经留下了这位大文豪的生活印迹，也许跟着海明威的步伐，我们也可以领略巴黎的另一番风味。



\1. 雅各酒店

Hôtel Jacob

海明威是在小说家舍伍德·安德森（Sherwood Anderson）的建议下移居巴黎的，当时他正准备和新婚妻子去罗马旅行。但是刚来巴黎的时候，海明威仍然还是个穷困青年，刚丢了记者的工作，带着战争的创伤和新婚妻子哈德利下榻在了拉丁区雅各街44号的雅各酒店。

这家酒店如今已改名为英国酒店（Hôtel d'Angleterre），星级三星，房价将近300欧一晚，比一个普通巴黎工薪阶层月薪的十分之一多一些。



\2. 勒穆瓦纳红衣主教路74号

Rue du Cardinal Lemoine

后来海明威选择了租住在先贤祠附近勒姆瓦纳红衣主教路（Rue du Cardinal Lemoine）74号的一间公寓，夫妻二人一直住到1923年8月两人短暂离开巴黎。

年轻的海明威虽然穷困迷茫却又对于未来踌躇满志，“一个有两居室的套间，没有热水也没有室内盥洗设施，只有一个消毒的便桶。地板上铺一块上好的弹簧褥垫做一张舒适的床，墙上挂着我们喜爱的画，这仍不失为一个使人感到欢乐愉快的房间”。

而今，这间居室大门的墙上挂着一块牌子，除了写着海明威的住所位置、居住时间等信息，还不忘加上一句：“这个街区是海明威当时很喜爱的一个街区，他的写作风格在这里成形，他和邻里亲如家人。”



3.笛卡尔路工作室

Rue Descartes

海明威为了努力写作，在笛卡尔路（Rue Descartes）39号的顶层花60法郎的月租，租了一间小房间作为工作室。这地方离他在勒穆瓦纳红衣主教路的公寓并不远。

“随着最初几场寒冷的冬雨，这座城市的一切令人沮丧的现象都突然出现了：高大的白色房子再也看不见顶端，你在街上走，看到的只是发黑的潮湿的路面，关了门的小店铺，卖草药的小贩，文具店和报亭，那个助产士——二流的——以及诗人魏尔伦（Paul Verlaine）去世所在的旅馆，旅馆的顶层有一间我工作的房间。” ——《流动的盛宴》



\4. 莎士比亚书店

Shakespeare & Company

在生计窘迫的那些日子里，海明威读的书都是从莎士比亚书店借来的。 书店主人西尔维娅是一个非常好的人，当海明威第一次走进这家书店时，西尔维娅很爽快地表示他可以想借多少就借多少，等有了钱再付押金也可以。

“在那些日子里，我没有钱买书。我从莎士比亚图书公司出借书籍的图书馆借书看。莎士比亚图书公司是西尔维亚·比奇开设在奥德翁路12号的一家图书馆和书店。在一条刮着寒风的街上，这是个温暖而惬意的去处，冬天生着一只大火炉，桌子上和书架上都摆满了书，橱窗里摆的是新书，墙上挂的是已经去世的和当今健在的著名作家的照片。” ——《流动的盛宴》



5.卢森堡公园

Jardin du Luxembourg

海明威曾经短暂地离开过巴黎，在1924年回来之后，搬进了田园圣母路（Rue Notre-Dame des Champs）113号的新公寓（如今这里没有留下任何海明威住过的痕迹）。刚开始他没有工作，成了职业作家，经济上捉襟见肘，门缝里常常塞进来被退回的稿件。当时郁闷的海明威常常到卢森堡公园里去散心。

“当你放弃了记者的工作，当你写一些没人看的故事的时候，当你饿着肚子，还要骗家里人说是跟朋友一起吃饭时，最理想的去处就是卢森堡公园了。因为在观象台广场（Place de l'Observatoire）和付吉拉尔街（Rue de Vaugirard）之间的路上，既看不到也闻不到食物的味道。” ——《流动的盛宴》

留在海明威记忆中的巴黎旧貌经过一百年的变迁可能已经大大变样，虽然街道、房子，甚至酒吧和咖啡馆还在原来的地方，叫着原来的名字。如果大家想要了解更多海明威对巴黎的印象，也可以去读一读《流动的盛宴》这本书哦~

## Chapter 9.1

The Ledoux-Kid Francis fight was the night of the 20th of June. It was a good fight.

The morning after the fight I had a letter from Robert Cohn, written from Hendaye (昂代，法国一避暑地).

He was having a very quiet time, he said, bathing, playing some golf and much bridge.

Hendaye had a splendid beach, but he was anxious to start on the fishing-trip.

When would I be down?

If I would buy him a double-tapered line he would pay me when I came down.

> come down 并不是表示“下来”哦~这里down是“往南”的意思（因为地图一般是按照“上北下南”的方式来画的，长此以往人们就开始用down来表示“向南”）。Cohn正在昂代（Hendaye），这座城市在巴黎西南方向，所以Jake从巴黎到昂代也就是“南下”。
>
> 下文出现的go down也是一个意思："Who did you think I went down to San Sebastian with?"

That same morning I wrote Cohn from the office that Bill and I would leave Paris on the 25th unless I wired him otherwise,

and would meet him at Bayonne (巴荣纳，法国一海港城市), where we could get a bus over the mountains to Pamplona (潘普洛纳).

The same evening about seven o'clock I stopped in at the Select to see Michael and Brett.

They were not there, and I went over to the Dingo.

They were inside sitting at the bar.

"Hello, darling." Brett put out her hand.

"Hello, Jake," Mike said. "I understand I was tight last night."

"Weren't you, though," Brett said. "Disgraceful business."

"Look," said Mike, "when do you go down to Spain? Would you mind if we came down with you?"

"It would be grand."

"You wouldn't mind, really? I've been at Pamplona, you know. Brett's mad to go. You're sure we wouldn't just be a bloody nuisance?"

>
> I don't want to be a nuisance so tell me if you want to be alone.

"Don't talk like a fool."

"I'm a little tight, you know. I wouldn't ask you like this if I weren't. You're sure you don't mind?"

"Oh, shut up, Michael," Brett said. "How can the man say he'd mind now? I'll ask him later."

"But you don't mind, do you?"

"Don't ask that again unless you want to make me sore. Bill and I go down on the morning of the 25th."

"By the way, where is Bill?" Brett asked.

"He's out at Chantilly (香蒂利，巴黎以北的一座城市) dining with some people."

"He's a good chap."

"Splendid chap," said Mike. "He is, you know."

"You don't remember him," Brett said.

"I do. Remember him perfectly. Look, Jake, we'll come down the night of the 25th. Brett can't get up in the morning."

"Indeed not!"

"If our money comes and you're sure you don't mind."

"It will come, all right. I'll see to that."

"Tell me what tackle to send for."

>
> ②send for sth 表示“去信索要，让某人寄来”，一般办这件事的对象会省略不说（可以理解为因为不重要），比如：Send for your free catalogue today.（今天就写信去索要免费目录。）

"Get two or three rods with reels, and lines, and some flies."

"I won't fish," Brett put in.

"Get two rods, then, and Bill won't have to buy one."

"Right," said Mike. "I'll send a wire to the keeper."

"Won't it be splendid," Brett said. "Spain! We will have fun."

"The 25th. When is that?" "Saturday."

"We will have to get ready."

"I say," said Mike, "I'm going to the barber's."

"I must bathe," said Brett. "Walk up to the hotel with me, Jake. Be a good chap."

"We have got the loveliest hotel," Mike said. "I think it's a brothel!"

> ==brothel英 [ˈbrɒθl] 美 [ˈbrɑ:θl] n. 妓院==

"We left our bags here at the Dingo when we got in, and they asked us at this hotel if we wanted a room for the afternoon only. Seemed frightfully pleased we were going to stay all night."

"I believe it's a brothel," Mike said. "And I should know."

"Oh, shut it and go and get your hair cut."

Mike went out. Brett and I sat on at the bar.

"Have another?" "Might."

"I needed that," Brett said.

We walked up the Rue Delambre (德朗布尔路 ).

"I haven't seen you since I've been back," Brett said.

"No." "How are you, Jake?" "Fine."

Brett looked at me. "I say," she said, "is Robert Cohn going on this trip?"

"Yes. Why?" "Don't you think it will be a bit rough on him?"

"Why should it?" "Who did you think I went down to San Sebastian with?"

"Congratulations," I said.

We walked along.

"What did you say that for?"

"I don't know. What would you like me to say?"

We walked along and turned a corner.

"He behaved rather well, too. He gets a little dull."

"Does he?" "I rather thought it would be good for him."

"You might take up social service."

"Didn't you really know?"

"No," I said. "I guess I didn't think about it."

"That's up to him," I said. "Tell him you're coming. He can always not come."

"I'll write him and give him a chance to pull out of it."

>
> *Jake让Brett给Cohn写信说她也要去，这样Cohn或许会因为难堪而放弃加入。

I did not see Brett again until the night of the 24th of June.

"Did you hear from Cohn?"

"Rather. He's keen about it."

"My God!" "I thought it was rather odd myself."

"Says he can't wait to see me."

"Does he think you're coming alone?"

"No. I told him we were all coming down together. Michael and all."

"He's wonderful." "Isn't he?"

They expected their money the nextday. We arranged to meet at Pamplona.

They would go directly to San Sebastian and take the train from there.

We would all meet at the Montoya (蒙托亚，旅馆名称) in Pamplona.

If they did not turn up on Monday at the latest we would go on ahead up to Burguete (布尔戈特，位于巴黎西南) in the mountains, to start fishing.

There was a bus to Burguete. I wrote out an itinerary so they could follow us.

Bill and I took the morning train from the Gare d'Orsay (道赛车站).

It was a lovely day, not too hot, and the country was beautiful from the start.

We went back into the diner and had breakfast.

Leaving the dining-car I asked the conductor for tickets for the first service.

"Nothing until the fifth." "What's this?"

There were never more than two servings of lunch on that train, and always plenty of places for both of them.

> ==serving英 [ˈsɜ:vɪŋ] 美 [ˈsɜ:rvɪŋ] n. 服务；上菜；（食物或饮料的）一份==

"They're all reserved," the dining-carconductor said. "There will be a fifthservice at three-thirty."

"This is serious," I said to Bill."Give him ten francs."

"Here," I said. "We want to eat in the first service."

The conductor put the ten francs in his pocket.

"Thank you," he said. "I would advise you gentlemen to get some sandwiches. All the places for the first four services were reserved at the office of the company."

"You'll go a long way, brother," Bill said to him in English. "I suppose if I'd given you five francs you would have advised us to jump off the train."

"Comment? ([法]怎么说？)" "Go to hell!" said Bill. "Get the sandwiches made and a bottle of wine. You tell him, Jake."

"And send it up to the next car." I described where we were.

### 背景知识

**💧****1. Hendaye 昂代**

The morning after the fight I had a letter from Robert Cohn, written from Hendaye.（比赛的第二天早晨，我收到罗伯特·科恩从昂代寄来的信。）

昂代（Hendaye）是法国比利牛斯-大西洋省的一个市镇，属于巴约讷（Bayonne）昂代伊镇（Hendaye）。它位于法国和西班牙的边境上，小镇的西面即是将法国和西班牙隔开的比达索阿海湾，北面则是加斯科涅湾。

昂代伊拥有3.5公里的沙滩，是巴斯克（Basque, 我们之前提到的贝壳湾也是在巴斯克地区）海岸最长的沙滩。

城镇有两个火车站和一个地铁站：昂代伊火车站（Hendaye SNCF）和翁达莱茨（Les Deux Jumeaux Ondarraitz）火车站均在波尔多至伊伦（西班牙）的铁路线上。此外，今天的圣塞瓦斯蒂安地铁（西班牙）在昂代伊火车站设有起始站，终点站为拉萨尔特-奥里亚，途径西班牙圣塞瓦斯蒂安省的若干站点。



**💧****2. Rue Delambre 德朗布尔路**

We walked up the Rue Delambre.（我们走在德朗布尔路上。）

Brett和Jake一起漫步的这条路其实也是海明威本人在巴黎的时候经常踏足的。德朗布尔路位于巴黎第14区，距离蒙特帕纳斯塔和火车站只有三分钟的步行距离。

而这条路的不寻常之处在于，海明威第一次见到菲兹杰拉德，就是在这条路上的丁戈（Dingo）咖啡馆里：

“我初次遇见司各特·菲茨杰拉德就发生了一件非常奇怪的事。司各特碰上很多奇怪的事，但是这件事我永远忘不掉。那天我正在德朗布尔路上的丁戈饭店的酒吧间，跟一些毫无价值的人坐在一起，这时他走了进来，作了自我介绍……司各特当时看起来像个孩子，一张脸介于英俊和漂亮之间。”

俩人后来交往逐渐深入，菲兹杰拉德还把自己的小说《了不起的盖茨比》拿给海明威看，海明威自然对此也是赞誉有加：“既然他能写出一部像《了不起的盖茨比》这样卓越的书，我坚信他准能写出一部甚至更优秀的书来。”

虽然海明威对菲兹杰拉德的婚姻不抱肯定态度，但他依然维持了跟菲兹杰拉德非常友好并亲密的关系。

### 课文理解

按照之前的约定，Cohn和Jake以及Bill要一同去西班牙的潘普洛纳（Pamplona）过节。Mike听说后便也要求他和Brett一起同行。但Brett在之后和Jake的单独对话里却透露了她的担忧——她觉得Cohn可能会尴尬不舒服，而这一切都是因为她在此之前是和Cohn一起去的圣塞巴斯蒂安（San Sebastian）. Jake得知后语气充满嘲讽，对Cohn也敌意倍增——



💧**Clue 1**: Jake gradually takes Cohn as a rival.



**Evidence 1**: "Who did you think I went down to San Sebastian with?"

"Congratulations," I said.

“你看我到圣塞瓦斯蒂安是和谁一起去的？”

“恭喜你了，”我说。



**Evidence 2**: "I rather thought it would be good for him."

"You might take up social service."

“我原以为这会对他有好处。”

“你大可以搞社会公益事业。”



读到这里不难感觉出Jake已经对Cohn竖起敌意，如果前面他还只是略有嫉妒，这里他就已经在心里把Cohn当成了自己的“对手”。这当中其实还暗藏了一个隐喻，也是作者独具匠心的安排——“拳击场”即“情场”。但不论是在什么情形下，Jake恐怕都不占优势（首先Cohn是曾经夺过冠军的拳击手，其次是Jake在一战中受了致命伤导致他永远使Brett满足）。

既然Jake把Cohn作为他的“劲敌”，也就不难理解为什么这本小说开篇两个词就是“Robert Cohn”了，而且还花了相当的笔墨来铺垫。

而Mike虽然作为Brett的未婚夫，对她的态度却非常轻浮，或者说，他只是通过Brett来满足自己的情欲——



💧**Clue 2**: Mike is more sexually attracted to Brett.



**Evidence 1**: "We have got the loveliest hotel," Mike said. "I think it's a brothel!"

“我们住的这家旅馆是再妙不过的了，”迈克说。“我看像是家妓院！”



在没有前因后果的情况下，“妓院”这个词出现在这里其实非常突兀。一种合理的猜测是，作者在暗示，Brett于Mike来说其实就是“妓女”（prostitue）的角色 。这种猜测的另一个依据是，在昨天的内容里，Mike喝醉了酒一直嚷嚷说“She (Brett) is a piece”. piece这个词我们解释过，非常粗俗下流，并且充满挑逗和暗示。如果大家再仔细读原文，就会发现字里行间其实都透露着Jake对Mike这种二流子作风的厌恶，比如Jake每次描写Mike的出场都是在他喝得烂醉胡言乱语的时候。

回到故事里，由于Mike还没拿到汇款，所以他和Brett只能推迟出发。而Jake和Bill则一起乘火车先出发，最后大家直接在潘普洛纳碰面。需要注意的是故事的发生场所即将发生改变（从法国巴黎到西班牙的巴斯克地区），并且随着主角们的聚头，原有的和新生的矛盾关系都会一起激化，推动情节走向高潮~

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****go south 可不是“往南走”**

今天我们介绍了一个表达：go down 表示“往南走，南下”。大家可能会想可不可以直接说go south呢？答案是否定的。



\1. go south

go south 作为俚语表达，和方位其实一点关系都没有。它一般是用来描述一件事情“走下坡路，失败，变糟糕”（to decline, become bad or to fail），而要表达“往南走”就只能说go to the south或是go down to the south. 我们来看一个例句：

It seems like all our moral standards have just gone south.

看来我们的道德标准都下降了。

go south也可以用head south或是take a south turn来替换。关于这个俚语的起源，是因为在一部分美洲土著语中，go south是对“死亡”的委婉表达，所以才有了“衰落、败坏”这层含义。

其实除了go south, go west和go north也不是用来表达方位的哦，接下来我们分别看一看~



\2. go west

go west我们很容易和中文里的“归西”联系起来，其实go west就是英语用来表达死亡的一种委婉辞（其他的还有：fall on sleep; sleep the final sleep; go to heaven等等）。这是因为西边是太阳落下的地方，所以west就代表了“消亡”。比如：

When I go west, I don't want any elaborate funeral services in my honor, OK?

如果有一天我去世了，可以不要精心给我准备什么葬礼仪式吗？

此外go west还可以形容“（事物）破灭，失败”，比如：

His hopes of a professional singing career went west long ago.

他想要发展职业歌手生涯的希望很早之前就破灭了。



\3. go north (of)

go north表示的意思和go south相反，并且一般用来形容“数字或数量”（figure or amount），后面加上of, 指“比……高，超过”（higher than, in excess of）, 比如：

What's your average deal size? It's gone north of $250,000 per contract even as high as $300,000 per contract.

你的平均交易规模是多大？现在每笔交易已经超过25万美元并且达到30万美元了。

最后需要提醒大家的是，go east并没有任何引申的含义哦~

In our compartment were a man and his wife and their young son.

> ==compartment英 [kəmˈpɑ:tmənt] 美 [kəmˈpɑ:rtmənt] n. 隔间（尤指火车车厢中的）；区划==

"I suppose you're Americans, aren't you?" the man asked. "Having a good trip?"

"Wonderful," said Bill.

"That's what you want to do. Travel while you're young. Mother and I always wanted to get over, but we had to wait a while."

"You could have come over ten years ago, if you'd wanted to," the wife said.

"What you always said was: 'See America first!' I will say we've seen a good deal, take it one way and another."

"Say, there's plenty of Americans on this train," the husband said.

"They've got seven cars of them from Dayton, Ohio. They've been ona pilgrimage to Rome, and now they're going down to Biarritz (比亚里茨，法国度假胜地) and Lourdes (卢尔德，法国南部城市)."

> ==pilgrimage英 [ˈpɪlgrɪmɪdʒ] 美 [ˈpɪlɡrəmɪdʒ] n. 朝圣之旅；参拜圣地；人生的旅程==

"So, that's what they are. Pilgrims. Goddam Puritans," Bill said.

"What part of the States you boys from?"

"Kansas City," I said. "He's from Chicago."

"You both going to Biarritz?"

"No. We're going fishing in Spain."

"Well, I never cared for it, myself. There's plenty that do out where I come from, though. We got some of the best fishing in the State of Montana. I've been out with the boys, but I never cared for it any."

"Mighty little fishing you did on them trips," his wife said.He winked at us.

>
> ②on them trips 可以看成on those trips, them在这里就是指trips（trips即them的同位语）。

> *这里虽然是肯定句，但实际是讽刺的口吻哦~在上文里她的丈夫说自己对钓鱼没多大兴趣（"We got some of the best fishing in the State of Montana. I've been out with the boys, but I never cared for it any."）所以妻子的言下之意就是：你钓鱼钓得还真“少”啊！

"You know how the ladies are. If there's a jug goes along, or a case of beer, they think it's hell and damnation."

"That's the way men are," his wife said to us.

She smoothed her comfortable lap. "I voted against prohibition to please him, and because I like a little beer in the house, and then he talks that way. It's a wonder they ever find any one to marry them."

"Say," said Bill, "do you know that gang of Pilgrim Fathers have cornered the dining-car until half past three this afternoon?"

> <font color=red>"Say," said Bill, "do you know that gang of Pilgrim Fathers have cornered the dining-car until half past three this afternoon?"</font>

>
> ②corner 作动词最直接的含义就是“把……逼入角落（也可以引申为困境）”；还可以指“强求与某人面谈”（这层含义和我们前面介绍的buttonhole是一样的），比如：Thomas managed to corner the young producer-director for an interview.（汤马斯缠着年轻的制片兼导演给了他一次面试的机会。）
>
> 另外，corner还延伸出了“霸占，垄断”的意思，比如：They’ve been trying to corner the market by buying up all the wheat in sight.（他们想把所有能得到的小麦都买下来以垄断市场。）所以这里的corner the dining-car就是指“包围、霸占了整个餐车”。

"How do you mean? They can't do a thing like that."

"You try and get seats."

"Well, mother, it looks as though we better go back and get another breakfast."

She stood up and straightened her dress.

"Will you boys keep an eye on our things? Come on, Hubert."

They all three went up to the wagon restaurant.

A little while after they were gone a steward went through announcing the first service, and pilgrims, with their priests, commenced filing down the corridor.

> 吊唁者依次经过棺木。

Our friend and his family did not come back.

A waiter passed in the corridor with our sandwiches and the bottle of Chablis (夏布利白葡萄酒), and we called him in.

"You're going to work to-day," I said.

He nodded his head. "They start now, at ten-thirty."

"When do we eat?" "Huh! When do I eat?"

He left two glasses for the bottle, and we paid him for the sandwiches and tipped him.

"I'll get the plates," he said, "or bring them with you."

We ate the sandwiches and drank the Chablis and watched the country out of the window.

The grain was just beginning to ripen and the fields were full of poppies.

The pastureland was green, and there were fine trees, and sometimes big rivers and chateaux off in the trees.

> ==pastureland英 [ˈpɑ:stʃəlænd] 美 [ˈpæstʃərlænd] n. 牧草地，牧场==

At Tours (图尔，位于巴黎西南) we got off and bought another bottle of wine, and when we got back in the compartment the gentleman from Montana and his wife and his son, Hubert, were sitting comfortably.

"Is there good swimming in Biarritz?" asked Hubert.

"That boy's just crazy till he can get in the watei" his mother said. "It's pretty hard on youngsters travelling."

> ==youngster英 [ˈjʌŋstə(r)] 美 [ˈjʌŋstɚ] n. 少年；年轻人；小孩子==

"There's good swimming," I said. "But it's dangerous when it's rough."

"Did you get a meal?" Bill asked.

"We sure did. We set right there when they started to come in, and they must have just thought we were in the party. One of the waiters said something to us in French, and then they just sent three of them back."

"They thought we were snappers, allright," the man said. "It certainly shows you the power of the Catholic Church.

It's a pity you boys ain't Catholics. You could get a meal, then, all right."

"I am," I said. "That's what makes me so sore."

Finally at a quarter past four we had lunch. Bill had been rather difficult at the last.

He buttonholed a priest who was coming back with one of the returning streams of pilgrims.

"When do us Protestants get a chance to eat, father?"

"I don't know anything about it. Haven't you got tickets?"

"It's enough to make a man join the Klan," Bill said. The priest looked back at him.

Inside the dining-car the waiters served the fifth successive table d'hôte (列车套餐) meal.

>
> ②table d'hôte 翻译成英文是“host's table”，host在这里可以是饭店、或是负责提供餐食的部门，host's table也就是所谓的“定价套餐”啦~比如列车上定点派发的套餐就属于这种，乘客只能用餐券来换餐食，不能自由点餐（a meal served to all guests at a stated hour and fixed price）.

The waiter who served us was soaked through. His white jacket was purple under the arms.

"He must drink a lot of wine." "Or wear purple undershirts."

"Let's ask him." "No. He's too tired."

The train stopped for half an hour at Bordeaux (波尔多，法国制造葡萄酒的中心) and we went out through the station for a little walk.

There was not time to get in to the town. Afterward we passed through the Landes (朗德，法国森林地区) and watched the sun set.

There were wide fire-gaps cut through the pines, and you could look up them like avenues and see wooded hills way off.

> <font color=red>There were wide fire-gaps cut through the pines, and you could look up them like avenues and see wooded hills way off.</font>

> 松林中开出一道道宽阔的防火带，望过去像一条条大街，远方尽头处是覆盖着树木的山丘。
>

> ①fire-gap 指“防火带”（不要望文生义理解为“火烧出来的一条道”哦~这里应该理解为a gap which prevents fire from spreading）. 英语里还有很多这样容易在字面上误解的词，比如riot police是指“防暴警察”（police whose job is to stop riots）.
>
> ②way off 表示“距离遥远的”，还可以引申为“完全错误的”（on the wrong track, completely wrong）, 比如：You are way off. You should just give up.（你已经偏离正轨了，赶紧放弃吧。）

About seven-thirty we had dinner and watched the country through the open window in the diner.

It was all sandy pine country full of heather.

There were little clearings with houses in them, and once in a while we passed a sawmill.

It got dark and we could feel the country hot and sandy and dark outside of the window, and about nine o'clock we got into Bayonne (巴荣纳，法国与西班牙交界处的城市).

The man and his wife and Hubert all shook hands with us.

They were going on to La Negresseto change for Biarritz.

"Well, I hope you have lots of luck," he said.

"Be careful about those bull-fights."

"Maybe we'll see you at Biarritz," Hubert said.

We got off with our bags and rod-cases and passed through the dark station and out to the lights and the line of cabs and hotel buses.

There, standing with the hotel runners, was Robert Cohn.

He did not see us at first. Then he started forward.

"Hello, Jake. Have a good trip?"

"Fine," I said. "This is Bill Gorton."

"How are you?" "Come on," said Robert. "I've got a cab."

He was a little near-sighted. I had never noticed it before.

He was looking at Bill, trying to make him out. He was shy, too.

"We'll go up to my hotel. It's all right. It's quite nice."

We got into the cab, and the cabman put the bags up on the seat beside him and climbed up and cracked his whip, and we drove over the dark bridge and into the town.

"I'm awfully glad to meet you," Robert said to Bill. "I've heard so much about you from Jake and I've read your books. Did you get my line, Jake?"

The cab stopped in front of the hotel and we all got out and went in.

It was a nice hotel, and the people at the desk were very cheerful, and we each had a good small room.

### 背景知识

**💧****1. Lourdes 卢尔德**

"They've got seven cars of them from Dayton, Ohio. They've been on a pilgrimage to Rome, and now they're going down to Biarritz and Lourdes."（“他们来自俄亥俄州的达顿，占了七个车厢。他们到罗马朝了圣，现在去比亚里茨和卢尔德。”）

这里提到的火车上的天主教徒们要去朝圣的卢尔德，在之前的内容里其实也出现过。当时Frances在和Cohn闹分手，于是她说自己在咖啡馆前看到了异象（指示她要这么做），而且说不定人们还会在那里立一块碑纪念，就像在卢尔德一样（They've sent it to me in a vision in the Café Select. Isn't it mystic? Some day they'll put a tablet up. Like at Lourdes. — Chapter 6.2）

那么卢尔德是怎么成为朝圣胜地的呢？这里有一个传说。卢尔德原本是法国南部比利牛斯山麓的一座小城，位于法国南部接近西班牙边界的波河（Gave de Pau）的岸边。据说在1858年，14岁的牧羊少女贝尔娜岱特（Bernadette）在一山洞前遇见圣母玛利亚显灵，并且指引她挖开洞穴旁边的地面，得到了有神奇治愈能力的泉水。自此以后人们便相信任何病痛都可以在这里得到治愈，于是每年八月中旬的朝圣期这里都是人山人海，还有东南亚国家的宗教团体来空运圣水回去供信男信女们饮用。

在卢尔德公园的小山上建有一个宏伟的教堂，分上、中、下三层，里面刻有五十多个人的名字，都是喝圣水后长年的残疾得以治愈，如下肢瘫痪喝圣水后就能站起来走路。卢尔德因此变成一个宗教文化旅游城，街上到处是卖装圣水容器的，其中还有将内部掏空，用于装圣水的圣母玛利亚雕像；旅馆备有大量手拉轮椅，接待前来朝圣的残疾旅客。



**💧****2. 三K党**

"It's enough to make a man join the Klan," Bill said. The priest looked back at him.（“这种行径足以逼一个人去投奔三K党了。”比尔说。神父回头盯了他一眼。）

三K党的全称是Ku Klux Kla，一说它们的原始字义是指手枪扳机时三步骤声响，为学习射击时的口诀；也有说这三个字是来自于希腊文，Ku-Klux在希腊文里是Ku Kloo，意为集会，而Klan则是种族的意思。

美国历史上有两个“三K党”，共同点是都是恐怖主义的秘密组织。第一个三K党于1866年由南北战争中被击败的南方邦联军队的退伍老兵组成。在其发展初期，三K党的目标是在美国南部恢复民主党的势力，并反对由联邦军队在南方强制实行的改善旧有黑人奴隶待遇的政策。他们采取的主要是暴力手段，并且到19世纪70年代开始逐渐消亡。

另一个三K党始于1915年，延续至今，新三K党由出生在美国的白人新教徒组成，他们不仅对黑人怀有敌意，而且对天主教徒、犹太人及其他外来少数民族都有偏见。

这里Bill要投奔的显然是新三K党，这是因为他很不满这些天主教徒可以先用上餐，所以激愤之下说出这句话。

### 课文理解

Jake和Bill在火车上遇到了一家美国人，同时火车上还有另外一大群美国人——去比亚里茨和卢尔德朝圣的天主教徒，装满了整整七个车厢（"They've got seven cars of them from Dayton, Ohio. They've been on a pilgrimage to Rome, and now they're going down to Biarritz and Lourdes."）但这些天主教徒提前把第五批之前的餐食都预订完了，令这行人非常恼火——

💧**Clue 1**: These people are annoyed at the pre-booking of the Catholics.



**Evidence 1**: "Say," said Bill, "do you know that gang of Pilgrim Fathers have cornered the dining-car until half past three this afternoon?"

"How do you mean? They can't do a thing like that."

"You try and get seats."

“喂，”比尔说，“那帮清教徒把餐车给包了，要占用到下午三点半，你知道不知道？”

“你说什么？他们不会干出这等事来的。”

“你去试试找两个座吧。”



**Evidence 2**: He buttonholed a priest who was coming back with one of the returning streams of pilgrims.

"When do us Protestants get a chance to eat, father?"

"I don't know anything about it. Haven't you got tickets?"

"It's enough to make a man join the Klan," Bill said. The priest looked back at him.

他强拦住一位领着一行刚吃完饭的清教徒往回走的神父。

“什么时候能轮上我们这些新教徒吃饭，神父？”

“这件事我一点也不清楚。你拿到就餐券没有？”

“这种行径足以逼一个人去投奔三K党，”比尔说。神父回头盯了他一眼。



在昨天的内容里，当Jake和Bill和乘务员说他们要买第一批餐食的时候，乘务员告诉他们只有三点半的第五批了："They're all reserved," the dining-car conductor said. "There will be a fifth service at three-thirty." 把三点半之前的都预定完的，现在看来，正是这些天主教徒们。Jake在得知后表示出了惊讶，而Bill的反应则更加激烈，扬言自己要加入三K党来抵制天主教徒了。



接着在下文里还透露了一个细节，Jake自己也是天主教徒，但他显然并不对此感到庆幸——



💧**Clue 2**: Jake is Catholic but he has no enthusiasm of being one of them.



**Evidence 1**: "It certainly shows you the power of the Catholic Church. It's a pity you boys ain't Catholics. You could get a meal, then, all right."

"I am," I said. "That's what makes me so sore."

“由此可见天主教会的权势。可惜你们两位不是天主教徒。不然你们就吃上饭了。”

“我是天主教徒，”我说。“就因为这样，我才感到这么恼火。”



Jake恼火的真实原因并不是他没有享受作为天主教徒的特殊待遇，因为他本来就无意要成为其中的一员。这一点从他的生活方式和习惯里就可以看出来。天主教徒的生活一般遵循严格的戒律，并且极为注重形式上的虔诚。但Jake追寻的生活方式是纯粹以感官上的享乐为目的的（沉迷酒精、上舞厅等），他不上教堂，也不朝圣，无论怎么看都不像是一个天主教徒。



Bill和Jake对天主教徒的反感和厌恶，多少也透露了他们作为战后迷惘的一代，对传统宗教信仰的怀疑，以及他们自身信仰的缺失。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****美到窒息的欧洲火车线路**

虽然火车上的餐食分配有失公允让我们的主角们非常不悦，但在此之外，他们也颇为惬意地边品酒边欣赏了不少沿途的风景：

We ate the sandwiches and drank the Chablis and watched the country out of the window. The grain was just beginning to ripen and the fields were full of poppies. The pastureland was green, and there were fine trees, and sometimes big rivers and chateaux off in the trees.

我们一边吃三明治、喝夏布利酒，一边观赏窗外的乡间风光。庄稼开始成熟，地里盛开着罂粟花。绿茸茸的牧场，如画的树林。时而闪过大河和掩映在树林之中的古堡。

今天的彩蛋我们就看看欧洲都有哪些闻名世界的绝佳火车线路吧~



\1. Bernina Express, Switzerland

伯尔尼纳快车 瑞士

如果想体验最美的额阿尔卑斯山穿行路线，伯尔尼纳快车无疑是首选。它从瑞士的Chur或者Davos一路出发向南， 翻山越岭，直到意大利北部的Tirano. 

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/778e5dd9dc426779e5b5af7c7387149e-sz_362330.png)



一路上，伯尔尼纳快车仿佛在好莱坞大片中行驶，翻越高达65米的兰德瓦瑟高架桥。高架桥是雷蒂亚铁路和这片联合国教科文组织世界遗产地的标志性建筑。沿途风景变化从白雪皑皑的冰川到随风摇曳的棕榈树。



\2. Glacier Express, Switzerland

冰川特快 瑞士

冰川特快有足够的资本炫耀——途径291座桥梁，91处隧道，从滑雪圣地St.Moritz到Zermatt. 并且它在瑞士境内云集了阿尔卑斯山脉90%以上的著名冰川和冰河谷地，所以搭乘观光列车观赏冰川的线路不下七八条。“火车冰川游”被公认为瑞士旅游的一大特色。

这些列车并不是传统的蒸汽机车，而是特意被漆成鲜红色的现代化电气机车。这主要是为了保护因为全球气候变暖而加速融化的雪山，因为蒸汽火车燃煤后的排放物将破坏山区的自然环境、加剧冰川融化。



\3. Brocken Railway, Germany

布罗肯巴恩铁路线 德国

这一段铁路位于德国中部的Harz国家森林公园附近，从德蕾·安妮·霍妮火车站出发，蜿蜒穿过哈尔茨国家公园，抵达哈尔茨（Harz）山脉最高峰（1,125米），旅程的距离仅为18.9公里。最快的列车只需要用49分钟就可以抵达山顶（The fastest train takes 49 minutes to reach the summit）.



\4. West Highland Line, Britain

西高地线 英国

这铁路线将苏格兰西海岸城市玛雷格与苏格兰最大城市格拉斯哥连接起来。行程90分钟的铁路线周围被湖泊、峡谷、沼泽地和城堡所环绕，到达玛雷格蓝色的海岸边后则可以看到艾格、穆克和拉姆等小岛。而且前往玛雷格途中经过的格伦菲南高架桥就是电影《哈利波特》中霍格沃兹快车镜头的拍摄地哦~

In the morning it was bright, and they were sprinkling the streets of the town, and we all had breakfast in a café.

Bayonne is a nice town. It is like a very clean Spanish town and it is on a big river.

Already, so early in the morning, it was very hot on the bridge across the river.

We walked out on the bridge and then took a walk through the town.

I was not at all sure Mike's rods would come from Scotland in time, so we hunted a tackle store and finally bought a rod for Bill up-stairs over a drygoods store.

> **💧知识拓展**
>
> ①tackle 我们在前面已经介绍过了，也就是指“（一整套的）钓鱼用具”；
>
> ②dry goods 很多人会按照字面理解为“干货”，虽然它的确可以表示晒干或风干的制成品，但跟我们通常意义上的干货不一样。drygood主要指烟草、茶叶以及咖啡豆这一类干货。另外它还可以指“纺织品”（textiles），比如衣服、床单、窗帘等，也可以称作soft goods（这样命名主要是为了和五金店hardware或者杂货店grocery区分开~）

The man who sold the tackle was out, and we had to wait for him to come back.

Finally he came in, and we bought a pretty good rod cheap, and two landing-nets.

We went out into the street again and took a look at the cathedral.

Cohn made some remark about it being a very good example of something or other, I forget what.

It seemed like a nice cathedral, nice and dim, like Spanish churches.

Then we went up past the old fort and out to the local Syndicat d'Initiative (旅游事业联合会) office, where the bus was supposed to start from.

There they told us the bus service did not start until the 1st of July.

We found out at the tourist office what we ought to pay for a motor-car to Pamplona and hired one at a big garage just around the corner from the Municipal Theatre (市剧院) for four hundred francs.

The car was to pick us up at the hotel in forty minutes, and we stopped at the café on the square where we had eaten breakfast, and had a beer.

It was hot, but the town had a cool, fresh, early-morning smell and it was pleasant sitting in the café.

A breeze started to blow, and you could feel that the air came from the sea.

There were pigeons out in the square, and the houses were a yellow, sun-baked color, and I did not want to leave the café.

But we had to go to the hotel to get our bags packed and pay the bill.

We paid for the beers, we matched and I think Cohn paid, and went up to the hotel.

> <font color=red>We paid for the beers, we matched and I think Cohn paid, and went up to the hotel.</font>

> 我们付了啤酒钱（我们抛硬币赌了一下，结果好像是科恩付的钱），之后步行到旅馆。

> match 在这里既不是表示“匹配”也不是“竞争”的意思，它在俚语里指“抛硬币”（to flip or toss (coins) and compare exposed faces），所以这里就是Jake一行人通过抛硬币来决定谁付钱。这种说法比较过时了，现在一般直接说flip/toss a coin.
>
> **💧知识拓展**
>
> 再给大家拓展一下，硬币的正反面是用heads和tails来表示哦~（head其实就表示正面上的“头像”），比如：The captain called heads as usual — and the coin came down tails.（队长像以往一样叫了正面—可硬币反面朝上地落了下来。）

It was only sixteen francs apiece for Bill and me, with ten per cent added for the service, and we had the bags sent down and waited for Robert Cohn.

> ==apiece英 [əˈpi:s] 美 [əˈpis] adv. 每人；每个；每件；各自地==

While we were waiting I saw a cockroach on the parquet floor that must have been at least three inches long.

I pointed him out to Bill and then put my shoe on him. We agreed he must have just come in from the garden.

It was really an awfully clean hotel.

Cohn came down, finally, and we all went out to the car.

It was a big, closed car, with a driver in a white duster with blue collar and cuffs, and we had him put the back of the car down.

He piled in the bags and we started off up the street and out of the town.

We passed some lovely gardens and had a good look back at the town, and then we were out in the country, green and rolling, and the road climbing all the time.

We passed lots of Basques with oxen, or cattle, hauling carts along the road, and nice farmhouses, low roofs, and all white-plastered.

In the Basque country the land all looks very rich and green and the houses and villages look well-off and clean.

Every village had a pelota court and on some of them kids were playing in the hot sun.

There were signs on the walls of the churches saying it was forbidden to play pelota against them, and the houses in the villages had red tiled roofs,

and then the road turned off and commenced to climb and we were going way up close along a hillside, with a valley below and hills stretched off back toward the sea.

You couldn't see the sea. It was too far away.

You could see only hills and more hills, and you knew where the sea was.

We crossed the Spanish frontier.

There was a little stream and a bridge, and Spanish carabineers, with patent-leather Bonaparte hats, and short guns on their backs, on one side, and on the other fat Frenchmen in kepis and mustaches.

They only opened one bag and took the passports in and looked at them.

There was a general store and inn on each side of the line.

The chauffeur had to go in and fill out some papers about the car and we got out and went over to the stream to see if there were any trout.

Bill tried to talk some Spanish to one of the carabineers, but it did not go very well.

Robert Cohn asked, pointing with his finger, if there were any trout in the stream, and the carabineer said yes, but not many.

I asked him if he ever fished, and he said no, that he didn't care for it.

Just then an old man with long, sunburned hair and beard, and clothes that looked as though they were made of gunny-sacking, came striding up to the bridge.

The carabineer waved him back with his sword. The man turned without saying anything, and started back up the white road into Spain.

"What's the matter with the old one?" I asked.

"He hasn't got any passport."

I offered the guard a cigarette. He took it and thanked me.

"What will he do?" I asked.

The guard spat in the dust.

"Oh, he'll just wade across the stream."

"Do you have much smuggling?"

"Oh," he said, "they go through."

The chauffeur came out, folding up the papers and putting them in the inside pocket of his coat.

We all got in the car and it started up the white dusty road into Spain.

For a while the country was much as it had been; then, climbing all the time, we crossed the top of a Col (山坳), the road winding back and forth on itself, and then it was really Spain.

There were long brown mountains and a few pines and far-off forests of beech-trees on some of the mountainsides.

The road went along the summit of the Col and then dropped down, and the driver had to honk, and slow up, and turn out to avoid running into two donkeys that were sleeping in the road.

Down below there were grassy plains and clear streams, and then we crossed a stream and went through a gloomy little village, and started to climb again.

We climbed up and up and crossed another high Col and turned along it, and the road ran down to the right,

and we saw a whole new range of mountains off to the south, all brown and baked-looking and furrowed in strange shapes.

After a while we came out of the mountains, and there were trees along both sides of the road, and a stream and ripe fields of grain, and the road went on, very white and straight ahead,

and then lifted to a little rise, and off on the left was a hill with an old castle, with buildings close around it and a field of grain going right up to the walls and shifting in the wind.

I was up in front with the driver and I turned around. Robert Cohn was asleep, but Bill looked and nodded his head.

Then we crossed a wide plain, and there was a big river off on the right shining in the sun from between the line of trees,

and away off you could see the plateau of Pamplona rising out of the plain, and the walls of the city, and the great brown cathedral, and the broken skyline of the other churches.

> ==plateau英 [ˈplætəʊ] 美 [plæˈtoʊ] n. 高原；平稳时期，稳定水平；停滞期 v. 进入停滞期；达到平稳状态==

In back of the plateau were the mountains, and every way you looked there were other mountains, and ahead the road stretched out white across the plain going toward Pamplona.

### 背景知识

**💧****1. Basque 巴斯克地区**

We passed lots of Basques with oxen, or cattle, hauling carts along the road, and nice farmhouses, low roofs, and all white-plastered.（一路上驶过许许多多赶着牲口或牛车的巴斯克人，还有精致的农舍，屋顶很低，墙壁全部刷白。）

巴斯克地区位于比利牛斯山脉西部，比斯开湾沿岸，地跨西班牙和法国，该地区包括西班牙的巴斯克自治区（Autonomous Communities of the Basque Country）、诺瓦拉自治区（Navarra）和法国的北部巴斯克地区（Northern Basque Country）. 我们之前介绍过的圣塞巴斯蒂安（San Sebastian）就是位于巴斯克地区哦~

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/655431b05a38ede178247b15033f135f-sz_31175.png)



巴斯克人的样貌也与其他欧洲人有明显的不同——面孔狭长，鼻子高挺，肤色微黑，身材中等。一些学者的研究认为，他们不属于印欧人种。在血缘关系上与相邻的西班牙人、法国人及其他欧洲人没有丝毫联系。 “来历不明，家世复杂”是这个民族的一大特点。

与南欧诸国屡次被外族征服的历史不同，巴斯克长期保持自己的独立性，巴斯克人强悍的历史基因在以散漫慵懒著称的南欧性格里被誉为“南欧里的北欧人”，巴斯克语则被称为“上帝的语言”。



**💧****2. Pelota 回力球**

Every village had a pelota court and on some of them kids were playing in the hot sun.（每个村庄都有一片回力球场。在有些球场上，孩子们顶着烈日在玩耍。）

回力球是巴斯克人玩的传统球戏，也被认为是西班牙的“国技”。运动员在三面围墙的球场上，一只手臂戴柳条编织的长勺形手套，将硬橡皮球掷向前墙并接住从前墙弹回的球。

回力球最引人注目的恐怕就是球手戴的手套了，它最早是柳条编织而成的。后来发展成了皮革，从南美洲引进橡胶以后，接球手套被改进成了橡胶材质，可有效地加强球的弹跳能力从而加速球戏。

回力球的体积小于棒球，硬度大于高尔夫球，所以速度也非常快，可以达到时速150-170英里。自1924年引进后，回力球便成为迈阿密最热门的运动，很多人为了看球而去，有的人为了出名而去看球，但如今这项运动已经没落。

### 课文理解

今天的内容情节很简单，Jake, Bill和Cohn出发去西班牙前在巴约讷（Bayonne, 在法国西南的小镇，靠近和西班牙的边界线）简单逛了逛，然后租了一辆车前往潘普洛纳（Pamplona）. 但越是在平淡无奇的故事发展中，越见作者在叙事艺术上的高超技巧。

比如我们在阅读的时候会很自然地代入人物角色，并且不自觉地相信里面展示的所有对话和动作都是真实发生过的。那么作者是如何做到一点呢？首先是作者在叙事上毫无“修饰”或“加工”的痕迹——

💧**Clue 1**: By presenting the events without editing.



**Evidence 1**: Cohn made some remark about it being a very good example of something or other, I forget what. It seemed like a nice cathedral, nice and dim, like Spanish churches.

科恩说，它是什么式教堂的一个非常出色的范例，我记不得是什么式了。这教堂看来很讲究，像西班牙教堂那样精巧而阴暗。

这里所说的教堂是巴约讷当地非常著名的圣玛利亚大教堂，建筑风格为哥特式。其实作者大可不必拐弯抹角，直接点明这是一座什么样的教堂不是更准确吗？为什么要留下模糊不清的叙述呢？我们可以试着想象一下，一个每处细节都清晰完美的故事，虽然无懈可击滴水不漏，但也免不了 有明显的“加工”和“修饰”的味道。而如果尊重事件发生时候的状态，并且去原模原样地展现出来，就更加能有一种真实感（就像一手的资料，虽然会很粗糙凌乱，但也是最贴切事实的）。



另外很重要的一点就是保留一些看起来很鸡毛蒜皮、甚至是毫无必要的细节——

💧**Clue 2**: By preserving trivial details.



**Evidence 1**: The man who sold the tackle was out, and we had to wait for him to come back.Finally he came in, and we bought a pretty good rod cheap, and two landing-nets.

卖钓鱼用具的人出去了，我们只得等他回来。此人终于回来了，我们很便宜地买到一根相当好的钓竿，还买了两张抄网。



**Evidence 1**: Cohn made some remark about it being a very good example of something or other, I forget what. It seemed like a nice cathedral, nice and dim, like Spanish churches.

科恩说，它是什么式教堂的一个非常出色的范例，我记不得是什么式了。这教堂看来很讲究，像西班牙教堂那样精巧而阴暗。

“卖钓鱼用具的人不在店里”这个细节对整个故事来说几乎可以说是完全不必要的，反而还会显得很赘余，甚至有流水账的感觉。但从另一面来想，这个细节也正好证明了故事的真实性（毕竟如果是没有发生过的事情，谁会刻意浪费笔墨去写一堆“废话”呢？）



当然这样的例子在文中还有很多，比如三人吃完早饭后结账的一个细节：

**Evidence 2**: We paid for the beers, we matched and I think Cohn paid, and went up to the hotel.

我们付了啤酒钱（我们抛硬币赌了一下，结果好像是科恩付的钱），之后步行到旅馆。

“结果好像是科恩付的钱”也是一个很模糊的细节。单纯从情节角度考虑，Jake连究竟是不是Cohn付的钱都记不清了，那么这句话有什么作用呢？它创造了一个更贴近真实生活的场景（当Jake在回忆发生过的事情并记录下来的时候，肯定会有不确定的地方），所以这里也是作者试图让读者增加对Jake作为叙述者的信任，同时让整个故事更具可信度。

这里列举的两个方面只是海明威写作技艺里的冰山一角，他的干练、简洁和客观的文风其实就渗透在故事的字里行间，大家也可以多读多品味哦~

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****士兵帽的流行史**

今天的文章里Jake一行人在过境的时候，有一段分别对西班牙和法国哨兵的描写，其中最引人注目的可能就是他们戴的帽子了。Jake提到西班牙马枪骑兵戴的是黑漆皮的波拿巴帽（Spanish carabineers, with patent-leather Bonaparte hats），而这边的法国士兵戴的则是一种平底帽（and on the other fat Frenchmen in kepis）.

其实各个国家的士兵在戴帽子上都有不同的传统和流行趋势，比如英国士兵经常戴的就是一种高筒熊皮帽。那么士兵们的帽子除了修饰外观，还有什么特别的目的和用途呢？今天的彩蛋我们就一起来看看士兵帽的流行史~

\1. Bonaparte hat

波拿巴帽（拿破仑帽）

这种帽子也叫二角帽，考克帽，本来是当地皇族们非常喜欢的饰物。而它之所以又叫波拿巴帽（波拿巴是拿破仑的姓）正是因为后来拿破仑本人非常喜欢戴这种帽子。据说原因是他的身材太矮，这种又高又大的拿破仑帽正好弥补了这一缺陷。

1789年的法国大革命后这种帽子取代三角帽成为流行样式，广泛被欧洲与美国的海、陆军所采用。在许多拿破仑的肖像画中也可以看到身着戎装、头戴双角帽的拿破仑。

如今巴黎荣军院里面还收藏着拿破仑戴的这顶二角帽。



\2. Tricorne

三角帽

三角帽的历史要比上面提到的双角帽（也就是波拿巴帽）早。它发源于欧洲，自17世纪后期盛行至18世纪，在极盛期时不但是一般男性知识份子的标准行头，也是军人戎装的标准配件之一。

除了因为拿破仑的影响力而被双角帽取代外，三角帽的人气逐渐式微的另一个原因是它在佩戴时一般尖角朝前，对于左肩扛枪的士兵们来说会遮挡视线。



\3. Side cap

船形帽

船形帽其实是双角帽在帽形变小、帽边变软后的一种变体，也就是今天的国际帽。船形帽又分为美国式和俄国式，美国式短，俄国式长。戴着美观大方，同时也较好地解决了官兵夏季戴大檐帽太重、太热和不便携带的问题。

（俄式船形帽）

另一个说法是，船形帽的诞生跟空军这一军种的建立有关。因为最初的空军飞行员都是从步兵、骑兵、炮兵等各兵种中选送去学习飞行的。而步兵、骑兵、炮兵的军帽通常都是大沿帽，但戴大沿帽飞行不太方便，飞行时迎面吹来的气流会把它从头上刮跑。另外，通过硬帽檐戴飞行风镜也不方便。

（美国和英国的空军军官）

因此，最早的一种航空帽是无帽檐的轻便小帽。由于这种帽子的形状，能使气流环绕它平稳地流过。所以人们把这种帽子叫作驾驶员帽（flight cap, 这个一般是美国人的叫法）或者干脆称为船形帽。



\4. Beret

贝雷帽

贝雷帽的历史最早可以追溯到15世纪，当时法国西南部的牧羊人曾经喜欢戴一种用棕色羊毛纺织出的圆形无沿软帽。这种帽子戴在头上可以遮风挡雨，脱下来可以擦汗，放在地上当坐垫。

后来，法国和西班牙交界处的巴斯克人也开始戴这种帽子，并被人们称作“巴斯克贝雷帽”。贝雷帽具有便于折叠、不怕挤压、容易携带、美观等优点，还便于外套钢盔。通常作为一些国家军队的别动队、特种部队和空降部队的人员标志，例如：英国红色贝雷帽部队（红魔部队）。

此外，黑色贝雷帽也是以成功掩护敦刻尔克大撤退而闻名于世的英国名帅蒙哥马利（Montgomery, 1887-1976）的独特标志哦~他的帽子上带有两颗帽徽，一颗是将军徽，体现了将帅的至高权威，另一颗是和士兵们一样的装甲兵徽章，表明自己和全体士兵们同在。



\5. Bearskin

熊皮帽

熊皮帽至今有200多年的历史，它象征着英国强盛的军力。但是熊皮帽最早并不是起源于英国，它在17世纪是为欧洲军队里的掷弹兵设计的。当时法国拿破仑的卫队和近卫掷弹骑兵（The Grenadier Guards）戴这种熊皮高帽，以显得更高、更具威慑力。

英国士兵1815年首次获许戴上熊皮帽，以庆祝在滑铁卢战役中击败法国拿破仑卫队。英军把它当作礼服一部分，传承至今。威风凛凛的熊皮帽让人觉得英国皇家卫队高大威猛这和人类早期历史中佩戴狮鬃盔是一个道理。

但熊皮帽一般高三十厘米，重量超过一斤，这也害苦了英国皇家卫队的士兵们。尤其在夏天时，士兵们形容犹如把脑袋伸进烤箱一样。所以几乎每年都会有皇家卫队士兵晕倒的新闻。据说很多士兵为了提高自己的耐热能力，还会去练高温瑜伽。

熊皮帽带来的另一个争议是它的制作通常是一顶帽子需要两头黑熊的皮，因此也遭到动物保护者协会的集体反抗。但是直到2011年，英国国家炮兵队和其他部分才开始停止使用黑熊皮，而以人造皮草代替。

We came into the town on the other side of the plateau, the road slanting up steeply and dustily with shade-trees on both sides, and then levelling out through the new part of town they are building up outside the old walls.

> ==slant英 [slɑ:nt] 美 [slænt] vt.& vi. （使）倾斜，歪斜==

We passed the bull-ring, high and white and concrete-looking in the sun, and then came into the big square by a side street and stopped in front of the Hotel Montoya.

> ==concrete英 [ˈkɒŋkri:t] 美 [ˈkɑ:ŋkri:t] adj. 具体的，有形的，实在的 n. 混凝土；具体物==

The driver helped us down with the bags.

There was a crowd of kids watching the car, and the square was hot, and the trees were green, and the flags hung on their staffs,

and it was good to get out of the sun and under the shade of the arcade that runs all the way around the square.

> ==arcade英 [ɑ:ˈkeɪd] 美 [ɑ:rˈkeɪd] n. 商场，游乐中心；拱廊==

Montoya was glad to see us, and shook hands and gave us good rooms looking out on the square, and then we washed and cleaned up and went down-stairs in the dining-room for lunch.

The driver stayed for lunch, too, and afterward we paid him and he started back to Bayonne.

There are two dining-rooms in the Montoya.

One is up-stairs on the second floor and looks out on the square.

The other is down one floor below the level of the square and has a door that opens on the back street that the bulls pass along when they run through the streets early in the morning on their way to the ring

It is always cool in the down-stairs dining-room and we had a very good lunch.

The first meal in Spain was always a shock with the hors d'oeuvres, an egg course, two meat courses, vegetables, salad, and dessert and fruit.

> course 原义是“进程”，因为西方的饮食习惯是菜一盘一盘地分开上，所以一顿饭吃下来就有好几个courses（一般是五道菜，也就是a five-course meal）, 不像我们是全部上齐了一起吃。
>
> 因此每回上的菜就是一道course. 比如第一道（the first course）就是头盘，一般是开胃菜，英文里叫作appetizer，法国人则会说hors d'oeuvres. 第二道是汤；第三道则会是鱼；到了第四道一般就是主菜（the main course）了，法语里叫作entrée; 之后则是沙拉、甜点和水果之类的。

You have to drink plenty of wine to get it all down.

Robert Cohn tried to say he did not want any of the second meat course, but we would not interpret for him, and so the waitress brought him something else as a replacement, a plate of cold meats, I think.

Cohn had been rather nervous ever since we had met at Bayonne.

He did not know whether we knew Brett had been with him at San Sebastian, and it made him rather awkward.

"Well," I said, "Brett and Mike ought to get in to-night."

"I'm not sure they'll come," Cohn said.

"Why not?" Bill said. "Of course they'll come."

"They're always late," I said.

"I rather think they're not coming," Robert Cohn said.

He said it with an air of superior knowledge that irritated both of us.

> ==irritate英 [ˈɪrɪteɪt] 美 [ˈɪrɪˌtet] vt. & vi. 刺激，使兴奋；使发怒==

"I'll bet you fifty pesetas they're hereto-night," Bill said. He always bets when he is angered, and so he usually bets foolishly.

"I'll take it," Cohn said. "Good. You remember it, Jake. Fifty pesetas."

"I'll remember it myself," Bill said. I saw he was angry and wanted to smooth him down.

"It's a sure thing they'll come," I said. "But maybe not tonight."

"Want to call it off?" Cohn asked.

"No. Why should I? Make it a hundred if you like."

"All right. I'll take that."

"That's enough," I said. "Or you'll have to make a book and give me some of it."

"I'm satisfied," Cohn said. He smiled. "You'll probably win it back at bridge, anyway."

"You haven't got it yet," Bill said.

We went out to walk around under the arcade to the Café Irufla for coffee.

Cohn said he was going over and get a shave.

"Say," Bill said to me, "have I got any chance on that bet?"

"You've got a rotten chance. They've never been on time anywhere. If their money doesn't come it's a cinch they won't get in tonight."

"I was sorry as soon as I opened my mouth. But I had to call him. He's all right, I guess, but where does he get this inside stuff? Mike and Brett fixed it up with us about coming down here."

I saw Cohn coming over across the square.

"Here he comes." "Well, let him not get superior and Jewish."

"The barber shop's closed," Cohn said. "It's not open till four."

We had coffee at the Iruña, sitting in comfortable wicker chairs looking out from the cool of the arcade at the big square.

After a while Bill went to write some letters and Cohn went over to the barber-shop.

It was still closed, so he decided to go up to the hotel and get a bath, and I sat out in front of the café and then went for a walk in the town.

It was very hot, but I kept on the shady side of the streets and went through the market and had a good time seeing the town again.

I went to the Ayuntamiento (市政厅) and found the old gentleman who subscribes for the bull-fight tickets for me every year, and he had gotten the money I sent him from Paris and renewed my subscriptions,so that was all set.

> 💧subscribe 一般表示“订购”，可以指订阅杂志或报刊（to subscribe to a magazine or newspaper）, 也可以是某个网站的会员服务（需要定期缴纳会员费）等。这里的subscribe 是指“提前订票”。

He was the archivist, and all the archives of the town were in his office.

> ==archive英 [ˈɑ:kaɪv] 美 [ˈɑ:rkaɪv] v. 存档 n. 档案文件；档案室==

That has nothing to do with the story. Anyway, his office had a green baize door and a big wooden door,

and when I went out I left him sitting among the archives that covered all the walls, and I shut both the doors, and as I went out of the building into the street the porter stopped me to brush off my coat.

"You must have been in a motor-car," he said.

The back of the collar and the upper part of the shoulders were gray with dust."From Bayonne."

"Well, well," he said. "I knew you were in a motor-car from the way the dust was." So I gave him two copper coins.

At the end of the street I saw the cathedral and walked up toward it.

The first time I ever saw it I thought the facade was ugly but I liked it now. I went inside.

It was dim and dark and the pillars went high up, and there were people praying, and it smelt of incense, and there were some wonderful big windows.

> ==incense英 [ˈɪnsens] 美 ['ɪnsens] n. 香；焚香时的烟；奉承 v. 使愤怒；激怒==

I knelt and started to pray and prayed for everybody I thought of, Brett and Mike and Bill and Robert Cohn and myself, and all the bull-fighters, separately for the ones I liked, and lumping all the rest,

then I prayed for myself again, and while I was praying for myself I found I was getting sleepy,

> ==lump==

> n. 肿块；块，团（a piece of sth hard or solid, usually without a particular shape）
>
> vt. & vi. （使）成团、成块；把……混在一起（to unite into a mass）

> 其余的就一股脑儿地放在一起，然后为自己又祈祷了一遍……
>
> 💧lump 原义是指“（无定形的）块状物”，比如还没捏成形的一块黏土就可以说是a lump of clay; 这里作动词是“（随意、混乱地）搅和在一起”的意思，也就是Jake把自己想祷告的内容全都混在一起胡乱说一通。
>
> 💧关于lump还有一个很生动的俚语表达：to have/with a lump in one's throat，表示“（因为情绪激动而）喉咙哽咽”，比如：I stood therewith a lump in my throat and tried to fight back tears.
>
> 我站在那儿，喉咙哽咽，拼命忍住眼泪。

so I prayed that the bull-fights would be good, and that it would be a fine fiesta, and that we would get some fishing.

I wondered if there was anything else I might pray for and I thought I would like to have some money,

so I prayed that I would make a lot of money, and then I started to think how I would make it, and thinking of making money reminded me of the count,

and I started wondering about where he was, and regretting I hadn't seen him since that night in Montmartre

and about something funny Brett told me about him, and as all the time I was kneeling with my forehead on the wood in front of me,

and was thinking of myself as praying, I was a little ashamed, and regretted that I was such a rotten Catholic

but realized there was nothing I could do about it, at least for a while, and maybe never, but that anyway it was a grand religion, and I only wished I felt religious and maybe I would the next time

and then I was out in the hot sun on the steps of the cathedral, and the forefingers and the thumb of my right hand were still damp, and I felt them dry in the sun.

The sunlight was hot and hard, and I crossed over beside some buildings, and walked back along side streets to the hotel.

At dinner that night we found that Robert Cohn had taken a bath, had had a shave and a haircut and a shampoo, and something put on his hair afterward to make it stay down.

He was nervous, and I did not try to help him any.

The train was due in at nine o'clock from San Sebastian, and, if Brett and Mike were coming, they would be on it. At twenty minutes to nine we were not half through dinner.

Robert Cohn got up from the table and said he would go to the station.

I said I would go with him, just to devil him. Bill said he would be damned if he would leave his dinner. I said we would be right back.

> <font color=red>I said I would go with him, just to devil him.</font>

> devil 是“恶魔，魔鬼”的意思，在这里作动词表示“戏弄，折磨某人”（to annoy, torment sb）. 其实devil的用法非常广泛，而且不只局限于负面的含义，比如英文里的“说曹操，曹操到”就是：speak/talk of the devil. 比如：Well, speak of the devil — here's Alice now!（嗬，说曹操，曹操就到——瞧，艾丽斯这不来啦！）
>
> 以及be a devil这个表达也不是说让一个人去做魔鬼哦~它是用来鼓励对方坚定或者勇敢一点，不要犹豫不决的，比如：Go on, be a devil, buy both of them.（来，怕什么，两个都买了吧！）

**💧****Concierge, porter以及bellboy 有什么区别？**

...and as I went out of the building into the street the porter stopped me to brush off my coat.（正走出大楼要上街的时候，看门人拦住了我，给我刷掉外衣上的尘土。）

这里提到的看门人是porter，我们在前面还见到了concierge这个词（Jake居住的公寓门口的门房太太），其实在英文里还有一个意思非常相近的词：bellboy（也可以写作bellpop），门房的英语这么多，它们之间都有什么区别呢？接下来我们一一来看~

\1. Concierge 

concierge 来自法语，一说是从古法语的cumcerges演变而来，这个词还可以追溯到中世纪的拉丁文consergius, 在英文里的意思是“fellow slave”, 可以理解为“奴仆”。还有说concierge是comte des cierges的缩写，这个短语的意思是“count of candles”，“数蜡烛的人”，也就是中世纪的时候专门负责维护烛火和清洁的仆人。

现在的concierge不是指哪个工种，而是一个部门（礼宾部），一般在比较大型或高档的酒店才会设置这个部门，为客人提供行李、委托代办等服务，一般由行李生、门僮、机场代表、司机班组成（an employee of a multi-tenant building, such as a hotel or apartment building, who receives guests）.



\2. Porter

porter也叫bearer, 从命名就可以知道它主要是指“行李生”（a person who carries objects or cargoes for others）. porter从拉丁文的portare而来，意思就是“to carry”.

行李生的含义范围非常广，比如火车站负责把行李搬运上火车（to shutter luggage aboard）的就是railroad porter; 还有一种是在山区远足（mountaineering expedition）中负责挑运行李的也是porter（这个有点像我们的“挑山工”）。

（Female porter on Mount Kilimanjaro 乞力马扎罗雪山上的女性挑运工）



\3. Bellboy

bellboy 也称为bellpop，这是北美的说法，国际上一般称作hotel porter. 原意是是指酒店门口摇铃当，侍应客人的人，现在一般指行李生，同时帮助客人登记或登出以及搬运行李（who helps patrons with their luggage while checking in or out）.

bellboy一般都身穿特定的制服，其中最有标志性的就是他们的帽子，就叫作bellboy hat (or cap), 长下面这样↓



### 课文理解

三人到达了潘普洛纳（Pamplona），而Cohn则从巴约讷（Bayonne）一路过来都表现得很紧张，Jake很灵敏地察觉到了这一点，但他并不作理，甚至还想戏弄他——

💧**Clue 1**: Jake has no sympathy with Cohn's nervousness.



**Evidence 1**: Cohn had been rather nervous ever since we had met at Bayonne. He did not know whether we knew Brett had been with him at San Sebastian, and it made him rather awkward.

科恩自从巴约讷跟我们会合以来，一直心神不定。他弄不清我们是否知道勃莱特在圣塞瓦斯蒂安曾经和他在一起，此事使他感到尴尬。



**Evidence 2**: He was nervous, and I did not try to help him any...Robert Cohn got up from the table and said he would go to the station. I said I would go with him, just to devil him.

他很紧张，我也不想宽慰他……罗伯特·科恩从饭桌上站起来，说他要到车站去。我存心戏弄他，说要陪他一起去。



我们在前面提到过，从Jake从Brett那里得知她和Cohn一起去了圣塞巴斯蒂安的时候，他就已经把Cohn看成了潜在的对手（rival）——他们会一起争夺Brett. 但除了危机感，Cohn带给Jake的还有另一种情绪：鄙夷和不屑。我们知道从一开始Jake就不是很喜欢Cohn，Cohn性格懦弱，想法不切实际，甚至看起来是很幼稚的（boyish）. 所以在Jake看到Cohn的不安和紧张时反而心生窃喜。

今天的内容里还有一段非常有意思的描述，Jake在街上晃悠的时候正好又走到了天主教堂门前，于是便索性进去祷告（At the end of the street I saw the cathedral and walked up toward it...I knelt and started to pray and prayed for everybody I thought of）. 这里作者采用了我们之前介绍过的“意识流”的写作手法，看起来似乎毫无逻辑不着边际，而且还是一气呵成的足足有196个词的句子（从I wondered if there was anything else I might pray一直到走出教堂I felt them dry in the sun这中间都没有出现句号哦~）

这其实正好印证了Jake虽然身为天主教徒（Catholic），但其实已经抛弃信仰，并且生活的方式和状态也完全和天主教的教义背道而驰（比如他连专心祷告也没法做到）——



💧**Clue 2**: Jake can't even focus on praying.



**Evidence 1**: ...I thought I would like to have some money, so I prayed that I would make a lot of money, and then I started to think how I would make it, and thinking of making money reminded me of the count, and I started wondering about where he was...

想起了我需要点钱，所以我乞求能发一笔大财，接着我开始想该怎样去挣，一想到挣钱，我就联想到伯爵，想到不知道他现在在哪里……



**Evidence 2**: ...I was a little ashamed, and regretted that I was such a rotten Catholic, but realized there was nothing I could do about it, at least for a while, and maybe never, but that anyway it was a grand religion, and I only wished I felt religious and maybe I would the next time...

我感到有点害臊，为自己是一个糟糕透顶的天主教徒而懊悔，但是意识到我自己对此毫无办法，至少在这一阵，或许永远，不过，怎么说天主教还是种伟大的宗教，但愿我有虔敬之心，或许下次来时我会有的……

这一段也足见作者在长句的把握上非常出色，读起来毫无冗赘和拖沓的感觉，大家可以也可以再细细地品味哦~

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****常见的行道树有哪些？**

We came into the town on the other side of the plateau, the road slanting up steeply and dustily with shade-trees on both sides...（我们驶进位于高地另一侧的城市，两侧绿树成荫的公路灰尘扑扑地陡然上升……）

这里提到的shade-trees从字面上来看是指“遮阴的树”，并且是种在路旁的，也就是我们所谓的“行道树”啦~ 行道树的栽种既考虑美观，又要能够在夏日提供阴凉，而且还要根据各地的气候选择合适的树种。那么今天的彩蛋我们就来看看常见的行道树有哪些以及它们一般都出现在哪些地区~

\1. Ginkgo 银杏

Ginkgo也可以写作Gingko（两个词发音是一样的，都读 /ˈɡɪŋkoʊ/）. Ginkgo来自于对日语里的银杏的误拼：gin kyo. 而“银杏”这个名字最早的来源就是中国的《绍兴本草》。

银杏作为世界五大行道树之一，在各国都饱受喜爱。银杏树高大挺拔，叶似扇形。冠大荫状，具有降温作用。叶形古雅，寿命绵长。它还是公认的无公害树种，可自然净化空气，减少大气层悬浮物含量，提高空气质量。

银杏适应性强，对气候土壤要求都很宽范，所以在我国东西南北大部分省区都有栽培。

在国外，银杏不仅被引种到邻近的日本和朝鲜半岛，也飘洋过海在欧美安家。美国华盛顿白宫门前大草坪的一角，就有一棵大银杏，树干需要四人才能合抱，而且它的岁数比白宫存在的年岁还要大。



\2. Linden 椴树 

Linden是椴树的其中一个名字，它在英文里还可以称作lime或basswood. 椴树属植物约有80余种，主要分布在欧洲、美洲和中国。原产于欧洲的椴树被统称为欧洲椴，有欧洲小叶椴、欧洲大叶椴、欧椴和银毛椴等诸多品种，这些品种基本都是世界著名景观树种，在欧洲具有极高的知名度。

中国是全世界椴树种类最多的国家，南北均产，共有30余个品种。先秦时期的辽椴就以"杻"字出现在诗经中，唐朝后，椴树又被称为菩提树，成为佛家圣树，明清以后，椴树作为重要的蜜源树种，生产着皇家贡蜜。虽然椴树在中国有很深的文化渊源，却因"椴"与"断"谐音，听起来不吉利而长期进不得庭院。

\3. Sycamore 悬铃木

悬铃木是落叶大乔木，是悬铃木属植物的通称，包括一球悬铃木(美国梧桐)、二球悬铃木(英国梧桐)、三球悬铃木(法国梧桐)三种。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/85c256f42514d793038c32d2ef0a940b-sz_1301103.JPG?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



悬铃木几乎具有优秀行道树的所有特征。树形高大开展，枝叶繁茂，姿态优美。易繁殖、成活率高、生长迅速，能够迅速成荫。适应性强，不择土壤，具有超强的吸收有害气体、抵抗烟尘、隔离噪音能力。

电影《怦然心动》（Flipped）里面Juli最爱的那棵树就是Sycamore啦！具体的品种就是美国梧桐哦~



\4. Horse chestnut 七叶树

七叶树也叫娑罗树，它的树干挺拔耸立，树形美观，叶片浓绿肥大，冠如华盖，夏绿秋红，别具一格，开花时硕大的白色花序又似一盏华丽的烛台，蔚为奇观。是欧美及日本等地常见的行道树和庭荫树以及园景树。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/5fd4b51ced586e076ea7d639e3946eff-sz_132850.jpeg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



在中国，七叶树与佛教有着很深的渊源，许多古刹名寺都有栽培，如北京卧佛寺、大觉寺中都有千年以上的七叶树。



\5. Chinese Tulip Tree 鹅掌楸

掌楸为古老的孑遗植物，曾有有10余种，现仅残存鹅掌揪和北美鹅掌楸两种。北美鹅掌楸于17世纪从北美引种到英国，其黄色花朵形似杯状的郁金香，故欧洲人称之为"郁金香树"，是城市中极佳的行道树。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/908e237ed5e9bd54a89f826c4e3bf6c6-sz_87189.jpeg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



中国的鹅掌楸叶形如马褂，又叫马褂木，花似郁金香，因此，它的英文名称是"Chinese Tulip Tree"，译成中文就是"中国的郁金香树"。鹅掌楸是中国特有的珍稀植物，国家二级保护植物，因播种出芽率低又屡遭滥伐，在其主要分布区已渐稀少，现已成为濒危树种。

## Chapter 10.3

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/10a4814fccc89263a2ec2f0941dc8e68-sz_357590.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)

We walked to the station. I was enjoying Cohn's nervousness.

I hoped Brett would be on the train.

At the station the train was late, and we sat on a baggage-truck and waited outside in the dark.

I have never seen a man in civil life as nervous as Robert Cohn — nor as eager.

> <font color=red>I have never seen a man in civil life as nervous as Robert Cohn — nor as eager.</font>
>
> 我在非战时的生活中，从没见过一个人像罗伯特·科恩此时这么紧张，这么急切。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> in civil life 在这里指“非战时的生活”，civil有几个基本的含义：
>
> ①“公民的”（relating to all citizens）, 这个义项强调囊括整个国家的公民在内的，比如civil rights是“公民权”，civil war则是“内战”；
>
> ②“平民的”，强调和“普通民众相关的”（ralating to ordinary people）, 主要和“军事的”（military）或“宗教的”（religious）相对，比如：They were married in a civil ceremony in May. 这里就是指非教堂式的婚礼。
>
> ③“民事的”，这个是在法律层面上和“刑事的”（criminal）区分开，比如civil law就是“民法”。
>
> 这里的civil life最恰当的理解是“平民生活”（再具体一点，也就是译文中的“非战时”，因为这个时候正好是一战后）。Jake的语气里其实是对Cohn的调侃（而且Cohn是这本小说的主角里唯一一个没有上过战场的），他对于Mike和Brett到来的紧张程度让人感觉既严肃又可笑。

I was enjoying it. It was lousy to enjoy it, but I felt lousy.

> <font color=red>It was lousy to enjoy it, but I felt lousy.</font>
>
> 这种高兴的情绪是恶劣的，但我的确也感觉到了不适。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> 这里的两个lousy含义是不一样的哦~第一个lousy表示“非常糟糕的”（very awful, terrible）, 比如：The film was lousy!（这部片子真是烂透了！）也就是Jake觉得自己的这种幸灾乐祸的情绪是很不厚道的。
>
> 第二个lousy表示“不适的”（feeling ill, unwell）, 这种不适来源于“他总能在任何人身上唤起最丑恶的本质”（Cohn had a wonderful quality of bringing out the worst in anybody.）

Cohn had a wonderful quality of bringing out the worst in anybody.

After a while we heard the train-whistle way off below on the other side of the plateau, and then we saw the headlight coming up the hill.

We went inside the station and stood with a crowd of people just back of the gates, and the train came in and stopped, and everybody started coming out through the gates.

They were not in the crowd. We waited till everybody had gone through and out of the station and gotten into buses, or taken cabs, or were walking with their friends or relatives through the dark into the town.

"I knew they wouldn't come," Robert said. We were going back to the hotel.

"I thought they might," I said.

Bill was eating fruit when we came in and finishing a bottle of wine.

"Didn't come, eh?" "No."

"Do you mind if I give you that hundred pesetas in the morning, Cohn?" Bill asked. "I haven't changed any money here yet."

"Oh, forget about it," Robert Cohn said. "Let's bet on something else. Can you bet on bull-fights?"

"You could," Bill said, "but you don't need to."

"It would be like betting on the war,"I said. "You don't need any economic interest."

"I'm very curious to see them," Robert said.

Montoya came up to our table. He had a telegram in his hand. "It's for you." He handed it to me.

It read: "Stopped night San Sebastian."

"It's from them," I said. I put it in my pocket. Ordinarily I should have handed it over.

"They've stopped over in San Sebastian," I said. "Send their regards to you."

Why I felt that impulse to devil him I do not know.

Of course I do know. I was blind, unforgivingly jealous of what had happened to him.

> ==unforgivingly英 [ˌʌnfəˈgɪvɪŋli] 美 [ˌʌnfərˈgɪvɪŋli] adv. 记仇地==

The fact that I took it as a matter of course did not alter that any. I certainly did hate him.

I do not think I ever really hated him until he had that little spell of superiority at lunch — that and when he went through all that barbering.

> <font color=red>I do not think I ever really hated him until he had that little spell of superiority at lunch — that and when he went through all that barbering.</font>
>
> 我看，起先我也并不真心恨他，直到他在就餐时表现出那副无所不知的样子——这还不算，还去理发、洗头、搽油什么的闹了一通。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①had that little spell of superiority “表现出那副无所不知的样子”；这里的superiority针对的是当时Cohn语气非常坚定地说Mike和Brett当天晚上一定没法到："I rather think they're not coming," Robert Cohn said. He said it with an air of superior knowledge that irritated both of us.（Chapter 10.2）
>
> spell 本身有“魔法（咒）”的意思，比如童话里经常出现的女巫给某某施了魔咒就是cast a spell on sb, 解除魔咒则是break a spell.
>
> 因此spell也延伸出了“对某人有某种影响力（就好像施了魔咒一样）”（to have control or influence over sb）的意思。这里就是指Cohn的那种无所不知的优越感一直萦绕在Jake的脑海里，让他感觉非常闹心。
>
> ②all that barbering 则是指Cohn和Jake准备去车站看Brett和Mike是否赶上最后一趟火车之前，Cohn精心梳洗打扮了一番：At dinner that night we found that Robert Cohn had taken a bath, had had a shave and a haircut and a shampoo, and something put on his hair afterward to make it stay down.（Chapter 10.2）
>
> barber 除了作名词表示“男理发师”外，还可以直接用来形容“剪发、刮胡子、做造型”这一系列动作（to cut one's hair or trim one's beard）. barbering也可以用hairdressing或grooming来表示哦~

So I put the telegram in my pocket. The telegram came to me, anyway.

"Well," I said. "We ought to pull out on the noon bus for Burguete (布尔戈特，靠近潘普洛纳的一个城镇).They can follow us if they get in to-morrow night."

There were only two trains up from San Sebastian, an early morning train and the one we had just met.

"That sounds like a good idea," Cohn said.

"The sooner we get on the stream the better."

"It's all one to me when we start," Bill said. "The sooner the better."

We sat in the Irufla for a while and had coffee and then took a little walk out to the bull-ring and across the field and under the trees at the edge of the cliff and looked down at the river in the dark, and I turned in early.

> ==ring==
>
> n. 戒指；铃声，钟声；环形物
>
> 拳击场，摔跤台（a small square area surrounded by ropes, where people box or wrestle）
>
> 原文：We sat in the Irufla for a while and had coffee and then took a little walk out to the bull-ring...
>
> 我们在“伊鲁涅”坐了一会儿，喝了咖啡，然后出来走一小段路到了斗牛场……
>
> 💧ring 除了可以指“拳击场，摔跤台”以外，还可以指马戏团的圆形表演场.
>
> 💧ring 另一个和（圆形或方形）场地联系不大的义项是指“团伙，帮派”，并且一般是从事非法活动的（in illegal business or criminal activity）. 比如：Are you aware that a drugsring is being operated in the club?
>
> 你有没有发现俱乐部里有贩毒团伙在活动？

Bill and Cohn stayed out in the café quite late, I believe, because I was asleep when they came in.

In the morning I bought three tickets for the bus to Burguete.

It was scheduled to leave at two o'clock.

There was nothing earlier. I was sitting over at the Irufla reading the papers when I saw Robert Cohn coming across the square.

He came up to the table and sat down in one of the wicker chairs.

"This is a comfortable café," he said. "Did you have a good night, Jake?"

"I slept like a log." "I didn't sleep very well. Bill and I were out late, too."

> <font color=red>"I slept like a log."</font>
>
> “睡得像死过去一样。”
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> sleep like a log 是一句俚语，log本身指“大木头，原木”（a thick piece of wood）, 也就是从树上砍下来后劈好的准备用来烧火的木柴，睡得像木头一样一动不动也就是形容睡得很沉（to sleep soundly）.
>
> **💧知识拓展**
>
> 除了形容睡得像“死木”一样，类似的俚语表达还有sleep like a baby以及sleep like a top哦~ 据考证，sleep like a top可能是莎士比亚本人的原创（在他的《两个高贵的亲戚》里出现），那么top在这里怎么理解呢？
>
> top 其实是指一种玩具——陀螺（也可以叫spinning top）. 陀螺的特点就是在没有外力的情况下（比如鞭、抽、捻、弹等等）是没法自己转起来的，用来形容一个人一睡不起再合适不过啦~

"Where were you?" "Here. And afterit shut we went over to that other café. The old man there speaks German and English."

"The Café Suizo." "That's it. He seems like a nice old fellow. I think it's a better café than this one."

"It's not so good in the daytime," I said. "Too hot. By the way, I got the bus tickets."

"I'm not going up to-day. You and Bill go on ahead." "I've got your ticket."

"Give it to me. I'll get the money back." "It's five pesetas."

Robert Cohn took out a silver five-peseta piece and gave it to me.

"I ought to stay," he said. "You see I'm afraid there's some sort of misunderstanding."

"Why," I said. "They may not come here for three or four days now if they start on parties at San Sebastian."

"That's just it," said Robert. "I'm afraid they expected to meet me at San Sebastian, and that's why they stopped over."

"What makes you think that?" "Well,I wrote suggesting it to Brett."

"Why in hell didn't you stay there and meet them, then?" I started to say, but I stopped. I thought that idea would come to him by itself, but I do not believe it ever did.

He was being confidential now and it was giving him pleasure to be able to talk with the understanding that I knew there was something between him and Brett.

> ==confidential==
>
> adj. 机密的；秘密的（spoken or written in secret and intended to be kept secret）

> 他这是对我讲的知心话，他知道我了解他和勃莱特的底细，所以可以对我吐吐衷肠，这使他很高兴。
>
> 💧confidence 我们介绍过有“机密”的意思，confidences还可以指“掏心窝的话”。由此延伸出的形容词confidential 一般指“机密的”，比如sth is strictly confidential表示“绝对机密的”；
>
> 💧但原文confidential意思稍有不同，表示“信任的，毫无隐藏的吐露”，这里指Cohn在了解Jake知道实情后，就开始把话摊开来说而不是隐隐藏藏的了。

"Well, Bill and I will go up right after lunch," I said.

"I wish I could go. We've been looking forward to this fishing all winter." He was being sentimental about it. "But I ought to stay. I really ought. As soon as they come I'll bring them right up."

"Let's find Bill." "I want to go over to the barber-shop."

"See you at lunch."I found Bill up in his room. He was shaving.

"Oh, yes, he told me all about it last night," Bill said. "He's a great little confider.

He said he had a date with Brett at San Sebastian." "The lying bastard!"

"Oh, no," said Bill. "Don't get sore. Don't get sore at this stage of the trip. How did you ever happen to know this fellow anyway?"

"Don't rub it in."Bill looked around, half-shaved, and then went on talking into the mirror while he lathered his face.

"Didn't you send him with a letter to me in New York last winter? Thank God, I'm a travelling man. Haven't you got some more Jewish friends you could bring along?"

He rubbed his chin with his thumb, looked at it, and then started scraping again.

"You've got some fine ones yourself."

"Oh, yes. I've got some darbs. But not alongside of this Robert Cohn. The funny thing is he's nice, too. I like him. But he's just so awful."

"He can be damn nice." "I know it. That's the terrible part."

I laughed."Yes. Go on and laugh," said Bill. "You weren't out with him last night until two o'clock."

"Was he very bad?" "Awful. What's all this about him and Brett, anyway? Did she ever have anything to do with him?"

He raised his chin up and pulled it from side to side.

"Sure. She went down to San Sebastian with him."

"What a damn-fool thing to do. Why did she do that?"

"She wanted to get out of town and she can't go anywhere alone. She said she thought it would be good for him."

He looked at his face carefully in the glass, put a big dab of lather on each cheek-bone.

he pointed the razor at me — "go west with this face and grow up with the country."

He ducked down to the bowl, rinsed his face with cold water, put on some alcohol, and then looked at himself carefully in the glass, pulling down his long upper lip.

My God. he said, isn't it an awful face?He looked in the glass.

"And as for this Robert Cohn," Bill said, "he makes me sick, and he can go to hell, and I'm damn glad he's staying here so we won't have him fishing with us."

"You're damn right."

"We're going trout-fishing. We're going trout-fishing in the Irati River (伊拉蒂河，布尔戈特附近), and we're going to get tight now at lunch on the wine of the country, and then take a swell bus ride."

"Come on. Let's go over to the Irufla and start," I said.

### 背景知识

**💧****Baggage-truck以及各类推车**

At the station the train was late, and we sat on a baggage-truck and waited outside in the dark.（我们在车站外面的黑地里，坐在推行李的手车上等着。）

这里的baggage-truck可不是装着行李的卡车哦~truck在这里指“手推车，手拉车”（a simple piece of equipment on wheels used to move heavy objects）, 类似这样的↓

这里再给大家介绍几种常见推车的英文~

Wheelbarrow 是独轮或两轮推车，这种要靠手抬起才能推动↓

Dolly 是载重手推车, 这种推车用来短途运东西是最方便的了，既平稳又省力↓

Cart 一般就是指我们逛商场会用到的shopping cart, 最常见的是下面这种↓

Wagon 在美式英语里主要就是指四轮车（一般是体型比较小的），比如美国有一家卖婴儿车的公司就叫作Kinderwagon.

### 课文理解

Cohn和Jake在火车站并没有等来Mike和Brett，结果当然是Cohn赢了打赌，但他似乎兴致全无了（"Oh, forget about it," Robert Cohn said. "Let's bet on something else."）而且第二天还提出自己要留在潘普洛纳（Pamplona）等两位迟到的朋友（"But I ought to stay. I really ought. As soon as they come I'll bring them right up"）.

Jake在这个过程则因为嫉妒心作祟一直和Cohn作对，包括故意用言语刺激他。接下来我们就来看看作者是如何展现这两个角色的心理活动以及他们正在暗中进行的角力——

首先是报复心很强的Jake：

💧**Clue 1**: Jake is quite revengeful.

**Evidence 1**: "I knew they wouldn't come," Robert said. We were going back to the hotel.

"I thought they might," I said.

“我早知道他们是不会来的。”罗伯特说。我们走回旅馆。

“我倒以为他们可能会来的。”我说。



不知道大家是否记得，在Bill和Cohn打赌的时候，Jake可不认为Mike和Brett会准时到达："They're always late," I said. 以及当Bill问他自己是不是打了一个很愚蠢的赌的时候，Jake的回答是："You've got a rotten chance. They've never been on time anywhere. If their money doesn't come it's a cinch they won't get in tonight."

那么这里Jake为什么要特意说"I thought they might"这句话呢？可能的解释就是为了刺激Cohn，因为这里Cohn表现出了相当的失落，并且Jake当时要陪Cohn一起来车站也是带着想戏弄他的心态（I said I would go with him, just to devil him）.

Jake的小心思还不仅如此，我们再来看当他收到Mike和Brett传来的电报时是怎么做的：



**Evidence 2**: "It's from them," I said. I put it in my pocket. Ordinarily I should have handed it over.

“这是他们打来的。”我说，顺手把电报往口袋里一塞。放在平时，我就给大家看了。



关于这里的行为，Jake自己已经给出解释了：I was blind, unforgivingly jealous of what had happened to him. 意思其实就是“不管看起来多盲目还是小心眼，我就是很嫉妒他”。Jake出于不平衡的心理，因为Cohn和Brett已经拥有属于他们的秘密（两人一起去了圣塞巴斯蒂安），所以他也要把这封电报据为己有（虽然的确就是发给他的：The telegram came to me, anyway.）他的目的就是向Cohn“宣示”他和Mike以及Brett俩人也非常亲密（intimate）.

再来看Cohn的心理活动。这一部分并没有直接摊开在纸面上展现（毕竟是从Jake的视角来描述的），但作者还是留下了足够的关键细节来试图向读者“传达”Cohn前后的心路历程，并且我们还会发现，Cohn其实非常单纯并且很容易轻信别人：



💧**Clue 2**: Cohn is liable to trust people.



**Evidence 1**: "That's just it," said Robert. "I'm afraid they expected to meet me at San Sebastian, and that's why they stopped over."

"What makes you think that?"

"Well, I wrote suggesting it to Brett."

“正是如此，”罗伯特说，“我怕他们会指望在圣塞巴斯蒂安同我碰头，因此他们才在那里耽搁下来。”

“你凭什么会这么想？”

“呃，我写信给勃莱特这么提过。”

Cohn一开始面对Jake是非常紧张的，因为他不知道Jake是否知道自己跟Brett之间的事情，但是现在当他提出要在潘普洛纳等Mike和Brett从圣塞巴斯蒂安过来的时候，并没有对原因遮遮掩掩，按照Jake的话说，他现在倒是很坦诚直白了（He was being confidential now）. 那么这个变化是如何发生的呢，我们来看下文Bill透露的一件事：



**Evidence 2**: "Oh, yes, he told me all about it last night," Bill said. "He's a great little confider. He said he had a date with Brett at San Sebastian."

“哦，是的，他昨儿晚上通通告诉我了。”比尔说。“他讲起知心话来可真了不起。他说他曾和勃莱特约定在圣塞巴斯蒂安相会。”

这里的last night其实就是Cohn和Jake一起去车站等Mike和Brett的这天晚上，其实在前面Cohn

已经透露了自己和Bill有过一次“交心”："I didn't sleep very well. Bill and I were out late, too." "Where were you?" "Here. And after it shut we went over to that other café."

到这里我们已经基本可以摸清Cohn的一系列心理变化了：首先他早已经和Brett约定过要在圣塞巴斯蒂安碰面，这也解释了他为什么会那么笃定地跟Bill打赌说Mike和Brett一定不会当晚到（"I rather think they're not coming," Robert Cohn said）. 当然他还顾虑着自己和Brett的那趟秘密之旅到底有没有被公开，所以他还是遮遮掩掩的。

直到在车站没有等来Mike和Brett的时候，这也是意料之中的，他感到了纠结（因为他知道这是因为自己和Brett的约定）。于是这天晚上他就找Bill袒露了自己的秘密（可能Bill在这个时候也向他透露了自己和Jake都已经知道他跟Brett的事），所以第二天他就马上做出自己要留在这里等Mike和Brett的决定。

看完以上分析大家也可以再回顾一遍原文哦~

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****除了失眠，还有哪些睡眠障碍？**

我们在前面介绍了sleep like a log这个表达，也就是“睡得像死木一样”。睡得香又沉当然是一件好事，尤其是现在的人很多都患有失眠症（Insomnia），但有时候“一睡不起”也可能是身体出现毛病的预警哦~比如患上嗜睡症。

今天的彩蛋就来给大家科普一下除了失眠，一般还有哪些常见的睡眠障碍~

\1. Hypersomnia 嗜睡症 

嗜睡症患者不分场合表现为经常困乏思睡，出现不同程度、不可抗拒的入睡。一般分为两种，一种是夜晚睡眠延长（prolonged nighttime sleep），另一种是白天睡意过多（excessive daytime sleepiness）.

嗜睡症带来的危害就是过多的睡眠会引起显著痛苦或职业、社交等社会功能（causing distress and problems with functioning）和生活质量的下降。也会有认知功能方面的改变，表现为近事记忆减退，思维能力下降，学习新事物能力下降。

目前认为导致嗜睡症的原因有相当一部分是心理因素，比如抑郁症患者也极有可能患上嗜睡症（来自潜意识里对现实的逃避，所以通过麻痹大脑进入睡眠来缓解紧张和焦虑）。

\2. Sleep paralysis 睡眠瘫痪

睡眠瘫痪其实就是我们俗话说的“鬼压床”，表现为睡眠处于半睡半醒的状况（half awakening），同时还出现各种各样的幻觉（hallucinations），甚至还能听见周围的声音，但无论自己再怎样用力，却都使不上力来，想大叫也叫不出声，想睁开眼或翻身起床也一动不能动。拼命挣扎醒来后会尤其疲惫甚至满身大汗。

资料显示超过百分之五十的人体验过“睡眠瘫痪症”，科学家已经确定此种症状与生活压力有关，多发于青少年以及年轻人。此类人群通常生活和心理压力过大（psychological distress），作息时间不规律（abnormal sleep cycles），睡眠不足（sleep deprivation）以及经常性焦虑（anxiety）等，这些因素都是可能造成睡眠瘫痪症的原因。



\3. Sleepwalking 梦游症

梦游症俗称“迷症”，是指睡眠中突然爬起来进行活动，而后又睡下，醒后对睡眠期间的活动一无所知。夜游症不是发生在梦中，而是发生在睡眠的第3-4期深睡阶段，此阶段集中于前半夜。故夜游症通常发生在入睡后的前2-3小时。

部分儿童发生梦游症与心理社会因素相关。如日常生活规律紊乱，环境压力，焦虑不安及恐惧情绪；家庭关系不和，亲子关系欠佳，学习紧张及考试成绩不佳等与梦游症的发生有一定的关系。

并且由于梦游症常常发生在睡眠的前1/3深睡期，故各种使睡眠加深的因素，如白天过度劳累、连续几天熬夜引起睡眠不足、睡前服用安眠药物等，均可诱发梦游症的发生。



\4. Sleeptalking 梦呓症

首先梦呓发生在沉睡阶段而不是做梦的阶段：据研究，人睡着后并不表示大脑会完全休息，反而更加活跃。入睡后我们会进入浅睡期（REM, Rapid Eyes Movement），此时会做梦；以及深睡期，此时眼球活动减慢。浅睡期及深睡期两者成一循环，第一个循环时间较短，第二个循环时间较长，到第三个循环的深睡期，则或会有梦游或说梦话的现象。

梦呓症虽然不能算是严格意义上的睡眠障碍，但也在某种程度上反应了可能当前身体健康状况不佳。引起说梦话的原因很多有可能是压力过大、精神紧张诱发的。因此经常说梦话的人一定要加强锻炼，同时更要注意休息,调节工作、生活所带来的压力。

好的睡眠也是给身体的充电，如果出现了以上症状的预警信号一定不要忽视哦~

It was baking hot in the square when we came out after lunch with our bags and the rod-case to go to Burguete (布尔戈特).

People were on top of the bus, and others were climbing up a ladder.

Bill went up and Robert sat beside Bill to save a place for me, and I went back in the hotel to get a couple of bottles of wine to take with us.

When I came out the bus was crowded. Men and women were sitting on all the baggage and boxeson top, and the women all had their fans going in the sun.

It certainly was hot. Robert climbed down and I fitted into the place he had saved on the one wooden seat that ran across the top.

> <font color=red>Robert climbed down and I fitted into the place he had saved on the one wooden seat that ran across the top.</font>

> run across 在这里表示“横跨”，run在这里表示“延伸”（to extend）, 也可以用来形容路或者山脉，比如：The Sierra mountain range runs the length of the north west coast of Majorca.（谢拉山脉横贯马略卡岛西北海岸。） 

Robert Cohn stood in the shade of the arcade waiting for us to start.

A Basque with a big leather wine-bag in his lap lay across the top of the bus in front of our seat, leaning back against our legs.

He offered the wine-skin to Bill and to me, and when I tipped it up to drink he imitated the sound of a klaxon motor-horn so well and so suddenly that I spilled some of the wine, and everybody laughed.

He apologized and made me take another drink.

He made the klaxon again a little later, and it fooled me the second time.

He was very good at it. The Basques (巴斯克人) liked it.

The man next to Bill was talking to him in Spanish and Bill was not getting it, so he offered the man one of the bottles of wine.

The man waved it away. He said it was too hot and he had drunk too much at lunch.

When Bill offered the bottle the second time he took a long drink, and then the bottle went all over that part of the bus.

Every one took a drink very politely,and then they made us cork it up and put it away.

They all wanted us to drink from their leather wine-bottles. They were peasants going up into the hills.

Finally, after a couple more false klaxons, the bus started, and Robert Cohn waved good-by to us, and all the Basques waved good-by to him.

As soon as we started out on the road outside of town it was cool. It felt nice riding high up and close under the trees.

The bus went quite fast and made a good breeze, and as we went out along the road with the dust powdering the trees and down the hill, we had a fine view, back through the trees, of the town rising up from the bluff above the river.

>
> *当然现在一般会更直接地说go to the bathroom.

The Basque lying against my knees pointed out the view with the neck of the wine-bottle, and winked at us.

He nodded his head. "Pretty nice, eh?"

"These Basques are swell people," Bill said.

The Basque lying against my legs was tanned the color of saddle leather.

He wore a black smock like all the rest.

There were wrinkles in his tanned neck.

He turned around and offered his wine-bag to Bill. Bill handed him one of our bottles.

The Basque wagged a forefinger at him and handed the bottle back, slapping in the cork with the palm of his hand.

He shoved the wine-bag up."Arriba! Arriba! ([西]举起来！)" he said. "Lift it up."

Bill raised the wine-skin and let the stream of wine spurt out and into his mouth, his head tipped back.

> ==spurt英 [spɜ:t] 美 [spɜ:rt] vt.& vi. （液体，火焰等）喷出，（使）涌出 n. （怒气，精力等的）迸发;突然喷出==

When he stopped drinking and tipped the leather bottle down a few drops ran down his chin.

"No! No!" several Basques said. "Not like that."

One snatched the bottle away from the owner, who was himself about to give a demonstration.

> ==demonstration英 [ˌdemənˈstreɪʃn] 美 [ˌdɛmənˈstreʃən] n. 示范;证明;游行示威;表露==

"Hey!" the owner of the bottle shouted. "Whose wine is that?"

The drinker waggled his little finger at him and smiled at us with his eyes.

Then he bit the stream off sharp, made a quick lift with the wine-bag and lowered it down to the owner.

> <font color=red>Then he bit the stream off sharp, made a quick lift with the wine-bag and lowered it down to the owner.</font>

>
> 这里的bite off是指刹住、止住酒流（其实就是突然把嘴闭上）；sharp表示“猛地”，比如turn sharp就是指“急转弯”。

He winked at us. The owner shook the wine-skin sadly.

We passed through a town and stopped in front of the posada, and the driver took on several packages.

Then we started on again, and outside the town the road commenced to mount.

We were going through farming country with rocky hills that sloped down into the fields.

The grain-fields went up the hillsides. Now as we went higher there was a wind blowing the grain.

The road was white and dusty, and the dust rose under the wheels and hung in the air behind us.

The road climbed up into the hills and left the rich grain-fields below.

Now there were only patches of grain on the bare hillsides and on each side of the water-courses.

We turned sharply out to the side of the road to give room to pass to a long string of six mules, following one after the other, hauling a high-hooded wagon loaded with freight.

The wagon and the mules were covered with dust.

Close behind was another string of mules and another wagon.

This was loaded with lumber, and the arriero ([西]赶骡人) driving the mules leaned back and put on the thick wooden brakes as we passed.

Up here the country was quite barren and the hills were rocky and hard-baked clay furrowed by the rain.

We came around a curve into a town, and on both sides opened out a sudden green valley.

A stream went through the centre of the town and fields of grapes touched the houses.

The bus stopped in front of a posada and many of the passengers got down, and a lot of the baggage was unstrapped from the roof from under the big tarpaulins and lifted down.

Bill and I got down and went into the posada.

There was a low, dark room with saddles and harness, and hay-forks made of white wood,

> ==saddle英 [ˈsædl] 美 [ˈsædl] n. 马鞍;（自行车或摩托车的）车座==

and clusters of canvas rope-soled shoes and hams and slabs of bacon and white garlics and long sausages hanging from the roof.

It was cool and dusky, and we stood in front of a long wooden counter with two women behind it serving drinks.

Behind them were shelves stacked with supplies and goods.

We each had an aguardiente (土酿白兰地) and paid forty centimes for the two drinks.

I gave the woman fifty centimes to make a tip, and she gave me back the copper piece, thinking I had misunderstood the price.

Two of our Basques came in and insisted on buying a drink.

So they bought a drink and then we bought a drink, and then they slapped us on the back and bought another drink.

Then we bought, and then we all went out into the sunlight and the heat, and climbed back on top of the bus.

There was plenty of room now for every one to sit on the seat, and the Basque who had been lying on the tin roof now sat between us.

The woman who had been serving drinks came out wiping her hands on her apron and talked to somebody inside the bus.

Then the driver came out swinging two flat leather mailpouches and climbed up, and everybody waving we started off.

### 背景知识

**💧****Spanish hams (Jamón) 西班牙火腿**

大巴在中途停在了一个旅馆门前，Jake便走进去买酒喝，这里的描述中提到了在屋顶上挂着的除了一串串绳底帆布鞋（clusters of canvas rope-soled shoes）, 还有hams（火腿）这种食物。火腿其实可以算是西班牙的一大在世界范围内都闻名的特产了，尤其是那种整根连蹄带骨的生火腿（也被看作是这个国家的象征图腾）。

火腿在西班牙语里是“Jamón”（音“哈蒙”），虽然中文译成了“火腿”，但其实它跟我们传统认知里的火腿并不是同一种类型。中国的火腿在制造过程中会用到烟或者火来加工猪肉，但西班牙火腿采用盐腌风干，并非熟肉，而且为了防止氧化，在发酵初期就会给火腿抹上猪油，因此西班牙的火腿是可以生吃的。

还有一点需要注意的是，Jamón是用猪的后腿（the hind leg）制成，如果是用猪的前腿（the front leg）制作的呢，则叫Paleta. 最著名的Jamón生产地，是在西班牙南部的安达卢西亚省内的一个叫乌爱巴的小县城内。乌爱巴制作Jamón的历史悠久，早在罗马时代就开始研究和制作。

除了火腿本身的美味，观看厨师切片也是一种顶级享受，火腿最常见的吃法是切片生食，也可搭配面包制成三明治，火腿配蜜瓜也是地中海地区的一道特色菜肴。

一般切肉师傅有一套专门工具：一个架子，数把肉刀。衡量切肉师傅的技术的标准就是看谁切得薄，面积大小要绝对均匀。



### 课文理解

今天的内容重点在于对西班牙巴斯克这一片地区的风景和民风的展现。Jake和Bill告别Cohn坐上了大巴准备前往布尔戈特（Burguete）钓鱼，大巴上拥挤着当地的巴斯克人（the Basques）, 他们大部分是农民（They were peasants going up into the hills）, 心思简单淳朴，并且待人大方热情。

如果说在巴黎的故事色彩是灰色的，那么进入这一部分则突然敞亮鲜艳了起来。作者在笔调上也更为生动轻快。我们来看两个Jake和Bill以及当地人非常有意思的互动——



💧**Clue 1**: The Basque teases Jake but in a kind way.



**Evidence 1**: He offered the wine-skin to Bill and to me, and when I tipped it up to drink he imitated the sound of a klaxon motor-horn so well and so suddenly that I spilled some of the wine, and everybody laughed.

他把酒袋递给比尔和我，我把酒袋倒过来正要喝的当儿，他模仿汽车电喇叭，嘟嘟的叫了一声，学得那么逼真而且来得那么突然，使我把酒泼掉了一些，大家哈哈大笑。



**Evidence 2**: He apologized and made me take another drink. He made the klaxon again a little later, and it fooled me the second time. He was very good at it.

他表示歉意，让我再喝一次。一会儿他又学了一遍，我再次上当。他学得真是像极了。



这位巴斯克人和Jake以及Bill并不相识，但非常热情地主动和他们分享自己的酒袋，虽然最后不无善意地捉弄了Jake一番。



💧**Clue 2**: Another Basque shows Bill how to drink from a wine-skin properly.



**Evidence 1**: "No! No!" several Basques said. "Not like that." One snatched the bottle away from the owner, who was himself about to give a demonstration.

“不对！不对！”有几个巴斯克人说。“不是那么喝的。”酒袋的主人正要亲自给别尔做示范，另一个人从他手里把它抢过去了。



**Evidence 2**: "Hey!" the owner of the bottle shouted. "Whose wine is that?"

The drinker waggled his little finger at him and smiled at us with his eyes. 

“嗨！”酒袋的主人喊道。“你喝的是谁的酒啊？”

喝酒的小伙用小手指对他点点，眼睛里带着笑意，看看我们。



Bill不会巴斯克人那一套用酒袋喝酒的方法，喝罢下巴上还留着几滴（When he stopped drinking and tipped the leather bottle down a few drops ran down his chin）, 这时候另一个巴斯克年轻小伙抢着要给他示范。正当他喝得酣畅痛快的时候，酒袋的主人便半玩笑半认真地抱怨了一句，这个年轻人腼腆地马上止住。



如果和之前发生在巴黎的人物对话进行比较，大家会发现这里作者着重刻画了巴斯克人在日常交往中的坦诚和直接（比如这里酒袋的主人和另一个巴斯克小伙的对话），并且人物的所有反应都是真实并且毫无掩饰和隐藏的。那么这片土地以及接下来的旅途又会对我们的主角们带来什么影响和改变呢？在接下来的内容里作者会为我们慢慢揭晓。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****葡萄酒瓶的演变历史** 

Jake和Bill在出发前，坐在大巴上和巴斯克人一起喝酒，不知道大家有没有留意到他们用来装葡萄酒的容器叫作wine-skin呢？这里skin指的是一种用羊皮做成的酒囊。这种酒囊携带方便，并且相对玻璃来说造价更便宜。



其实在玻璃瓶普及之前，盛装红酒的容器也经历了漫长的演变历史，今天的彩蛋我们就一起来看一看~



\1. Kvevri 奎弗瑞陶罐

奎弗瑞（Kvevri）是一种蛋形的大型陶罐（earthenware），是目前已知最早用于盛装葡萄酒的容器，距今已有5000多年的历史。它最早是用于发酵和熟成传统的格鲁吉亚葡萄酒（traditional Georgian wine）. 虽然和古希腊罗马时期的双耳细颈陶罐（Amphorae）（我们在下面会介绍到~）在功能和材质上存在相似性，但奎弗瑞没有前者方便运输的握柄。

陶罐的优点是具有透气性，这意味着酒液在发酵和熟成的过程中都会接触氧气，氧化程度高，酿出的葡萄酒颜色也会更深。在发酵和熟成葡萄酒的过程中，奎弗瑞会被埋在地下（buried below ground）. 这一做法在格鲁吉亚延续至今。



2.Amphora 双耳瓶

罗马人对陶罐进行了改造，发明了双耳瓶（Amphora）作为储存、运输葡萄酒的器皿，并将双耳瓶推广开来。双耳细颈瓶虽然外形不错，但是出奇得沉重，运输不便，而且粘土材料影响酒的味道。

当年凯撒大帝率军出征高卢，一路用葡萄酒搞赏军土，提振士气。20世纪，有人在法国南部的Narbonne市一个古罗马军营遗址处进行发掘，揭开一座小山的表土层后赫然发现，所谓的“山”其实是用数万个双耳瓶堆出来的。由此可以看出当年的罗马大军消耗了多少葡萄酒。



 \3. Oak barrel 橡木桶

橡木桶（Oak barrel）最早是用来储存和运输（storage and transportation）货物的。因为其材料易得、方便运输等特性，所以在公元2世纪开始逐渐取代陶罐，成为主流。

橡木的还可以让酒具有独特的风味（impart various qualities to wine）. 比如它的透气性可以使酒液发生适当的氧化效应，从而使葡萄酒口感更加圆熟饱满；烘烤过的橡木还会为葡萄酒带来独特的香气。同时，橡木桶营造的微氧环境有利于色素和单宁的聚合反应，使酒液的色泽更加鲜明和稳定。

如果在酒瓶上看到“Barrel Fermented”的字样就知道这瓶酒是用橡木桶酿造的啦~



\4. Wineskin (Bota bag) 酒囊

原文中出现的wineskin也叫bota bag, 这是西班牙（巴斯克地区）传统的一种盛装液体的容器（a liquid receptacle）. 一般由动物皮革制成（尤其是山羊皮）。

直到17世纪玻璃工艺成熟之前，这种羊皮酒囊都非常盛行。



\5. Glass bottle 玻璃瓶

虽然玻璃瓶在今天看来再寻常不过，当它的诞生在当时非同凡响。通过玻璃瓶和软木塞的结合，葡萄酒得到了更好的储存 ，其意义不亚于保存人类文化的印刷术的发明。最早由于技术所限，玻璃瓶身多为不规则的球形或洋葱形。随着工艺技术的不断提高，酒瓶造型才逐渐接近今天的形制。

为了使酒能水平放置，便于酒的熟化，瓶子逐渐由开始的圆肚形演化成了今天的细长瓶型。不同的葡萄酒产区使用的瓶型也各具特色，比如瓶肩的倾斜角度也会因不同形式风格的酒而有不同。但红酒瓶的颜色一般都是深绿色或深棕色，为的是防紫外线。因为紫外线会加速葡萄酒的分子运动，破坏酒体的稳定性。

The road left the green valley at once, and we were up in the hills again.

Bill and the wine-bottle Basque were having a conversation.

A man leaned over from the other side of the seat and asked in English:

"You're Americans?" "Sure."

"I been there," he said. "Forty years ago."

He was an old man, as brown as the others, with the stubble of a white beard.

"How was it?" "What you say?"

"How was America?" "Oh, I was in California. It was fine."

"Why did you leave?" "What you say?"

"Why did you come back here?" "Oh! I came back to get married.

I was going to go back but my wife she don't like to travel. Where you from?"

"Kansas City." "I been there," he said.

"I been in Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Denver, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City."

He named them carefully."How long were you over?"

"Fifteen years. Then I come back and got married."

"Have a drink?" "All right," he said. "You can't get this in America, eh?"

"There's plenty if you can pay for it."

"What you come over here for?"

"We're going to the fiesta at Pamplona."

"You like the bull-fights?" "Sure. Don't you?"

"Yes," he said. "I guess I like them."

Then after a little:"Where you go now?" "Up to Burguete to fish."

"Well," he said, "I hope you catch something."

He shook hands and turned around to the back seat again.

The other Basques had been impressed.

He sat back comfortably and smiled at me when I turned around to look at the country.

But the effort of talking American seemed to have tired him.

He did not say anything after that.

The bus climbed steadily up the road.

The country was barren and rocks stuck up through the clay.

There was no grass beside the road.

Looking back we could see the country spread out below.

Far back the fields were squares of green and brown on the hillsides.

Making the horizon were the brown mountains.

They were strangely shaped.

As we climbed higher the horizon kept changing.

As the bus ground slowly up the road we could see other mountains coming up in the south.

> ②other mountains coming up in the south 形容的就是随着汽车往上攀登，南边的山峦也慢慢出现在视野中（rising on the horizon）.

Then the road came over the crest, flattened out, and went into a forest.

It was a forest of cork oaks, and the sun came through the trees in patches, and there were cattle grazing back in the trees.

We went through the forest and the road came out and turned along a rise of land, and out ahead of us was a rolling green plain, with dark mountains beyond it.

These were not like the brown, heat-baked mountains we had left behind.

These were wooded and there were clouds coming down from them.

The green plain stretched off.

It was cut by fences and the white of the road showed through the trunks of a double line of trees that crossed the plain toward the north.

As we came to the edge of the rise we saw the red roofs and white houses of Burguete ahead strung out on the plain,

and away off on the shoulder of the first dark mountain was the gray metal-sheathed roof of the monastery of Roncesvalles (龙赛斯瓦利斯，潘普洛纳东北方向的一个小镇).

"There's Roncevaux (Roncesvalles的法语名)," I said.

"Where?" "Way off there where the mountain starts."

"It's cold up here," Bill said.

"It's high," I said. "It must be twelve hundred metres."

"It's awful cold," Bill said.

The bus levelled down onto the straight line of road that ran to Burguete.

We passed a crossroads and crossed a bridge over a stream.

The houses of Burguete were along both sides of the road.

There were no side-streets. We passed the church and the schoolyard, and the bus stopped.

We got down and the driver handed down our bags and the rod-case.

A carabineer in his cocked hat and yellow leather cross-straps came up.

"What's in there?" he pointed to the rod-case.

I opened it and showed him.

He asked to see our fishing permits and I got them out.

He looked at the date and then waved us on.

"Is that all right?" I asked."Yes. Of course."

We went up the street, past the whitewashed stone houses, families sitting in their doorways watching us, to the inn.

The fat woman who ran the inn came out from the kitchen and shook hands with us.

She took off her spectacles, wiped them, and put them on again.

It was cold in the inn and the wind was starting to blow outside.

The woman sent a girl up-stairs with us to show the room.

There were two beds, a washstand, a clothes-chest, and a big, framed steel-engraving of Nuestra Señora de Roncesvalles (龙赛斯瓦利斯圣母).

The wind was blowing against the shutters.

> ==shutter英 [ˈʃʌtə(r)] 美 [ˈʃʌtɚ] n. 快门;百叶窗;遮光器==

The room was on the north side of the inn.

We washed, put on sweaters, and came down-stairs into the dining-room.

It had a stone floor, low ceiling, and was oak panelled.

The shutters were all up and it was so cold you could see your breath.

"My God!" said Bill. "It can't be this cold to-morrow. I'm not going to wade a stream in this weather."

> ==wade英 [weɪd] 美 [weɪd] vt.& vi. 跋涉;（从水、泥等）蹚，走过==

There was an upright piano in the far corner of the room beyond the wooden tables and Bill went over and started to play.

"I got to keep warm," he said.

I went out to find the woman and ask her how much the room and board was.

She put her hands under her apron and looked away from me.

"Twelve pesetas." "Why, we only paid that in Pamplona."

She did not say anything, just took off her glasses and wiped them on her apron.

"That's too much," I said. "We didn't pay more than that at a big hotel."

"We've put in a bathroom."

"Haven't you got anything cheaper?"

"Not in the summer. Now is the big season."

We were the only people in the inn. Well, I thought, it's only a few days.

"Is the wine included?" "Oh, yes."

"Well," I said. "It's all right."

I went back to Bill. He blew his breath at me to show how cold it was, and went on playing.

I sat at one of the tables and looked at the pictures on the wall.

There was one panel of rabbits, dead, one of pheasants, also dead, and one panel of dead ducks.

> ==panel英 [ˈpænl] 美 [ˈpænəl] n. 镶板;面;（门、墙等上面的）嵌板==

The panels were all dark and smoky-looking.

There was a cupboard full of liqueurbottles.

I looked at them all. Bill was still playing.

"How about a hot rum punch?" he said."This isn't going to keep me warm permanently."

I went out and told the woman what a rum punch was and how to make it.

In a few minutes a girl brought a stone pitcher, steaming, into the room.

Bill came over from the piano and we drank the hot punch and listened to the wind.

"There isn't too much rum in that."

I went over to the cupboard and brought the rum bottle and poured ahalf-tumblerful into the pitcher.

"Direct action," said Bill. "It beats legislation."

> ==legislation英 [ˌledʒɪsˈleɪʃn] 美 [ˌlɛdʒɪˈsleʃən] n. 立法，制定法律;法律，法规==

The girl came in and laid the table for supper.

"It blows like hell up here," Bill said.

The girl brought in a big bowl of hot vegetable soup and the wine.

We had fried trout afterward and some sort of a stew and a big bowl full of wild strawberries.

We did not lose money on the wine,and the girl was shy but nice about bringing it.

The old woman looked in once and counted the empty bottles.

After supper we went up-stairs and smoked and read in bed to keep warm.

Once in the night I woke and heard the wind blowing.

It felt good to be warm and in bed.

### 背景知识

**💧****法国传奇英雄罗兰**

...and away off on the shoulder of the first dark mountain was the gray metal-sheathed roof of the monastery of Roncesvalles.（在远处第一座黛色的山岗上，闪现出龙赛斯瓦利斯的修道院的灰色铁皮房顶。）

这里提到了西班牙巴斯克地区的一个地方——龙赛斯瓦利斯Roncesvalles（在法语中名称为Roncevaux）. 龙赛斯瓦利斯处于比利牛斯山脉南麓一个山隘旁边，在潘普洛纳的东北。这里曾经发生过一场著名的战役。公元778年，法兰克王国的查理曼进军西班牙和伊斯兰教王打仗。在回法途中，其后卫部队在龙赛斯瓦利斯附近河谷遭到山地土著居民的袭击。传说中的英雄罗兰在此役中战死。

据说这座修道院里面还有罗兰的遗物，由此也称为著名的朝圣地。

罗兰（Roland）是当时查理曼大帝（Charlemagne the Great）麾下的12圣骑士的首席骑士，史上第一位被称作“帕拉丁（即圣骑士）”的人。拥有无可挑剔的美德。法兰西时代可与亚瑟王相比的骑士。为短暂而辉煌的查理曼帝国的创立立下了不朽的功勋。

但罗兰作为文学作品中的重要象征，已经超过了他在历史当中的地位。他代表的是一种传奇式的英雄形象（所谓的“骑士精神”的彰显）——虔信宗教、忠君爱国、勇敢坚强、珍视友谊。另外扑克牌里的方块J（J即Jack，表示“侍从”）其实就是罗兰骑士本人哦~

罗兰手里握着的是一把“神剑”（Durandal “迪朗达尔”），有“恒久不变”之意。据说罗兰是从天使那里得来了这把剑，天使要他献给国王，罗兰照办了。查理曼大帝有感于他的诚实，就把此剑赐给他，命他守护在自己身边，而罗兰也发誓永远效忠于国王。

### 课文理解

Jake和Bill在到达布尔戈特（Burguete）后住进了一家小旅馆里，除了天气非常寒冷以外，让他们心生不快的还有另一件事，就是旅馆的老板以旺季为由向他们收取了高价的费用。这一段的人物互动也有非常值得琢磨的地方，比如语言留白处入木三分的动作描写——

💧**Clue 1**: Dialogue is more than what's said in conversation.

**Evidence 1**: I went out to find the woman and ask her how much the room and board was. She put her hands under her apron and looked away from me.

"Twelve pesetas."

我出去找女掌柜，问她食宿费每天要多少。她把双手插在围裙下面，连望也不望我一眼。

“十二比塞塔。”

**Evidence 2**: "Why, we only paid that in Pamplona."

She did not say anything, just took off her glasses and wiped them on her apron.

“怎么，在潘普洛纳我们也只花这么多钱。”

她不做声，光是摘下她的眼镜，在围裙上擦着。

这一段也足见作者在长句的把握上非常出色，读起来毫无冗赘和拖沓的感觉，大家可以也可以再细细地品味哦~

在海明威看来，所谓的“人物对话”不仅仅是语言上的，更多的是没有说出来的那部分（通过肢体动作或表情来表达的）：Dialogue is more than what is said between characters in conversation; dialogue is what's not said. 比如这里女掌柜“手插围裙”以及“擦眼镜”的动作都透露出了她逃避躲闪的心态（知道自己做的是不诚信的生意）。

面对自己遭遇的不公，Jake虽然表面上不做声响，但却暗暗地找到了补偿，或者说是让自己心理平衡的方法——

💧**Clue 2**: Jake tries to compensate for the overcharging.



**Evidence 1**: "There isn't too much rum in that."

I went over to the cupboard and brought the rum bottle and poured a half-tumblerful into the pitcher.

"Direct action," said Bill. "It beats legislation."

“这里头没多少朗姆酒啊。”

我走到食柜前，拿了一瓶朗姆酒，往酒罐里倒了半杯。

“好一个直接行动，”比尔说。“比申请批准强啊。”



**Evidence 2**: We did not lose money on the wine, and the girl was shy but nice about bringing it. The old woman looked in once and counted the empty bottles.

我们在酒钱上没吃亏。女孩很腼腆，但是愿意给我们拿酒。老太太来看过一次，数了数空酒瓶。



“补偿”（compensation）这个主题其实贯穿了整个小说。比如这里Jake因为被敲竹杠心有不甘，于是在酒水上想要得到补偿（可以推测酒水钱应该是包含在房费里的）。但与之形成对比的是，尽管这一件小事上Jake找到了平衡，但在其他更重要的方面，他却深刻意识到生活其实没有公平而言（比如就他参战受伤这件事）。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****海明威的写作忠告**

在这几天的课文理解当中我们分析了不少海明威的写作理念和手法。海明威作为20世纪最著名的小说家之一，影响了后来不少作家的写作风格，比如《麦田里的守望者》的作者J. D. 塞林格。

海明威本人深得简洁优美文风的创作要领，而simplicity也可以说是英语这门语言在写作中的灵魂所在了。所以今天的彩蛋就为大家准备了海明威对于写作这件事的一些金玉良言，希望对大家也有一定的帮助哦~



\1. Cut Out the Ornamentation

去掉所有的修饰

"If I started to write elaborately, or like someone introducing or presenting something, I found that I could cut that scrollwork or ornament out and throw it away and start with the first true simple declarative sentence I had written."

“一旦我开始要添枝加叶地修饰句子，就像一个人在介绍或者展示某个东西，我就会发现我其实可以把那些花里胡哨的东西都去掉，然后重新从我起初写的最简单的陈述句开始写起。”

海明威提倡用最简单的词汇表达最复杂的内容，比如他喜欢用基本词汇、简短句式等表达具体含义，用名词、动词来揭示事物的本来面目，丝毫无矫揉造作之感。在海明威看来，写作者完全没有必要用文字修饰雕琢来哗众取宠，只要将事物描述清楚就行。



\2. Don’t Repeat Yourself

不要重复自己

"This book began magnificently, went on very well for a long way with great stretches of great brilliance and then went on endlessly in repetitions that a more conscientious and less lazy writer would have put in the waste basket."

“试想一本书有一个非常棒的开头，并且中间的部分也写得精彩绝伦，但是之后的内容就变成了没完没了的重复……一个稍微有点良心，或者说没那么懒惰的作家，是绝对不会这么做的；相反，他会这些全部都撕下来扔到垃圾篓里。”



\3. After You Write, Read

把自己写的读一遍

“When I was writing, it was necessary for me to read after I had written. If you kept thinking about it, you would lose the thing that you were writing before you could go on with it the next day.”

“当我在写作的时候，把自己写的东西再读一遍是必不可少的环节。如果你只是去想，而不是去读的话，你很容易搞混一些东西，比如丢了关键的线索等，这样第二天你就没法继续往下写了。”



\4. Never Empty the Well of Your Writing

不要一下子就把才思用完

"I had learned already never to empty the well of my writing, but always to stop when there was still something there in the deep part of the well, and let it refill at night from the springs that fed it."

“我早就学会的一件事是：永远不要一下子就榨干了自己的才思。每当我感觉自己的创作灵感里还有更多可以挖掘的时候，我都会停下来，并且等待它再一次充盈。”



\5.  Let the Pressure Build

给自己一些压力

"When I had to write it, then it would be the only thing to do and there would be no choice. Let the pressure build. In the meantime I would write a long story about whatever I knew best."

“当我不得不写作的时候，那么我会把它作为当下我唯一要完成的事，并且不给自己其他选择的余地。给自己一些压力。与此同时，我也将完成比以往任何一篇都要精彩的故事。”

## Chapter 12.1

When I woke in the morning I went to the window and looked out.

It had cleared and there were no clouds on the mountains.

Outside under the window were some carts and an old diligence, the wood of the roof cracked and split by the weather.

It must have been left from the days before the motor-buses.

A goat hopped up on one of the carts and then to the roof of the diligence (旧时的驿马车).

He jerked his head at the other goats below and when I waved at him he bounded down.

Bill was still sleeping, so I dressed, put on my shoes outside in the hall, and went down-stairs.

No one was stirring down-stairs, so I unbolted the door and went out.

> ==unbolt英 ['ʌn'bəʊlt] 美 [ʌn'boʊlt] vt. 拔去门闩，打开==

It was cool outside in the early morning and the sun had not yet dried the dew that had come when the wind died down.

I hunted around in the shed behind the inn and found a sort of mattock, and went down toward the stream to try and dig some worms for bait.

The stream was clear and shallow but it did not look trouty.

> ==trouty英 ['traʊtɪ] 美 ['traʊtɪ] adj. （江、河等）鲑（鳟）鱼很多的==

On the grassy bank where it was damp I drove the mattock into the earth and loosened a chunk of sod.

There were worms underneath. They slid out of sight as I lifted the sod and I dug carefully and got a good many.

Digging at the edge of the damp ground I filled two empty tobacco-tins with worms and sifted dirt onto them.

> ==sift英 [sɪft] 美 [sɪft] vt. 撒；筛分；精选；审查 vi. 筛；细查==

The goats watched me dig.

When I went back into the inn the woman was down in the kitchen, and I asked her to get coffee for us,and that we wanted a lunch.

Bill was awake and sitting on the edge of the bed.

"I saw you out of the window," he said.

"Didn't want to interrupt you. What were you doing? Burying your money?"

"You lazy bum!"

"Been working for the common good? Splendid. I want you to do that every morning."

> <font color=red>"Been working for the common good? Splendid. I want you to do that every morning."</font>

> common good 原本是哲学、经济学以及政治科学当中的一个概念，也可以称作commonwealth或general welfare, 表示“共同利益”（the advantage of everyone）. 这里的“为我们的共同利益卖力”是指Jake去抓鱼饵来给俩人的钓鱼作准备。

"Come on," I said. "Get up."

"What? Get up? I never get up."

He climbed into bed and pulled the sheet up to his chin.

"Try and argue me into getting up."

I went on looking for the tackle and putting it all together in the tackle-bag.

"Aren't you interested?" Bill asked.

"I'm going down and eat."

"Eat? Why didn't you say eat? I thought you just wanted me to get up for fun.

Eat? Fine. Now you're reasonable. You go out and dig some more worms and I'll be right down."

"Oh, go to hell!"

"Work for the good of all." Bill stepped into his underclothes. "Show irony and pity."

I started out of the room with the tackle-bag, the nets, and the rod-case.

"Hey! come back!"I put my head in the door.

"Aren't you going to show a little irony and pity?"

I thumbed my nose."That's not irony."

> <font color=red> I thumbed my nose.</font>
>
> 我用拇指顶在鼻尖上，冲着他做了个轻蔑的手势。
>
> **💧表达精讲**

> thumb one's nose 字面上的意思就是“把拇指顶在鼻尖上”，这个动作一般表示“轻蔑”（to show contempt or lack of respect）.

> 不过现在我们说thumb one's nose at sb的时候，一般没有实际的动作，而只是形容“（公开地）挑战某人的权威，表示不屑”，比如：Don'tthumb your nose at the boss if you want to keep your job!（如果你不想丢了工作的话，就别对你的老板一副嗤之以鼻的样子！）

As I went down-stairs I heard Bill singing,

"Irony and Pity. When you're feeling.. . Oh, Give them Irony and Give them Pity. Oh, give them Irony.When they're feeling. . . Just a little irony. Just a little pity.. ."

He kept on singing until he came down-stairs.

The tune was: "The Bells are Ringing for Me and my Gal."

> <font color=red>He kept on singing until he came down-stairs. The tune was: "The Bells are Ringing for Me and my Gal." </font>

> Bill哼的调的歌名应为"For me and my Gal"（gal即"girl, young woman"）. 它的第一句歌词就是"The bells are ringing for me and my gal". 这首歌1917年发行后非常流行，演唱者是George W. Meyer, 在当时是“锡盘巷”（Tin Pan Alley）流行乐的代表人物。

I was reading a week-old Spanish paper.

"What's all this irony and pity?"

"What? Don't you know about Irony and Pity?"

"No. Who got it up?"

"Everybody. They're mad about it in New York. It's just like the Fratellinisused to be."

The girl came in with the coffee and buttered toast. Or, rather, it was bread toasted and buttered.

"Ask her if she's got any jam," Bill said. "Be ironical with her."

"Have you got any jam?"

"That's not ironical. I wish I could talk Spanish."

The coffee was good and we drank it out of big bowls.

The girl brought in a glass dish of raspberry jam.

"Thank you." "Hey! that's not the way," Bill said.

"Say something ironical. Make some crack about Primo de Rivera."

> Primo de Rivera（1870-1930）是西班牙的一位将军，1923年通过发动军事政变上台成为独裁者（dictator）, 直到1930年因为经济管理失败引起人民普遍不满才被迫下台。小说中的这段对话进行时他才刚上台没几年。

> Riff（又作Rif）即“里夫山”，在摩洛哥北部沿海，在当地语言中，这个名字表示“海岸”（the coast）或是“大陆的边缘”（the edge of the land）. 这一片地方历来遭到西班牙的骚扰和侵袭，尤其是在20世纪20年代当中。虽然该地的原住民族——柏柏尔人部族（The Berbers）在首领阿布杜勒·克里姆的领导下奋起抗击西班牙的入侵，并且利用其险要的地形赢得了不少战役，但最后还是在1926年因为法国对西班牙的援助而最终被征服。

"Poor," said Bill. "Very poor. You can't do it. That's all.

You don't understand irony. You have no pity. Say something pitiful."

"Robert Cohn." "Not so bad. That's better. Now why is Cohn pitiful? Be ironic."

He took a big gulp of coffee.

"Aw, hell!" I said. "It's too early in the morning."

"There you go. And you claim you want to be a writer too.

You're only a newspaper man. An expatriated newspaper man.

You ought to be ironical the minute you get out of bed.

You ought to wake up with your mouth full of pity."

"Go on," I said. "Who did you get this stuff from?"

"Everybody. Don't you read? Don't you ever see anybody?

You know what you are? You're an expatriate.

Why don't you live in New York? Then you'd know these things.

What do you want me to do? Come over here and tell you every year?"

"Take some more coffee," I said.

"Good. Coffee is good for you.

It's the caffeine in it. Caffeine, we are here.

Caffeine puts a man on her horse and a woman in his grave.

You know what's the trouble with you? You're an expatriate.

One of the worst type. Haven't you heard that?

Nobody that ever left their own country ever wrote anything worth printing. Not even in the newspapers."

He drank the coffee.

"You're an expatriate. You've lost touch with the soil.

You get precious. Fake European standards have ruined you.

You drink yourself to death. You become obsessed by sex.

You spend all your time talking, not working.

You are an expatriate, see? You hang around cafés."

"It sounds like a swell life," I said. "When do I work?"

"You don't work. One group claims women support you. Another group claims you're impotent."

"No," I said. "I just had an accident."

"Never mention that," Bill said. "That's the sort of thing that can't be spoken of.

That's what you ought to work up into a mystery. Like Henry's bicycle."

He had been going splendidly, but he stopped.

I was afraid he thought he had hurt me with that crack about being impotent.

I wanted to start him again.

"It wasn't a bicycle," I said. "He was riding horseback."

"I heard it was a tricycle."

"Well," I said. "A plane is sort of likea tricycle. The joystick works the same way."

> ==joystick英 [ˈdʒɔɪstɪk] 美 [ˈdʒɔɪˌstɪk] n. 操纵杆==

"But you don't pedal it."

"No," I said, "I guess you don't pedal it."

"Let's lay off that," Bill said.

"All right. I was just standing up for the tricycle."

"I think he's a good writer, too," Bill said.

"And you're a hell of a good guy. Anybody ever tell you were a good guy?"

"I'm not a good guy."

"Listen. You're a hell of a good guy,and I'm fonder of you than anybody on earth.

I couldn't tell you that in New York. It'd mean I was a faggot.

That was what the Civil War was about. Abraham Lincoln was a faggot.

He was in love with General Grant. So was Jefferson Davis.

Lincoln just freed the slaves on a bet. The Dred Scott case was framed by the Anti-Saloon League.

Sex explains it all. The Colonel's Lady and Judy O'Grady are Lesbians under their skin."

He stopped."Want to hear some more?" "Shoot," I said.

"I don't know any more. Tell you some more at lunch."

"Old Bill," I said."You bum!"

### 背景知识

**💧****Fratellini Family**

**弗拉泰利尼家族**

"Everybody. They're mad about it in New York. It's just like the Fratellinis used to be."（“人人都在唱。整个纽约都着迷了。就像过去对弗拉泰利尼家族的那股劲头。”）

弗拉泰利尼家族（Fratellini Family）是欧洲马戏世家，以保尔（Paul）、弗朗索瓦（François）和阿尔贝特（Albert）三兄弟扮演的丑角而闻名。他们的才智、魅力和高超的演技受到广泛的赞誉，在第一次世界大战之后一度风靡巴黎，成为巴黎知识分子们的心头好（darlings of the Parisian intellectuals）.

弗朗索瓦善于扮演漂亮华丽的白脸小丑；阿尔贝特则擅长扮演不幸的，衣衫蓝缕的“奥古斯特”，他独创了一种设计得奇形怪状的新化妆：眉毛画地黑而且高，夸张的大嘴和鳞茎状的红鼻子（这种装扮几乎成为后来小丑化妆的典型风格）。

至于保尔则扮演公证人的角色，仅仅稍做化妆，其笑料则完全来自他在两兄弟之间的滑稽表演。值得一提的是，这个家族马戏团曾经在一战后的欧洲进行旅行表演，甚至去过当时刚刚成立的苏联。

继三兄弟之后，保尔之子维克多及维克多之女阿尼在法国成功继承了家族在丑角方面的表演传统，延续了这个丑角家族的艺术生命力。

### 课文理解

今天的情节主要围绕Jake和Bill在午饭前的一段玩笑和争辩展开。除了用典（对历史事件和人物的引用）非常多以外，这部分对话内容还有一个特点——主角们仿佛在谈论其他人和其他事情，但实际指向都是主角自己（在这里也就是Jake，我们稍后会分析）。因此在读者看来，就形成了一种很微妙并且有趣的巧合。



比如Bill一直就“俏皮/讽刺和怜悯”（Irony and Pity）抓着Jake不放，这里的诙谐之处在于，Jake本身就是“俏皮/讽刺和怜悯”的象征（化身）——



💧**Clue 1**: Jake himself is the token of Irony and Pity.



**Evidence 1**: "You don't work. One group claims women support you. Another group claims you're impotent."

“你不工作。有帮人坚持说是有些娘们在养你。另外有帮人说你是个不中用的男人。”



**Evidence 2**: Bill said. "And you're a hell of a good guy. Anybody ever tell you were a good guy?"

比尔说。“你呢，是个大好人。有人当面说过你是好人吗？”



首先，Jake的讽刺（或令人哭笑不得）之处在于，一方面他是一个不错的人，连Bill都赞不绝口，还打趣说道"I'm fonder of you than anybody on earth". 另一方面，Jake又是一个终日碌碌无为的人，并且还因为战争丧失了重要的生理机能，这种矛盾形成了一种很戏剧化的效果（Jake is a kind of superman who nevertheless can't perform the most basic of manly activities）. 由此他也深深引起了读者的怜悯和同情。

Jake和Bill在争论的另一个话题，其实同时和他们俩都相关。也就是所谓的“流亡者，移居者”（expatriate）. 



💧**Clue 2**: Jake becomes an expatriate and wastes his life away.



**Evidence 1**: "You know what's the trouble with you? You're an expatriate. One of the worst type. Haven't you heard that? Nobody that ever left their own country ever wrote anything worth printing. Not even in the newspapers."

“你知道你的问题在哪儿？你是一名流亡者。是最不幸的典型中的一份子。你没有听说过？一个人只要离开了自己的祖国，就写不出任何值得出版的作品。哪怕是报上的一篇新闻报道。”



**Evidence 2**: "You're an expatriate. You've lost touch with the soil. You get precious. Fake European standards have ruined you. You drink yourself to death. You become obsessed by sex. You spend all your time talking, not working. You are an expatriate, see? You hang around cafés."

“你是一名流亡者。你已经和土地失去了联系。你变得矫揉造作。冒牌的欧洲道德观念把你毁了。你嗜酒如命。你头脑里摆脱不了性的问题。你不务实事，整天消磨在高谈阔论之中。你是一名流亡者，明白吗？你在各家咖啡馆来回转悠。”

这里的"You've lost touch with the soil"是一句双关，不仅指在地理上Jake离开了祖国来到巴黎，也暗指他不能脚踏实地地生活，而只是在无止尽地挥霍时间、通过酒精和玩乐来抵抗对人生的幻灭感。

这一段的写作灵感可能就来自于格特鲁德·斯坦（Gertrude Stein，美国作家，当时活跃在巴黎的文化圈）对海明威说过的一番话："That is what you are. That's what you all are ... all of you young people who served in the war. You are a lost generation." 

其实这也是海明威对于自我以及同代人的困惑和探索：他们是否能在巴黎，或者现在又短暂地逃到了西班牙，找到可以依托的人生信条，来消除这种绝望和幻灭感？

**💧****吐司的由来以及有趣的俚语**

The girl came in with the coffee and buttered toast. Or, rather, it was bread toasted and buttered.（女孩端着咖啡和涂黄油的吐司进来。或者不如说是普通的面包片烤过后涂上了黄油。）

为什么Jake在这里要强调这是烤过后的普通面包片（bread toasted）而不是吐司（toast）呢？其实吐司一般分为两种，一种是法式吐司，另一种就是普通的吐司。



\1. 普通吐司和法式吐司的区别

普通的吐司其实就是“烤面包片”（这也是toast这个词的本义）。toast 从拉丁文的torrere (to burn) 而来，准确的含义就是“切成片的面包经过浅表烧糊”（sliced bread singed by heat）. 

而法式吐司（French toast）则是用鸡蛋和牛奶把面包片裹起来再进行轻炸或油煎而制成（a dish made of bread soaked in eggs and milk, then fried）, 因此法式吐司也叫eggy bread. 以及我们平时看到的“西多士”（粤语里对Western toast的音译）也是这种吐司哦~ 

对于Jake来说，他因为长期生活在巴黎，所以自然会觉得吐司就应该是法式吐司那样的，而普通的烤面包则称不上是吐司。



\2. 吐司的由来

关于吐司的由来有很多传说，其中一个是说从埃及而来——基于面包其实是古埃及人发明的，因为他们发现如果把面团放一会儿（相当于“醒面”），它就会膨胀起来（空气中的酵母菌孢子计进入面团里），接着再烤一下，就可以维持这个形状了。

学会做面包后的埃及人又发现了一个问题，也就是长时间把面包放在沙漠的高温环境下，面包会变得很硬，吃起来很不方便（When left out in the desert heat for long periods of time, the bread would go hard and became difficult to eat）, 但如果是把面包切成片再烤一下，就既能便于储藏又能维持美味的口感了（By scorching slices of bread, they lasted longer as a palatable food）.



\3. 和吐司相关的有趣俚语

①**sb is toast**

这个表达的意思就是“某人已经完蛋了、成为过去时了”（a state of being "outcast", "finished", "burned, scorched, wiped out, [or] demolished"）, 这个表达和说"sb is history"的意思是一样的。

②**warm as toast**

这是一个比喻的说法，表示“非常暖和舒适”（very warm and cozy），比如：

The baby will be warm as toast in that blanket.

这个婴儿睡在毯子里话会很暖和。

 We were as warm as toast by the side of the fire.

我们待在炉火边可舒服了。

**③ to toast sb's health**

toast 有“敬酒”的这一层含义，原因是最早的传统有把热面包加到酒里形成一种独特的风味（warmed bread was placed in a drink），后来这种酒也被认为是“尊敬”的象征，所以to toast sb's health就有了“敬祝某人健康”的意思。

to propose a toast 也是一样的含义哦~比如：

Before we all sit down to our meal, I just want to propose a toast to my mother.

在我们所有人落座吃饭之前，我想先向我的母亲敬一杯酒。

关于toast还有一个有趣的现象叫作"the buttered toast phenomenon", 感兴趣的话也可以去查一查它是指什么哦~

We packed the lunch and two bottles of wine in the rucksack, and Bill put it on.

I carried the rod-case and the landing-nets slung over my back.

We started up the road and then went across a meadow and found a path that crossed the fields and went toward the woods on the slope of the first hill.

We walked across the fields on the sandy path.

The fields were rolling and grassy and the grass was short from the sheep grazing.

The cattle were up in the hills. We heard their bells in the woods.

The path crossed a stream on a foot-log.

The log was surfaced off, and there was a sapling bent across for a rail.

We went up a steep bank and across the rolling fields.

Looking back we saw Burguete, white houses and red roofs, and the white road with a truck going along it and the dust rising.

Beyond the fields we crossed another faster-flowing stream.

A sandy road led down to the ford and beyond into the woods.

The path crossed the stream on another foot-log below the ford, and joined the road, and we went into the woods.

It was a beech wood and the trees were very old.

Their roots bulked above the ground and the branches were twisted.

> ==bulk==

We walked on the road between the thick trunks of the old beeches and the sunlight came through the leaves in light patches on the grass.

The trees were big, and the foliage was thick but it was not gloomy.

There was no undergrowth, only the smooth grass, very green and fresh,and the big gray trees well spaced as though it were a park.

> ==undergrowth英 [ˈʌndəgrəʊθ] 美 [ˈʌndərgroʊθ] n. 矮树丛，灌木丛==

"This is country," Bill said.

The road went up a hill and we got into thick woods, and the road kept on climbing.

Sometimes it dipped down but rose again steeply.

All the time we heard the cattle in the woods.

Finally, the road came out on the top of the hills.

We were on the top of the height of land that was the highest part of the range of wooded hills we had seen from Burguete.

There were wild strawberries growing on the sunny side of the ridge in a little clearing in the trees.

Ahead the road came out of the forest and went along the shoulder of the ridge of hills.

The hills ahead were not wooded, and there were great fields of yellowgorse.

Way off we saw the steep bluffs, dark with trees and jutting with gray stone, that marked the course of the Irati River (伊拉蒂河).

"We have to follow this road along the ridge, cross these hills, go through the woods on the far hills, and come down to the Irati valley," I pointed out to Bill.

"That's a hell of a hike."

"It's too far to go and fish and comeback the same day, comfortably."

"Comfortably. That's a nice word. We'll have to go like hell to get there and back and have any fishing at all."

It was a long walk and the country was very fine, but we were tired when we came down the steep road that led out of the wooded hills into the valley of the Rio de la Fabrica (法布里卡河谷).

The road came out from the shadow of the woods into the hot sun.

Ahead was a river-valley. Beyond the river was a steep hill.

There was a field of buckwheat on the hill.

We saw a white house under some trees on the hillside.

It was very hot and we stopped under some trees beside a dam thatcrossed the river.

Bill put the pack against one of the trees and we jointed up the rods, put on the reels, tied on leaders, and got ready to fish.

> ②tie on leaders “绑上引线”，tie on表示“绑上，系上”，比如tie on a ribbon（系上丝带）；leader是指钓竿上把主线和鱼钩连在一起的引线（a short length of fishing line between the main line and the hook）.

"You're sure this thing has trout in it?" Bill asked.

"It's full of them." "I'm going to fish afly (飞蝇钓法). You got any McGintys (一款假蝇钩)?"

"There's some in there." "You going to fish bait?"

"Yeah. I'm going to fish the dam here."

"Well, I'll take the fly-book, then." He tied on a fly.

"Where'd I better go? Up or down?"

"Down is the best. They're plenty up above, too."

Bill went down the bank."Take a worm can."

"No, I don't want one. If they won't take a fly I'll just flick it around."

Bill was down below watching the stream.

"Say," he called up against the noise of the dam.

"How about putting the wine in that spring up the road?"

"All right," I shouted. Bill waved his hand and started down the stream.

I found the two wine-bottles in the pack, and carried them up the road to where the water of a spring flowed out of an iron pipe.

There was a board over the spring and I lifted it and, knocking the corks firmly into the bottles, lowered them down into the water.

It was so cold my hand and wrist felt numbed.

I put back the slab of wood, and hoped nobody would find the wine.

I got my rod that was leaning against the tree, took the bait-can and landing-net, and walked out onto the dam.

It was built to provide a head of water for driving logs.

> ②tumble into “（水）奔流形成”，tumble本身有“跌倒、滚落”的意思，这里指水“”快速流动（to flow quickly）, 比如：A narrow stream tumbled over the rocks.（一条狭窄的小溪在岩石间奔流。）

In the white water at the foot of the dam it was deep.

As I baited up, a trout shot up out of the white water into the falls and was carried down.

Before I could finish baiting, another trout jumped at the falls, making the same lovely arc and disappearing into the water that was thundering down.

I put on a good-sized sinker and dropped into the white water close to the edge of the timbers of the dam.

I did not feel the first trout strike.

When I started to pull up I felt that I had one and brought him, fighting and bending the rod almost double, out of the boiling water at the foot of the falls, and swung him up and onto the dam.

He was a good trout, and I banged his head against the timber so that he quivered out straight, and then slipped him into my bag.

While I had him on, several trout had jumped at the falls.

As soon as I baited up and droppedin again I hooked another and brought him in the same way.

In a little while I had six. They were all about the same size.

I laid them out, side by side, all their heads pointing the same way, and looked at them.

They were beautifully colored and firm and hard from the cold water.

It was a hot day, so I slit them all and shucked out the insides, gills and all, and tossed them over across the river.

> ==shuck英 [ʃʌk] 美 [ʃʌk] vt. 剥壳，剥外皮，脱去 n. 壳，外皮，荚；毫无价值的东西==

I took the trout ashore, washed them in the cold, smoothly heavy water above the dam, and then picked some ferns and packed themall in the bag, three trout on a layer of ferns, then another layer of ferns,then three more trout, and then covered them with ferns.

They looked nice in the ferns, and now the bag was bulky, and I put it in the shade of the tree.

It was very hot on the dam, so I putmy worm-can in the shade with the bag, and got a book out of the packand settled down under the tree to read until Bill should come up for lunch.

### 背景知识

**💧Fly fishing 飞蝇钓法**

"I'm going to fish a fly. You got any McGintys?"（“我要用假蝇钩钓。你有没有麦金蒂蝇钩？”）

fish a fly可不是指“钓飞蝇”哦~ McGintys指的也是一款经典的假蝇钓钩，而后面提到的fly-book则是装蝇钩的盒子，通常形状像一本书而得名（"Well, I'll take the fly-book, then." He tied on a fly.）

这里的方法和工具其实都属于钓鱼当中的一种技法——飞蝇钓法（Fish flying）. 它是用仿生饵模仿飞蝇、蚊虫、蜻蜓等有翅昆虫落水，从而刺激水体中凶猛掠食性鱼类（比如Jake和Bill要钓的鳟鱼——“trout”就属于这类，其他还包括三文鱼“salmon”等）。

假蝇钩（artificial flies）一般通过将禽或兽的毛发、羽毛或者其他材料，包括自然的和合成的（natural and synthetic）绑在鱼钩上制成。并且这些蝇钩还会依据各地水生昆虫或饵鱼的种类不同而在大小、色彩以及形态上作出变化（flies are tied in sizes, colors and patterns to match local terrestrial and aquatic insects, baitfish）.

采用飞蝇钓的季节一般是每年春夏之交（3~4月），这时候有翅类的浮游动物正好羽化成虫，而掠食性鱼类的捕食习惯则是凭直觉捕食以及食物入口再辨别吞咽，所以这种高超的“障眼法”才得以发挥作用。在一天当中，最佳的时期则是清晨和黄昏，此时掠食性鱼类多在近岸的水体上层成群游弋，捕食漂浮的落水昆虫和在水面产卵的蚊子。

另一个要注意的是，飞蝇钓需要保持钓点安静，掠食性鱼类胆小怕人，对声音反应极为敏感，转换钓点时脚步要轻，并尽量利用地形地物隐蔽自己，更不要穿着颜色鲜艳的服装。此外，甩竿的幅度还不能太大，尽量不要使钓竿的影子在钓点上掠过以免惊扰鱼群。

这种钓法灵活自由，抛用控线等对钓鱼者的要求很高；而且它所用的配备通常别的钓具也无法代替，报价不菲，被称为钓中贵族或钓中高尔夫。

### 课文理解

我们曾经简略地介绍过，海明威本人对自然的热爱以及受自然影响之深从童年时期就已经开始了，他会缠着父亲带自己到森林里露营以及打猎钓鱼等，所以他的作品几乎也都没有逃过人与自然这个主题的，比如他的短篇《大双心河》（我们在第三本书中会读到哦~）以及在更为成熟的中篇《老人与海》里也可以算是把这个主题提炼到哲学思考的层次了。



今天的内容则是Jake和Bill经过长途跋涉后来到法布里卡河谷钓鱼（the valley of the Rio de la Fabrica）. 作者对沿途的自然环境以及Jake钓鱼的全程都进行了细致的描绘。在海明威看来，自然既是狩猎钓鱼的场所，也是一个身心休憩疗愈的地方。比如Jake和Bill钓鱼中的各自较劲也被衬托在非常和谐愉悦的氛围中——



💧**Clue 1**: The competition between Jake and Bill is a pleasant one.



**Evidence 1**: "You going to fish bait?"

"Yeah. I'm going to fish the dam here."

"Well, I'll take the fly-book, then." He tied on a fly. "Where'd I better go? Up or down?"

"Down is the best. They're plenty up above, too."

Bill went down the bank.

“你要用鱼饵来钓吗？”

“对，我就在水坝这钓。”

“那我就把蝇钩盒拿走了。”他系上一只蝇钩。“我到哪儿去好？去上边还是下边？”

“下边最好。不过上边的鱼也很多。”

比尔顺着河边向下边走去。



Jake和Bill并没有公开宣称要一较高下，但从两人分别选择了不同的垂钓地点以及方式就已经透露出“较量”的意味了。并且这种竞争在静谧宜人的环境烘托下，丝毫没有争锋的紧张感，而是愉悦并且友好的（pleasant and amicable）.



另一个值得留意的细节是Jake和自然独处时的自得和充实——



💧**Clue 2**: Jake is content with being alone.



**Evidence 1**: Before I could finish baiting, another trout jumped at the falls, making the same lovely arc and disappearing into the water that was thundering down.

我还没有来得及挂好鱼饵，又有一条鳟鱼向瀑布蹿去，在空中画出一条同样美丽的弧线，消失在轰隆隆地奔泻而下的水流中。



**Evidence 2**: It was very hot on the dam, so I put my worm-can in the shade with the bag, and got a book out of the pack and settled down under the tree to read until Bill should come up for lunch.

坝上非常热，所以我把装蚯蚓的铁罐同猎物袋一起放在背阴的地方，从背包里拿出一本书，安坐在树下看起来，等比尔上来吃中饭。



在钓鱼的过程中，Jake也没有停止欣赏一切和自然有关的美妙之处，比如鳟鱼跃起时的弧线（the same lovely arc）. 在把战利品细心地放置好后（用蕨类植物铺了三层，中间分别放上三条鳟鱼），Jake还颇有兴致地拿起书来读，尽管天气很炎热也没有一点焦躁和厌烦。Jake在这里的表现和我们在前面的内容里看到的有很大的不同（似乎更为自得并且乐于享受生活的平淡），这也是海明威想展现的自然的“治愈”作用（the therapeutic value of nature）.

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****除了徒步，还有哪些新鲜有趣的户外运动？**

当Jake指给Bill看他们要如何翻山越岭才能到伊拉蒂河谷的时候（"We have to follow this road along the ridge, cross these hills, go through the woods on the far hills, and come down to the Irati valley," I pointed out to Bill.）Bill感觉非常绝望，因为这一段徒步实在非常累人（"That's a hell of a hike."）

hike 在这里指“〔在山区或乡间的〕的徒步旅行，远足”。随着时代的发展，“徒步”（hiking）已经开始成为一种流行的户外运动，它和散步以及竞走都不同，而是有目的地地在郊区、农村或者山野间进行中长距离的走路锻炼。

除了徒步，还有不少既有趣又有挑战性的户外运动，比如以下↓



\1. Hash House Harriers (HHH or H3) 猎狗追兔子

Hash 作为一种跑步健身的游戏正在悄然兴起。它起源于1938年马来西亚的吉隆坡，全称是“Hash House Harriers”（翻译成中文就是猎狗追兔子）。在Hash中最重要的一件事就是跑步，而且是有趣味、有难度的跑步。

规则是这样的：由一人扮演“兔子”（the hare），事先在野外设置好错综复杂的路线，而一群自称为“猎狗”（harriers）的参加者则追踪而至，边跑边大喊口令，全然不顾旁人惊讶的眼神，顶着烈日骄阳或淋着瓢泼大雨，寻找兔子留下的蛛丝马迹，直至逮住兔子为止。

Hash的另一个主题则是“啤酒”，当“猎狗”们到达终点时，还可以尽情畅饮啤酒（其中最受欢迎的是“姜汁啤酒，Ginger beer”）. 



\2. Kayak and canoe 皮划艇

皮划艇作为奥运比赛的项目之一为大家所熟知：在1924年，它作为表演项目进入奥运会，1936年，皮划艇成为奥运会正式比赛项目。它具体又分为皮艇（kayak）和划艇（canoe）.

两种各有不同的历史：皮艇起源于格陵兰岛上的爱斯基摩人所制作的一种小船，这种船用鲸鱼皮、水獭皮包在骨头架子上，用两端有桨叶的桨划动。

划艇则起源于加拿大，因此又称加拿大划艇。但实际上这两种艇都是从独木舟演变而来的。

皮划艇在国外其实相当普及，其原因包括经济投入和技术门槛都相对低、功能多适应性强，既可以做竞技使用，也适合家庭休闲。

一般在静水（flatwater）中进行的适合休闲、水面长途旅行、游戏娱乐、竞技竞速等；而如果是在急流（whitewater）中则主要是漂流。当然也有人用皮划艇在海上冲浪，但这个对个人的技术要求比较高。



\3. Treetop adventures 树上探险

树上探险活动起源于欧洲，渐渐成为一种引领户外休闲的领袖活动。它通过在树上设置不同的关卡，关卡的难易程度不同，风格各异，刺激强度不等使人们在参与树上探险的时候形成不同的心灵体验。同时又能拥抱绿色、回归自然。

树上探险活动虽然在某些项目上也需要参与者的体力支持，但是它绝非一种简单的体能测试，迥异于普通的拓展训练等。它是一种激发参与者挑战自我雄心、提高自信心并且享受在心灵深处认识自己的娱乐休闲活动。

这种运动从低至10岁的未成年人，高至65岁的高龄族都可参与。这就是树上探险。只要身高在1.4米以上，体重在130公斤以下，身体健康的人都可以到树上去一显身手。

It was a little past noon and there was not much shade, but I sat against the trunk of two of the trees that grew together, and read.

The book was something by A. E. W. Mason, and I was reading a wonderful story about a man who had been frozen in the Alps and then fallen into a glacier and disappeared,

and his bride was going to wait twenty-four years exactly for his body to come out on the moraine, while her true love waited too, and they were still waiting when Bill came up.

"Get any?" he asked.

He had his rod and his bag and his net all in one hand, and he was sweating. I hadn't heard him come up, because of the noise from the dam.

"Six. What did you get?"

Bill sat down, opened up his bag, laid a big trout on the grass.

He took out three more, each one a little bigger than the last, and laid them side by side in the shade from the tree.

His face was sweaty and happy.

"How are yours?" "Smaller."

"Let's see them." "They're packed."

"How big are they really?"

"They're all about the size of your smallest."

"You're not holding out on me?" "I wish I were."

> <font color=red>"You're not holding out on me?"</font>
>
> “你不是瞒着我吧？”
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> hold out on sb 表示“向某人隐瞒（事情，金钱）”（to keep something from sb, especially information or money）. 比如：She must have been holding out on him all these years.（这些年来她肯定一直瞒着他。）

"Get them all on worms?" "Yes." "You lazy bum!"

Bill put the trout in the bag and started for the river, swinging the open bag.

He was wet from the waist down and I knew he must have been wading the stream.

I walked up the road and got out the two bottles of wine.

They were cold. Moisture beaded on the bottles as I walked back to the trees.

> ==moisture==
>
> n. 水分；湿气（small amounts of water that are present in the air, in a substance, or on a surface）
>
> 原文：Moisture beaded on the bottles as I walked back to the trees.

>
> 💧moisture 在这里指“水汽”，它的形容词形式是moist，表示“潮湿的”（damp, wet）, 比如：Her eyes were moist (= she was almost crying) .
>
> 她的眼睛湿润了。

I spread the lunch on a newspaper, and uncorked one of the bottles and leaned the other against a tree.

Bill came up drying his hands, his bag plump with ferns.

"Let's see that bottle," he said. He pulled the cork, and tipped up the bottle and drank.

"Whew! That makes my eyes ache.""Let's try it."

The wine was icy cold and tasted faintly rusty.

"That's not such filthy wine," Bill said.

> ==filthy==
>
> adj. 下流的；肮脏的（disgustingly dirty; obscene or offensive）
>
> 糟糕的（nasty）
>
> 原文："That's not such filthy wine," Bill said.
>
> “这酒不那么难喝，”比尔说
>
> 💧filth 作为名词本身指“污秽之物”（a disgusting amount of dirt）, 还可以表示“下流话”（very offensive language）. 
>
> 💧filthy 除了可以表示和以上两个义项有关的含义，还可以指“令人不悦的”（extremely unpleasant），比如糟糕的天气就可以说filthy weather. 

"The cold helps it," I said.

We unwrapped the little parcels of lunch."Chicken."

"There's hard-boiled eggs." "Find any salt?"

"First the egg," said Bill. "Then the chicken. Even Bryan could see that."

"He's dead. I read it in the paper yesterday."

"No. Not really?" "Yes. Bryan's dead."

Bill laid down the egg he was peeling.

"Gentlemen," he said, and unwrapped a drumstick from a piece of newspaper.

> ==drumstick英 [ˈdrʌmstɪk] 美 [ˈdrʌmˌstɪk] n. 鼓槌，鼓槌（形物）体（如鸡腿等）==

"I reverse the order. For Bryan's sake. As a tribute to the Great Commoner. First the chicken; then the egg."

"Wonder what day God created the chicken?"

"Oh," said Bill, sucking the drumstick, "how should we know? We should not question.

Our stay on earth is not for long. Let us rejoice and believe and give thanks."

"Eat an egg."Bill gestured with the drumstick in one hand and the bottle of wine in the other.

"Let us rejoice in our blessings. Let us utilize the fowls of the air.

Let us utilize the product of the vine. Will you utilize a little, brother?"

> ==utilize英 [ˈju:təlaɪz] 美 [ˈjutlˌaɪz] vt. 利用，使用==

>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> rejoice in our blessings, the fowls of the air（飞禽）, the product of the vine（葡萄酒） 其实都是对《圣经》里的句子的化用哦~ 所以这里Bill依然是带着调侃的语气（见背景知识的分析）。

"After you, brother."Bill took a long drink.

"Utilize a little, brother," he handed me the bottle.

"Let us not doubt, brother. Let us not pry into the holy mysteries of the hencoop with simian fingers.

> <font color=red>Let us not pry into the holy mysteries of the hencoop with simian fingers.</font>

>
> ①pry into 表示“（冒昧）打探”（to try to find out details in an impolite way），比如：We do not want people prying into our affairs.（我们不想让人刺探我们的私事。）
>
> ②hencoop 指“家禽笼”（a cage for poultry）, hen表示“母鸡”，所以这里翻译为“母鸡窝”也是可以的，而且这一句话还和上文紧密相连：所谓的“母鸡窝里神圣的奥秘”（the holy mysteries of the hencoop）也就是“到底是先有鸡还是先有蛋”这个问题；
>
> ③with simian fingers “用猿猴的爪子”，simian表示“猿猴的，类人猿的”，其实就在暗指人类human（按照达尔文的进化论，人是从猿猴进化而来的）；并且这里是一个比喻，并不是真的要把爪子伸进鸡窝里，而是指不要用进化论这一套来挑战《圣经》的权威。

Let us accept on faith and simply say — I want you to join with me in saying — What shall we say, brother?"

He pointed the drumstick at me and went on.

"Let me tell you. We will say, and I for one am proud to say—and I want you to say with me, on your knees, brother.

> <font color=red>We will say, and I for one am proud to say——and I want you to say with me, on your knees, brother.</font>
>
> 我们要说，而且就我个人来说，要自豪地说——我要你跪下和我一起说，兄弟。

> on one's knees 也就是“跪着”的意思，一般是指“乞求”（in a way that shows you have no power but want or need something very much）或“祷告”（to pray on one's knees）, 比如：He went on his knees begging for his job back.（他跪下来乞求恢复原来的工作。）

Let no man be ashamed to kneel here in the great out-of-doors.

Remember the woods were God's first temples.

> <font color=red>Remember the woods were God's first temples.</font>

> 记住，丛林是上帝最早的圣殿。
>
> **💧知识拓展**
>
> God's first temple 即“第一圣殿”又叫“所罗门神殿”（Solomon's temple），于公元前957年，在耶路撒冷的莫里亚山（on Mount Moriah in Jerusalem）建成。它在公元前587年新巴比伦国王尼布甲尼撒灭亡犹太王国时被彻底摧毁。后代的犹太人，把遍地的乱石重新拾起，在原地砌成了一堵墙，并在此地重建了“第二圣殿”。
>
> 根据《圣经》记载，建殿用的主要木料是香柏木、松木和檀香木等珍贵木材。所以这里才说the woods were God's first temples, 同时woods也是双关，既表示“木材”，也指Jake和Bill所处的这片“森林”。

Let us kneel and say: 'Don't eat that, Lady — that's Mencken.'

"Here," I said. "Utilize a little of this."

We uncorked the other bottle.

"What's the matter?" I said. "Didn't you like Bryan?"

"I loved Bryan," said Bill. "We were like brothers."

"Where did you know him?"

"He and Mencken and I all went to Holy Cross together."

"And Frankie Fritsch." "It's a lie. Frankie Fritsch went to Fordham."

"Well," I said, "I went to Loyola with Bishop Manning."

"It's a lie," Bill said. "I went to Loyola with Bishop Manning myself."

"You're cock-eyed," I said."On wine?" "Why not?"

"It's the humidity," Bill said. "They ought to take this damn humidity away."

> ==humidity英 [hju:ˈmɪdəti] 美 [hjuˈmɪdɪti] n. （空气中的）湿度；潮湿==

"Have another shot." "Is this all we've got?" "Only the two bottles."

"Do you know what you are?" Bill looked at the bottle affectionately.

> ==affectionately英 [ə'fekʃənətlɪ] 美 [ə'fekʃənətlɪ] adv. 脉脉；挚爱地，亲切地==

"No," I said."You're in the pay of theAnti-Saloon League."

"I went to Notre Dame with Wayne B. Wheeler."

"It's a lie," said Bill. "I went to Austin Business College with Wayne B. Wheeler. He was class president."

"Well," I said, "the saloon must go."

> ==saloon英 [səˈlu:n] 美 [səˈlun] n. 大厅；酒吧，酒馆==

"You're right there, old classmate," Bill said.

"The saloon must go, and I will take it with me."

"You're cock-eyed." "On wine?" "On wine."

"Well, maybe I am." "Want to take a nap?" "All right."

We lay with our heads in the shade and looked up into the trees.

"You asleep?" "No," Bill said. "I was thinking."

I shut my eyes. It felt good lying on the ground.

"Say," Bill said, "what about this Brett business?"

"What about it?" "Were you ever in love with her?" "Sure."

"For how long?"<br>"Off and on for a hell of a long time."

> <font color=red>"Off and on for a hell of a long time."</font>
>
> “断断续续地拖了好长时间。”
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> off and on 表示“断断续续地，间歇性地”，相当于intermittently. 再比如on and on就表示“一直持续地”（without stopping, continuously）.

"Oh, hell!" Bill said. "I'm sorry, fella."

"It's all right," I said. "I don't give a damn any more."

"Really?" "Really. Only I'd a hell of a lot rather not talk about it."

"You aren't sore I asked you?" "Why the hell should I be?"

"I'm going to sleep," Bill said. He put a newspaper over his face.

"Listen, Jake," he said, "are you really a Catholic?" "Technically."

"What does that mean?" "I don't know."

"All right, I'll go to sleep now," he said. "Don't keep me awake by talking so much."

I went to sleep, too. When I woke up Bill was packing the rucksack.

Jt was late in the afternoon and the shadow from the trees was long and went out over the dam.

I was stiff from sleeping on the ground.

"What did you do? Wake up?" Bill asked.

"Why didn't you spend the night?" I stretched and rubbed my eyes.

"I had a lovely dream," Bill said.

"I don't remember what it was about, but it was a lovely dream."

"I don't think I dreamt." "You ought to dream," Bill said.

"All our biggest business men have been dreamers.

Look at Ford. Look at President Coolidge. Look at Rockefeller. Look at Jo Davidson."

I disjointed my rod and Bill's and packed them in the rod-case.

I put the reels in the tackle-bag. Bill had packed the rucksack and we put one of the trout-bags in.

I carried the other."Well," said Bill, "have we got everything?"

"The worms." "Your worms. Put them in there."

He had the pack on his back and I put the worm-cans in one of the outside flap pockets.

"You got everything now?"

I looked around on the grass at the foot of the elm-trees.

"Yes."We started up the road into the woods.

It was a long walk home to Burguete, and it was dark when we came down across the fields to the road, and along the road between the houses of the town, their windows lighted, to the inn.

We stayed five days at Burguete and had good fishing.

The nights were cold and the days were hot, and there was always a breeze even in the heat of the day.

It was hot enough so that it felt good to wade in a cold stream, and the sun dried you when you came out and sat on the bank.

We found a stream with a pool deep enough to swim in.

In the evenings we played three-handed bridge with an Englishman named Harris, who had walked over from Saint Jean Pied de Port and was stopping at the inn for the fishing.

He was very pleasant and went with us twice to the Irati River.

There was no word from Robert Cohn nor from Brett and Mike.

### 背景知识

**💧Bill讽刺的Bryan是何许人？**

Jake和Bill在吃午餐的时候提到了一个刚刚过世名为Bryan的人物："First the egg," said Bill. "Then the chicken. Even Bryan could see that." "He's dead. I read it in the paper yesterday."（“先来个鸡蛋，”比尔说。“然后吃鸡。这个道理连布莱恩都明白。”）

并且还拿他调侃了一番："I reverse the order. For Bryan's sake. As a tribute to the Great Commoner. First the chicken; then the egg."（“我来颠倒一下。为了布莱恩。为了向这位伟大的‘平民’表示敬意。先吃鸡，然后吃鸡蛋。”）

如果对这位人物以及他的事迹没有了解，这一段会看得云里雾里（大量引用穿插写作时的真实社会背景也是海明威的风格之一，增添故事真实性的同时也让角色刻画更加饱满）。

首先来看一下这个人的身份背景：威廉·詹宁斯·布赖恩（William Jennings Bryan）（1860年3月19日 - 1925年7月26日）是美国民主党（Democratic Party）和平民党（Populist Party）的领袖，也是一位颇有吸引力的演说家（orator）, 但他1896年、1900年、1908年三次竞选总统均未成功。

由于生长在伊利诺伊州（Illinois）, 也就是美国的中西部，布莱恩在一生当中最重要的政治立场之一就是支持农民的利益，而反对东部城市的利益。比如他所在的平民党就是以保护平民，尤其是农民利益为诉求的。因此他也被称为“The Great Commoner”（commoner即“平民”，和nobleman“贵族”相对）。

19世纪末平民党运动兴起）

Bill在这里对布莱恩的调侃和布莱恩一生中的最后一个“公案”有关：布莱恩因为坚决主张对《圣经》作实事求是的解释，于是前往田纳西州的代顿城协助审理对一位教师的控诉案。这位生物教师被指控讲授达尔文主义成人的进化起源（teaching evolution in public school），而不讲上帝造人。最后被告败诉，这位生物老师被裁决有罪并罚款（后被驳回）。当年7月26日（1925年），在该案结束后没几天，布莱恩就因为在这场法庭战斗中耗费过多精力以及情绪过于激动，于是在睡梦中病逝。

那么Bill为什么又说为了布莱恩他们要先吃鸡再吃蛋呢？这里牵扯到了“先有鸡还是先有蛋”这个问题——如果要用《圣经》来解释，那么肯定是先有鸡，因为上帝先创造的是鸡而不是鸡蛋（“神说，水要多多滋生有生命的物，要有雀鸟飞在地面以上，天空之中。”《创世纪》第一章）。

虽然圣经原文没有明确提及“鸡”这种生物，但用到了bird这个词，bird其实就包含了鸟类和禽类。如果要布莱恩回答这个问题，他肯定回看一本正经地指着圣经上的字告诉别人是先有鸡。

虽然先吃鸡还是先吃蛋跟先有鸡还是先有蛋这个问题一点关系都没有，但Bill为了讽刺布莱恩对待《圣经》过于咬文嚼字和追求事实（最后还把自己给累死了……），所以提出向他“致敬”，先吃鸡再吃蛋。

### 课文理解

今天的内容里，Jake和Bill午饭后的对话中发生了一个小插曲，也就是Bill突然问到Jake和Brett的关系，这代表了Jake和Bill俩人关系亲密度的提升（an increase of intimacy）, 而Jake也首次亲口承认了自己和Brett的情史。但还有一点是他始终没有坦承的—— 

💧**Clue 1**: Jake is not fully open with Bill.



**Evidence 1**: "Say," Bill said, "what about this Brett business?"

"What about it?"

"Were you ever in love with her?"

"Sure."

“喂，”比尔说，“你跟勃莱特是怎么回事？”

“什么怎么回事？”

“你曾经爱过她吧？”

“是啊。”

比尔顺着河边向下边走去。



**Evidence 2**: "It's all right," I said. "I don't give a damn any more."

"Really?"

"Really. Only I'd a hell of a lot rather not talk about it."

"You aren't sore I asked you?"

"Why the hell should I be?"

“没什么，”我说。“我已经不在乎了。”

“真的？”

“真的，不过我很不愿意谈起这件事。”

“我问你这件事，你不生气？”

“我干嘛要生气？”



Jake并没有向Bill坦承自己对Brett依然余情未了，这可能是出于他想回避关于自己受伤这件事（Bill势必会追问他和Brett分手的原因，以及他的痛苦来源）。但是这个话题并不会到此就戛然而止，在之后的情节里还会继续。

Jake和Bill在布尔戈特（Burguete）待了整整五天的时间（We stayed five days at Burguete and had good fishing）, 这期间他们过着非常简单而朴素的生活（和在巴黎的声色犬马完全不同）。我们来看一下作者在结尾的描述——



💧**Clue 2**: Jake and Bill enjoy the tranquility（宁静） in the country.



**Evidence 1**: The nights were cold and the days were hot, and there was always a breeze even in the heat of the day. It was hot enough so that it felt good to wade in a cold stream, and the sun dried you when you came out and sat on the bank.

夜晚冷，白天热，但即使在白天最热的时候也有微风。天这么热，在很凉的河里蹚水非常舒服。当你上岸坐着的工夫，太阳就把你的衣衫晒干了。



**Evidence 2**: In the evenings we played three-handed bridge with an Englishman named Harris, who had walked over from Saint Jean Pied de Port and was stopping at the inn for the fishing. 

网上我们同一位姓哈里斯的英国人打三人桥牌，他是从圣让皮德波（法国小城，位于比利牛斯山脉北麓）徒步过来的，歇在这家旅店，要去钓鱼。



俩人的生活基本除了钓鱼就是以打桥牌为娱，但读起来却不感觉任何重复和枯燥，足见作者的笔力深厚。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧English Idioms from Bible**

**来自《圣经》的英语习语（上）**

《圣经》对英语语言的影响有多深呢？不恰当地说，它的地位甚至在《牛津英语词典》（Oxford English Dictionary）（最全面且权威的英语词典）以及莎士比亚（把外来词和中世纪英语完美结合并推动了英语的现代化，以及贡献无数的成语表达）的作品之上。

《圣经》对英语习语的影响主要有两方面：首先是其中的人物和故事被赋予象征和比喻的含义；其次则是其中的短语和句子在传颂中被吸收进日常语言中。如果要掌握地道的英文表达，学习《圣经》几乎就是必不可少的。今天我们先来看第一种，也就是由人物和故事延伸而来的习语~



\1. the old Adam

本性之恶

亚当的故事相信是大家最熟悉的了，在《圣经·旧约》的开篇“创世纪”（Genesis）里记载了源上帝在创造天地宇宙后，用泥土做出第一个男人，取名亚当；又用男人的肋骨做出第一个女人，取名夏娃。二人生活在伊甸园。夏娃受蛇的引诱，违背神命偷吃了伊甸园内智慧树上的禁果，又把禁果给亚当吃。从此人的眼睛明亮，能看见双方的身体，并能分辨善恶。此事触怒了上帝。把他们逐出伊甸园。

现在亚当既被喻为“人类的始祖”，也被喻为“人类原始的罪恶本性”。后来出现习语the old Adam，意思就是“本性之恶”。比如：

He attributed his wild outburst to the old Adam in him.

他把自己的大发雷霆归因于本性之恶。

*大家可能会好奇为什么Adam前面要加一个“old”呢？其实这里的“old”不是“（年纪）老”的意思，而是指“旧的，过去的”，代表的是“堕落的人类”（fallen man）；后来有了the second/last Adam（也就是耶稣 “Jesus”）, 代表的是“脱去原罪、重新回归上帝恩典中的人类”。



\2. doubting Thomas

怀疑主义者

这个习语源自《圣经·新约》的“约翰福音”第20章中的一个故事：基督被钉死在十字架上后，第三天复活，出现在自己的门徒面前。但门徒（apostles）之一托马斯碰巧那天不在。由于没有亲眼看到基督，他不相信别人的话，不相信基督已经复活。

后来人们就用doubting Thomas指“多疑的人；怀疑主义者（必须要眼见为实）”（a skeptic who refuses to believe without direct personal experience）. 比如：

She’s a bit of a doubting Thomas and she won’t believe you’re back till she sees you.

她是个眼见为实的人——除非她亲眼看见你，否则绝不会相信你已经回来。



3.a mess of pottage

因小失大

a mess表示“一份（流质食物）”，比如a mess of porridge指“一碗粥”，pottage则是“浓汤”的意思（在这个故事里是“红豆汤”）。《圣经·旧约》的“创世纪”里记载道：雅各（Jacob）是以撒的儿子，也就是亚伯拉罕（Abraham）的孙子，与其兄以扫（Esau）争夺长子权。按照当时的风俗，长子以扫可以继承父亲的很多财产。一天，外出打猎的以扫疲倦归来十分口渴，而雅各正在煮红豆汤。功于心计的雅各乘人之危，于是以扫仅以一碗红豆汤便起誓把长子的名分卖给了雅各。

由此a mess of pottage就用来比喻“因为眼前的蝇头小利而付出高昂的低价”（If someone exchanges something of lasting value for a mess of pottage, they foolishly exchange it for something of no lasting value）. 比如：

I think he sold his birthright for a mess of pottage when he agreed to withdraw his candidacy in exchange for a peerage.

我想，他答应退出竞选换取贵族头衔，是因小失大了。



\4. make bricks without straw

做无草之砖

这个故事出自《圣经·旧约》的“出埃及”（Exodus）：摩西受上帝之命，成为在埃及做奴隶的以色列人的领袖。他向埃及国王提出要带以色列人离开埃及。埃及国王不允，认为是以色列人闲着没事干而闹事，遂下令不给以色列奴隶提供柴草，要他们自己寻找草梗去生火烧砖，但每天上交的砖的数量不得减少。结果以色列奴隶和埃及奴隶之间的矛盾加剧。

后来，人们用make bricks without straw来形容“要做一件事但缺乏必要的条件”，其实也就是我们说的“巧妇难为无米之炊”（to try to do a piece of work without the necessary materials, equipment or information）, 比如：

They don't give us nearly enough time or support to get these projects to the standards they should be, so we end up making bricks without straw.

他们希望这个项目能完成到一定的水准，但又没有给我们足够的时间和支持，最后我们就只是在做无米之炊。

明天的彩蛋我们会继续分享直接从《圣经》的用语里演变而来的英语习语哦~

One morning I went down to breakfast and the Englishman, Harris, was already at the table.

He was reading the paper through spectacles.

He looked up and smiled.

"Good morning," he said. "Letter for you.

I stopped at the post and they gave it me with mine."

The letter was at my place at the table, leaning against a coffeecup.

Harris was reading the paper again.

I opened the letter. It had been forwarded from Pamplona.

> ==forward==
>
> vt. 发送，寄（to send or pass goods or information to sb）

>
> 原文： It had been forwarded from Pamplona.
>
> 这封信是从潘普洛纳转来的。
>
> 💧forward 在这里是指“转寄”，另外它还可以表示“寄送”，尤其是向客户提交某些信息或目录时，比如：We will be forwarding you our new catalogue next week.
>
> 我们将于下星期给你寄上新的商品目录。

It was dated San Sebastian, Sunday:

Dear Jake, We got here Friday, Brett passed out on the train, so brought her here for 3 days rest with old friends of ours.

> <font color=red>Brett passed out on the train, so brought her here for 3 days rest with old friends of ours.</font>
>
> 勃莱特在火车上昏倒了，所以我带她到我们的老朋友这里来休息三天。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> pass out 表示“昏倒”（to faint or lose consciousness）, 比如：He felt sick and dizzy and then passed out.（他感觉恶心，眩晕，接着就昏倒了。）
>
> *这里也可能是指Brett醉倒了（经常发生在她身上的事）。

We go to Montoya Hotel Pamplona Tuesday, arriving at I don't know what hour.

Will you send a note by the bus to tell us what to do to rejoin you all on Wednesday.

All our love and sorry to be late, but Brett was really done in and will be quite all right by Tues. and is practically so now.

I know her so well and try to look after her but it's not so easy.

Love to all the chaps, Michael.

"What day of the week is it?" I asked Harris.

"Wednesday, I think. Yes, quite. Wednesday.

Wonderful how one loses track of the days up here in the mountains."

"Yes. We've been here nearly a week."

"I hope you're not thinking of leaving?"

"Yes. We'll go in on the afternoon bus, I'm afraid."

"What a rotten business. I had hoped we'd all have another go at the Irati together."

"We have to go into Pamplona. We're meeting people there."

"What rotten luck for me. We've had a jolly time here at Burguete."

> ==rotten英 [ˈrɒtn] 美 [ˈrɑ:tn] adj. 腐烂的；恶臭的；堕落的；极坏的 adv. 非常；极其==

"Come on in to Pamplona. We can play some bridge there, and there's going to be a damned fine fiesta."

"I'd like to. Awfully nice of you to ask me.

I'd best stop on here, though. I've not much more time to fish."

"You want those big ones in the Irati."

"I say, I do, you know. They're enormous trout there."

"I'd like to try them once more."

"Do. Stop over another day. Be a good chap."

"We really have to get into town," I said."What a pity."

After breakfast Bill and I were sitting warming in the sun on a bench out in front of the inn and talking it over.

I saw a girl coming up the road from the centre of the town.

She stopped in front of us and took a telegram out of the leather wallet that hung against her skirt.

"Por ustedes? ([西]是给你们的？)" I looked at it.

The address was: "Barnes, Burguete." "Yes. It's for us."

She brought out a book for me to sign, and I gave her a couple of coppers.

The telegram was in Spanish: "Vengo Jueves Cohn ([西]我星期四到——科恩)."

I handed it to Bill.

"What does the word Cohn mean?" he asked.

"What a lousy telegram!" I said.

"He could send ten words for the same price. I come Thursday'. That gives you a lot of dope, doesn't it?"

"We're going in, anyway," I said.

"There's no use trying to move Brett and Mike out here and back before the fiesta. Should we answer it?"

"We might as well," said Bill.

"There's no need for us to be snooty."

> ==snooty英 [ˈsnu:ti] 美 ['snu:tɪ] adj. <口>高傲自大的，媚上傲下的==

We walked up to the post-office and asked for a telegraph blank.

"What will we say?" Bill asked.

"Arriving to-night.' That's enough."

We paid for the message and walked back to the inn.

Harris was there and the three of us walked up to Roncesvalles.

We went through the monastery.

"It's remarkable place," Harris said, when we came out.

"But you know I'm not much on those sort of places."

"Me either," Bill said.

"It's a remarkable place, though," Harris said.

"I wouldn't not have seen it. I'd been intending coming up each day."

"It isn't the same as fishing, though, is it?" Bill asked.

He liked Harris. "I say not."

We were standing in front of the old chapel of the monastery.

> ==chapel英 [ˈtʃæpl] 美 [ˈtʃæpəl] n. 小教堂，附属教堂==

"Isn't that a pub across the way?" Harris asked. "Or do my eyes deceive me?"

"It has the look of a pub," Bill said.

"It looks to me like a pub," I said.

"I say," said Harris, "let's utilize it." He had taken up utilizing from Bill.

We had a bottle of wine apiece. Harris would not let us pay.

He talked Spanish quite well, and the innkeeper would not take our money.

"I say. You don't know what it's meant to me to have you chaps up here."

"We've had a grand time, Harris." Harris was a little tight.

"I say. Really you don't know how much it means.

I've not had much fun since the war."

"We'll fish together again, some time. Don't you forget it, Harris."

"We must. We have had such a jolly good time."

"How about another bottle around?"

"Jolly good idea," said Harris.

"This is mine," said Bill. "Or we don't drink it."

"I wish you'd let me pay for it. It does give me pleasure, you know."

"This is going to give me pleasure," Bill said.

The innkeeper brought in the fourth bottle. We had kept the same glasses.

Harris lifted his glass. "I say. You know this does utilize well."

Bill slapped him on the back."Good old Harris."

"I say. You know my name isn't really Harris.

It's Wilson Harris. All one name. With a hyphen, you know."

"Good old Wilson-Harris," Bill said.

"We call you Harris because we're so fond of you."

"I say, Barnes. You don't know what this all means to me."

"Come on and utilize another glass,"I said.

"Barnes. Really, Barnes, you can't know. That's all."

"Drink up, Harris."We walked back down the road from Roncesvalles with Harris between us.

We had lunch at the inn and Harris went with us to the bus.

He gave us his card, with his address in London and his club and his business address, and as we got on the bus he handed us each an envelope.

I opened mine and there were a dozen flies in it.

Harris had tied them himself. He tied all his own flies.

"I say, Harris--" I began.

"No, no!" he said. He was climbing down from the bus.

"They're not first-rate flies at all. I only thought if you fished them some time it might remind you of what a good time we had."

The bus started. Harris stood in front of the post-office. He waved.

As we started along the road he turned and walked back toward the inn.

"Say, wasn't that Harris nice?" Bill said.

"I think he really did have a good time."

"Harris? You bet he did." "I wish he'd come into Pamplona."

"He wanted to fish." "Yes.

You couldn't tell how English would mix with each other, anyway."

> mix with sb 表示“（和不熟悉的人）相处，交往”，也就是我们平时说的“社交”（to socialize）. mix well with sb 就是指“相处得很来，很合拍”，比如：Charlie doesn’t mix well with the other children.（查利与其他孩子合不来。）

"I suppose not."We got into Pamplona late in the afternoon and the bus stopped in front of the HotelMontoya.

Out in the plaza they were stringing electric-light wires to light the plaza for the fiesta.

> ==string英 [strɪŋ] 美 [strɪŋ] n. 串；绳子，带子；线丝 vt.上弦，调弦；使排成一行或一系列==

A few kids came up when the bus stopped, and a customs officer for the town made all the people getting down from the bus open their bundles on the sidewalk.

We went into the hotel and on the stairs I met Montoya.

He shook hands with us, smiling in his embarrassed way.

"Your friends are here," he said.

"Mr. Campbell?" "Yes. Mr. Cohn and Mr. Campbell and Lady Ashley."

He smiled as though there were something I would hear about.

"When did they get in?" "Yesterday. I've saved you the rooms you had."

"That's fine. Did you give Mr. Campbell the room on the plaza?"

"Yes. All the rooms we looked at."

"Where are our friends now?"

"I think they went to the pelota."

"And how about the bulls?"Montoya smiled. "To-night," he said.

"To-night at seven o'clock they bring in the Villar bulls, and to-morrow come the Miuras. Do you all go down?"

"Oh, yes. They've never seen a desencajonada ([西]“释放”，将公牛从笼子里放进牛栏)."

Montoya put his hand on my shoulder." I'll see you there."

He smiled again. He always smiled as though bull-fighting were a very special secret between the two of us; a rather shocking but really very deep secret that we knew about.

He always smiled as though there were something lewd about the secret to outsiders, but that it was something that we understood.

It would not do to expose it to people who would not understand.

### 背景知识

**💧Double-barrelled name**

**英文里的复姓**

"Good old Harris."

"I say. You know my name isn't really Harris. It's Wilson Harris. All one name. With a hyphen, you know."

“哈里斯，老伙计。”

“咳。你们知道我的姓氏实际上并不是哈里斯。是威尔逊-哈里斯。是个复姓。中间有个连字号，你们知道的吧。”

Harris在这里一本正经地解释自己的姓是个复姓，中间还有连字符（"-"）, 所以一定得连起来一起读（"Wilson-Harris"）. 复姓在英文里叫作Double name或Double-barrelled name（double-barrelled表示“双重的，有两部分的”），当然还有更直接的表示：Hyphenated name（加了连字符的姓）。

在英国，复姓一般是在家族中一代代继承下来的（heritable）. 有少数上层贵族还有三重姓（triple-barrelled）, 更罕有的还有四重姓（quintuple-barrelled）. 

但拥有多重姓的并不一定都是贵族（of the peerage），也有可能是出身于地主阶级（landed gentry），这种时候取复姓的目的一般是为了巩固属于这个家族的地产和财富（to consolidate the estates and wealth of the family）. 

当然姓氏太长使用起来会很不方便，所以后来也有很多人在日常中会把自己的多重姓缩写为两重，或者甚至只剩一个（abbreviated in everyday use to a single or double-barrelled version）.

除了家族继承，在某些情况下也会有人特意把自己的姓变成复姓。比如按照西方的传统，结婚后女方需要决定是否保留自己的姓氏，还是随夫姓。但也有人选择保留自己的娘家姓（maiden name）, 同时再用“-”把夫家的姓加在后面。这对既想保留自己的姓氏，又想表明自己已婚身份的女士来说可以算是两全其美了。

### 课文理解

Jake和Bill为了和Mike以及Brett在潘普洛纳会合，立马决定要起身回程。但跟他们才相处了短短5天的另一位英国人Harris却对他们非常不舍。这里再次出现了海明威在这本小说中一直反复强调的主题，也就是男性之间的友谊，尤其是一战的退伍士兵之间的——

💧**Clue 1**: Male freiendship, especially that is between combat veterans, is celebrated.



**Evidence 1**: Harris was a little tight.

"I say. Really you don't know how much it means. I've not had much fun since the war."

哈里斯有点醉了。

“我说，你们真不知道对我的意义有多大。大战结束以来我就没过过几天开心日子。”



**Evidence 2**: "No, no!" he said. He was climbing down from the bus. "They're not first-rate flies at all. I only thought if you fished them some time it might remind you of what a good time we had."

“别，别！”他说。他正从汽车上往下爬。“根本算不上头等的假蝇钓钩。我只希望尼恩有朝一日拿它来钓鱼的时候，能想起咱们一起度过的这段快乐的时光。”



Harris透露了自己也是参加完一战回来的，并且一直都生活得闷闷不乐，直到遇上Jake和Bill，他们三个都有相似的经历，所以彼此之间也更加有共鸣和联结感。这种在战场上发展出来的“兄弟情谊”可以说在一定程度上帮助了他们重返平凡的现实生活时，能获得情感的支撑和安慰。

比如在之前的章节里，Bill也向Jake表达了他的这层感情："Listen. You're a hell of a good guy, and I'm fonder of you than anybody on earth."（“听着，你是个大好人，我喜欢你，胜过世界上任何一个人。”）虽然他又紧接着打趣说如果放在纽约，自己这么说就会被当成同性恋者了（" I couldn't tell you that in New York. It'd mean I was a faggot."）也可以理解为这暗示了这种友谊同时兼具深刻性和复杂性，很多时候是难以衡量并把握的（参考海明威自身的经历，他也有不少和男性之间的友谊）。

在今天内容的结尾部分，还有一段关于潘普洛纳的旅馆老板Montoya的描写，读起来含义似乎非常暧昧不明。其中提到了一个很有意思的概念——outsider（局外人），如果我们仔细回想，就会发现这本小说当中的人物都或多或少地会有意和彼此之间发展一种秘密关系——



💧**Clue 2**: The tendency of building secretive relationship.



**Evidence 1**: We went into the hotel and on the stairs I met Montoya. He shook hands with us, smiling in his embarrassed way.

在楼梯上我碰到蒙托亚。他同我们握手，面带他那惯常的扭捏表情微笑着。



**Evidence 2**: He always smiled as though there were something lewd about the secret to outsiders, but that it was something that we understood. It would not do to expose it to people who would not understand.

他总是笑眯眯的，似乎对外人来说，这秘密是桩不可告人的丑事，但是我们却心照不宣。这秘密是不便于在不懂得其中奥妙的人面前公开的。



Jake觉得自己和Montoya有一种亲密感，仿佛他们之间的交流都是秘密性的（secretive）, 而且不能够和别人分享，也就是“排外的”（exclusive）. 这种情感和关系在某种程度上也反映了在当时整个时代环境之下，人和人之间的信任感是很低的，并且距离疏远，充斥着冷漠，所以这种关系更能带来安全感和心理上的安慰——也就是只跟和自己相似或是有特定感觉的人亲近。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧English Idioms from Bible**

**来自《圣经》的英语习语（下）**

昨天我们分享的是从《圣经》的人物故事延伸而来的习语，但其实还有相当一部分习语是直接从《圣经》里的原话演变过来的，今天的彩蛋我们再一起来看一看~

\1. the apple of one’s eye

掌上明珠

这个出现在《圣经·旧约》的诗篇（Psalms）里：“求你保护我，如同保护眼睛中的瞳孔。”（Keep me as the apple of the eye.）以前的人因为瞳孔（pupil）和苹果的形状很相似而称之为apple. 这句话原本是向上帝的祷告，现在它被用来比喻“很珍贵的人或物，掌上明珠”（special favorite, beloved person or thing）. 比如：

She is the apple of her parents’ eye, but she is not spoiled.

她是父母的掌上明珠，但并没被宠坏。



\2. all things to all men

对什么样的人，就做什么样的人

在《圣经·新约》的哥林多前书（Corinthians）里有使徒保罗说：“对什么样的人，我就做什么样的人，这样我就能尽一切办法拯救他们中的一些人。”（So I become all things to all men, that I may save some of them by whatever means possible.）

现在这一习语的意思是“八面玲珑，力图讨好所有的人”（to be liked or appreciated by everyone, usually through overt efforts to please them）. 比如：

The President’s attempts to be all things to all men had disastrous consequences.

总统企图讨好各方的做法招致了灾难性的后果。

You can’t be all things to all men. Just make up your mind.

你不可能让所有人都高兴，做出自己的决定吧。



\3. broken reed

折断的芦草

这一习语源出《圣经·旧约》以赛亚书（Isaiah）：“压伤的芦草不折断，冒烟的亚麻不熄火。”（A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench.）原文里是赞美上帝的慈爱，但broken reed现在的意思是指“靠不住的人”（an unreliable or unsupportive person）, 比如：

He let me down at the last minute and turned out to be a broken reed．

他在紧急关头拆了我的台，成了背信弃义的人。

Don’t trust him; he has heen proved to be abroken reed.

不要信任他，他已经被证明了是一个靠不住的人。



\4. clean hands

双手干净

在《圣经·旧约》约伯记（the book of Job）中写道：“双手干净的人会越来越有力。” 早在中世纪的英语中clean就作“廉洁”解，而dirty则作“贪污”解。该习语多与have，with或者come out with等词连用，表示“作风清廉”（freedom from guilt, wrongdoing, or dishonesty）. 比如：

He had clean hands during his ten years of government service.

他当官10年，两袖清风。

How can you expect to win confidence of the people unless you come to them with clean hands．

你如何能赢得人民的信任，除非你以廉洁之身和他们打交道。



\5. whited sepulcher

粉刷过的坟墓

在《圣经·新约》马太福音（Matthew）里上帝斥责文士（the teachers of the Law）和法利赛人是口是心非的伪君子，他们“好像粉刷过的坟墓，外表好看，里面却装满死人的骨头和尸体。”（You are like whited sepulcher, which look fine on the outside but are full of bones and decaying corpses on the inside.）

后来人们就用whited sepulcher（粉刷过的坟墓）来比喻“伪君子”（a hypocrite, who is inwardly evil but outwardly professes to be virtuous）. 比如：

He was a complete whited sepulcher, who induced the public to vote for him.

他诱骗公众投票选他，他就是一彻头彻尾的伪君子。

## Chapter 13.2

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/f7cf6392aec820735672931a69ad5c8d-sz_264338.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)

"Your friend, is he aficionado (斗牛迷), too?" Montoya smiled at Bill.

"Yes. He came all the way from New York to see the San Fermines (圣福明节)."

"Yes?" Montoya politely disbelieved. " But he's not aficionado like you."

He put his hand on my shoulder again embarrassedly.

"Yes," I said. "He's a real aficionado."

"But he's not aficionado like you are."

Aficion means passion. An aficionado is one who is passionate about the bull-fights.

All the good bull-fighters stayed at Montoya's hotel; that is, those with aficion stayed there.

The commercial bullfighters stayed once, perhaps, and then did not come back.

The good ones came each year. In Montoya's room were their photographs.

The photographs were dedicated to Juanito Montoya or to his sister.

The photographs of bull-fighters Montoya had really believed in wereframed.

Photographs of bull-fighters who had been without aficion Montoya kept in a drawer of his desk.

They often had the most flattering inscriptions. But they did not mean anything.

> ==inscription==
>
> n. 碑文；（作者）题词；献词（words written in the front of a book or cut in stone or metal）
>
> 原文：They often had the most flattering inscriptions.
>
> 这些照片上往往有过分谄媚的题词。
>
> 💧inscription 在这里是指来Montoya的旅馆入住的斗牛士们在照片上留下的祝语；另外inscription还可以指碑文，或者是奖章上的题字，比如：The medal bears the inscription"For distinguished service." 
>
> 那块奖章上刻有“功勋卓著”的字样。

One day Montoya took them all out and dropped them in the waste-basket. He did not want them around.

We often talked about bulls and bull-fighters.

I had stopped at the Montoya for several years.

We never talked for very long at a time.

It was simply the pleasure of discovering what we each felt.

Men would come in from distant towns and before they left Pamplona stop and talk for a few minutes with Montoya about bulls.

These men were aficionados. Those who were aficionados could always get rooms even when the hotel was full.

Montoya introduced me to some of them.

They were always very polite at first, and it amused them very much that I should be an American.

Somehow it was taken for granted that an American could not have aficion.

He might simulate it or confuse it with excitement, but he could not really have it.

> ==simulate英 [ˈsɪmjuleɪt] 美 [ˈsɪmjəˌlet] vt. 模拟；模仿；假装，冒充==

>
> 原文：He might simulate it or confuse it with excitement, but he could not really have it.
>
> 他可能假装热爱，或者把激动当作热爱，但是他不可能真正具备这份热爱。
>
> 💧这里的simulate it就是指pretend to have aficion (enthusiasm) “佯装热情”，simulate相当于feign的用法，比如：He found it impossible to simulate/feign grief.
>
> 他无法装出悲伤的样子。

When they saw that I had aficion, and there was no password, no set questions that could bring it out, rather it was a sort of oral spiritual examination with the questions always a little on the defensive and never apparent,

there was this same embarrassed putting the hand on the shoulder, or a "Buen hombre ([西]好人，好汉)."

> ==defensive英 [dɪˈfensɪv] 美 [dɪˈfɛnsɪv] adj. 防御用的，防守的；辩护的；自卫的==
>
> <font color=red>When they saw that I had aficion, / and there was no password, no set questions that could bring it out, / rather it was a sort of oral spiritual examination / with the questions always a little on the defensive and never apparent, / there was this same embarrassed putting the hand on the shoulder, or a "Buen hombre."</font>
>
> 等他们发现我具备这份热爱——这不是什么暗语，也不是用一套特定的提问所能探测出来的，毋宁说是用一些小心翼翼而吞吞吐吐的问题在口头上进行心灵的测验而发现的——就同样会扭捏地把手按在我的肩上，或者说一声“Buen hombre”（“好伙子”）。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①bring sth out 在这里指“使显露出来”（reveal or expose sth）, 比如： His book brought out some new facts about the war.（他的书为这场战争提供了新的事实论据。）
>
> ②on the defensive 本义是“处于戒备状态的，存有戒心的”（behaving in a way that shows that you think that someone is criticizing you even if they are not）, 注意defensive在这里是名词。
>
> *这句话说的是当斗牛迷在确认同伴的时候，并没有固定寻常的提问或者约定好的暗号，而是通过口头上的一些试探，往往还是小心翼翼而且闪烁其词的。在确认之后，他们的表现一般是扭捏地把手放在对方肩上，或者说一句“Buen hombre”. 当他们确认Jake也是斗牛迷后就是这么对他做的（同时this same要结合上文来理解，Montoya对Jake也做了这件事情：He put his hand on my shoulder again embarassedly）

But nearly always there was the actual touching.

It seemed as though they wanted to touch you to make it certain.

Montoya could forgive anything of a bull-fighter who had aficion.

He could forgive attacks of nerves, panic, bad unexplainable actions, allsorts of lapses.

> ==lapse英 [læps] 美 [læps] n. 流逝；小错，疏忽；行为失检，失足；[法]（权利等的）失效 vi. 退步；陷入，堕入；失效，终止==
>
> <font color=red>He could forgive attacks of nerves, panic, bad unexplainable actions, all sorts of lapses.</font>
>
> 他可以宽恕突然发作的歇斯底里，惊慌失措，恶劣的莫名其妙的动作，各种各样的失礼。
>
> **💧表达精讲**

> ①attack 在这里不是指“攻击”哦~ 而是“（疾病急性）发作”（a sudden short period of suffering from an illness, especially an illness that you have often），比如heart attack “心脏病发作”；an attack of flu “患上流感”等；
>
> ②nerves 作为复数形式可以指“神经紧张”（feelings of anxiety or tension）, 比如：I just played badly. It wasn't nerves.（我就是演得不好，不是紧张。）
>
> ③lapse 表示“（一时的）行为有失检点”（a moment or instance of bad behaviour by someone who usually behaves well）, 比如：On Friday he showed neither decency nor dignity. It was an uncommon lapse.（星期五他既不庄重也不体面。这可是他少有的失礼。）

For one who had aficion he could forgive anything. At once he forgave me all my friends.

> <font color=red>At once he forgave me all my friends.</font>
>
> 因此他马上原谅我，不去追究我那些朋友的底细。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> forgave me all my friends 可以理解为 forgave me for being among the circle of my friends. 大概意思是Montoya并不是很喜欢Jake的朋友们，比如可能因为他们对斗牛没有真正的热情，只是来看个热闹，但因为Jake是斗牛迷，所以他对Jake的圈子也持宽容态度。

Without his ever saying anything they were simply a little something shameful between us, like the spilling open of the horses in bull-fighting.

> <font color=red>Without his ever saying anything / they were simply a little something shameful between us, / like the spilling open of the horses in bull-fighting.</font>
>
> 他一字不提他们的事儿，他们不过是我们彼此之间羞于提起的事儿，就像斗牛场上马儿被牛角挑得肠子都流出来这事那样。
>
> **💧句式拆解**
>
> Without his ever saying anything 可以看作现在分词结构作伴随状语哦~
>
> *“他”也就是Montoya，而“他们”则是指Jake的朋友们。因为Jake和Montoya都是斗牛迷，而Jake的朋友们并没有对斗牛真正的热情，所以他们便把这些人都排除在外，看成是“异类”（借用昨天内容出现的一个词：outsiders）. 这里作者用了一个不太令人舒适的比喻来形容Jake和Montoya不屑于提起Jake的朋友：就像他们会回避去提起斗牛场上被牛角剖开肚子的马匹，仿佛是一桩丑事不便外扬似的。

Bill had gone up-stairs as we came in, and I found him washing and changing in his room.

"Well," he said, "talk a lot of Spanish?"

"He was telling me about the bulls coming in tonight."

"Let's find the gang and go down."

"All right. They'll probably be at the café."

"Have you got tickets?" "Yes. I got them for all the unloadings."

> <font color=red>"Have you got tickets?"</font>

"What's it like?" He was pulling his cheek before the glass, looking to see if there were unshaved patches under the line of the jaw.

"It's pretty good," I said. "They let the bulls out of the cages one at a time, and they have steers in the corral to receive them and keep them from fighting,

and the bulls tear in at the steers and the steers run around like old maids trying to quiet them down."

>
> **💧知识拓展**
>
> steer 指“阉割过的小公牛”（a young male cow whose sex organs have been removed）, 这种牛被称为“犍牛”，一般性情温顺，没有发情期，没有交配和求偶行为，既没有对人的伤害，也不会因为争夺配偶与其他公牛产生争斗。

"Do they ever gore the steers?" "Sure. Sometimes they go right after them and kill them."

"Can't the steers do anything?" "No. They're trying to make friends."

"What do they have them in for?"

"To quiet down the bulls and keep them from breaking their horns against the stone walls, or goring each other."

"Must be swell being a steer."

We went down the stairs and out of the door and walked across the square toward the café Iruña.

There were two lonely looking ticket-houses standing in the square.

Their windows, marked SOL, SOL YSOMBRA, and SOMBRA ([西]指头牛场中三个档次的座位：向阳的、半向阳的、背阴的),were shut.

They would not open until the day before the fiesta.

Across the square the white wicker tables and chairs of the Iruña extended out beyond the Arcade to the edge of the street.

I looked for Brett and Mike at the tables. There they were.

Brett and Mike and Robert Cohn. Brett was wearing a Basque beret.

So was Mike. Robert Cohn was bare-headed and wearing his spectacles.

Brett saw us coming and waved. Her eyes crinkled up as we came up to the table.

> ==crinkle英 [ˈkrɪŋkl] 美 [ˈkrɪŋkəl] vt.& vi. （使）起皱 n. （布或纸上的）皱纹==

"Hello, you chaps!" she called.

Brett was happy. Mike had a way of getting an intensity of feeling into shaking hands.

Robert Cohn shook hands because we were back.

"Where the hell have you been?" I asked.

"I brought them up here," Cohn said.

"What rot," Brett said. "We'd have gotten here earlier if you hadn't come."

"You'd never have gotten here."

"What rot! You chaps are brown. Look at Bill."

"Did you get good fishing?" Mike asked. "We wanted to join you."

"It wasn't bad. We missed you."

"I wanted to come," Cohn said, "but I thought I ought to bring them."

"You bring us. What rot."

"Was it really good?" Mike asked. "Did you take many?"

"Some days we took a dozen apiece. There was an Englishman up there."

"Named Harris," Bill said. "Ever know him, Mike? He was in the war,too."

"Fortunate fellow," Mike said. "What times we had. How I wish those dear days were back."

"I'll not. I've told that four times."

"You never told me," Robert Cohn said.

> reflect discredit on sb 可以理解为bring discredit on sb “败坏某人的名誉，让某人丢脸”（to cause sb to lose other people's respect or trust）. 比如：The behaviour of fans has brought discredit on English football.（球迷的行为败坏了英格兰足球的名誉。）

"What story's that?" "Brett will tell you. She tells all the stories that reflect discredit on me."

"Go on. Tell it, Brett." "Should I?" "I'll tell it myself."

"What medals have you got, Mike?" "I haven't got any medals."

"You must have some." "I suppose I've the usual medals. But I never sent in for them.

One time there was this whopping big dinner and the Prince of Wales was to be there, and the cards said medals will be worn.

> ==whopping英 [ˈwɒpɪŋ] 美 [ˈwɑ:pɪŋ] adj. 巨大的，庞大的 adv. 非常地，异常地==

So naturally I had no medals, and I stopped at my tailor's and he was impressed by the invitation, and I thought that's a good piece of business, and I said to him:

You've got to fix me up with some medals.' He said: 'What medals, sir?'

And I said: 'Oh, any medals. Just give me a few medals.'

So he said: 'What medals have you,sir?' And I said: 'How should I know?'

Did he think I spent all my time reading the bloody gazette?

> ==gazette英 [gəˈzet] 美 [ɡəˈzɛt] n. 公报；报纸（作报纸名） vt. 刊载，宣布；任命==

So he got me some medals, you know, miniature medals, and handed me the box, and I put it in my pocket and forgot it.

Well, I went to the dinner, and it was the night they'd shot Henry Wilson, so the Prince didn't come and the King didn't come, and no one wore any medals,

and all these coves were busy taking off their medals, and I had mine in my pocket."

He stopped for us to laugh." Is that all?"

"That's all. Perhaps I didn't tell it right."

"You didn't," said Brett. " But no matter."

We were all laughing.

**💧****History of bullfighting in Spain**

**西班牙斗牛史**

西班牙斗牛最早可以追溯到西班牙古代宗教活动（杀牛供神祭品）（Bullfighting traces its roots to prehistoric bull worship and sacrifice）, 比如在阿尔达米拉岩洞中发现的新石器时代的岩壁画里，还有记录着人与牛搏斗的描绘。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/7522e10eef8115a15e6f60a9e5f37a90-sz_774578.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



在中世纪，斗牛仍然是一项贵族运动，因为饲养和训练马匹的都需要一定的花费（In medieval Spain bullfighting was considered a noble sport and reserved to the rich, who could afford to supply and train their animals）. 最早的斗牛形式：在一个封闭的场子里，斗牛士骑在马背上拿着长矛单独和公牛搏斗（The bull was released into a closed arena where a single fighter on horseback was armed with a lance）. 

但到了18世纪中期，波旁王朝统治时期，第一位国王菲利佩五世对于这项运动深恶痛绝，认为这种容易对皇室成员造成伤害的残酷运动应该被禁止。此后，这一传统贵族专利就从皇宫传到了民间。

现在从每年的3月19日——圣约瑟夫日开始，到10月12日西班牙国庆节这长达7个月的时期，成为斗牛季。其中3月时在瓦伦西亚著名的火祭节（Fallas festival）以及6月时在格拉纳达的圣体节（Corpus Christi）都将进行一系列隆重的斗牛赛。另外，普及到民众中的就是一年一度的奔牛节（即“圣福明节”，Festival of San Fermin），也就是我们的主角们正要去参加的这场狂欢节哦~

在斗牛的选用上，西班牙斗牛（Spanish Matador）选用的公牛是一种血统纯正的野性动物，一般是生性暴烈的北非公牛，它们由特殊的驯养场负责牛种培育，经过四到五年即可用于比赛。但公牛好斗的本性不是经人训练出来的，而是其天生的。

另外在西班牙，斗牛士的地位也高出一般的社会名流和演艺界人士。他们被认为是“高雅”和“勇敢”的象征。而且斗牛其实并非男子的专利，在20世纪30年代之前一直都有女性参与这项运动，只是后来女斗牛士遭到了禁止。但近十年来，又有不少女性陆续投身到这项勇敢者的挑战中。

### 课文理解

今天的内容主要是关于Jake和酒店老板Montoya之间的关于斗牛迷的对话，以及一行人重聚之后的交谈。首先是关于Jake的身份，他是一个十足的斗牛迷，文中有不少细节都在反复强调这一点。这也解释了我们昨天分析中提到的，Jake和Montoya仿佛有一层秘密关系，并且Jake的朋友们都被排除在外了——

💧**Clue 1**: Jake is a bullfighting fanatic.



**Evidence 1**: "Yes?" Montoya politely disbelieved. "But he's not aficionado like you."

He put his hand on my shoulder again embarrassedly.

“是吗？”蒙托亚客气地表示怀疑。“但是他不像你那么着迷。”

他又扭捏地把手搭在我的肩上。



**Evidence 2**: We often talked about bulls and bull-fighters. I had stopped at the Montoya for several years.

我们经常谈论公牛和斗牛士。我一连几年都到蒙托亚旅馆小住。



这里透露了Jake每年都到潘普洛纳来看奔牛节，所以Montoya对他格外有好感。并且还把他介绍给自己同为斗牛迷的朋友们（Montoya introduced me to some of them）. 他们和Jake打招呼的方式也和Montoya一样，带有扭捏和不自然，显得很隐秘（...there was this same embarrassed putting the hand on the shoulder, or a "Buen hombre"）.

那么Jake对斗牛的热爱从何而来，以及这又对他的生活产生了什么影响呢？有一个细节：在小说开篇的时候，Cohn向Jake抱怨生活的无趣平淡，Jake则对他说了一句："Nobody ever lives their life all the way up except bullfighters."（“除了斗牛士，没有人的人生是一路高歌猛进的。”）这样看来，这句话就说得非常意味深长了。具体的含义我们会在之后的情节发展里再进行剖析~

今天还有一处细节是关于Cohn的，他似乎对大家的团聚表现得非常悻悻然——



💧**Clue 2**: Cohn doesn't appear to be excited about getting together.



**Evidence 1**: Brett was happy. Mike had a way of getting an intensity of feeling into shaking hands. Robert Cohn shook hands because we were back.

勃莱特很高兴。迈克有种本领，能在握手中灌注强烈的感情。罗伯特·科恩同我们握手是因为我们赶回来了。

Cohn的冷淡表现似乎非常符合他一直以来的人物设定，但通过握手这个动作，也刻画出了他和这群人格格不入的一面——他缺乏激情以及和人交往时的亲近，这一点在他之后的很多行为表现上都会得到印证。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****英语里表示“…狂/迷”的尾缀**

今天的内容里出现了一个词aficionado, 在西班牙语里它表示“狂热爱好者，…迷”。这个词语也在19世纪进入了英语当中，所以平时也是可以直接使用的哦~ 比如：I happen to be an aficionado of the opera, and I love art museums.（碰巧我是个歌剧迷，而且喜欢艺术馆。）

其实除了aficionado和我们熟悉的fan/fanatic可以直接用来表示“…迷，狂”，在英语里还有各种可以放在名词后面修饰的尾缀来表达这个意思哦~

\1. -aholic/-oholic

-aholic/-oholic源自“alcoholic”（酒鬼，嗜酒者），表示“沉湎于…的人；对…有嗜好的人”。

比如：a computerholic（计算机迷）、a cardaholic（牌迷）、a movieholic（电影迷）、a workaholic（工作狂）、a shopaholic（购物狂）、a surgiholic（整容狂）、a bookaholic（爱书狂）、a colaholic（嗜饮可乐的人）、a chocoholic（嗜吃巧克力的人）等等。



\2. -goer

-goer作为组合形式与其他名词复合使用，表示“常去…的人”，间接表达“…迷”之意。

比如：a cinema/film-goer（电影迷）、a theatre/opera-goer（戏迷/歌剧迷）、a concert-goer（音乐会迷）等。

*当然有的情况下-goer就只是单纯表示“参加……活动的人”哦~



\3. -mania/-maniac

mania/maniac是心理学术语，原指“癫狂/躁狂症者”。现常用来构成复合名词，表示“…迷”，“…狂”，“…癖”。

比如：a religious/football/fishing/disco/china maniac（宗教迷/足球迷/钓鱼迷/蹦迪迷/瓷器收藏迷）、kleptomania/kleptomaniac（偷窃狂，盗窃癖）、bibliomania/bibliomaniac（藏书癖，集书狂）、xenomania（外国迷，媚外狂）等。



\4. -nik

前苏联1957年发射了人类第一颗人造地球卫星“sputnik”。“sputnik”在俄语中是“旅伴”的意思。从中提取出来的“-nik”除了表示“以…为特征的人”，“参与/介入…的人”等新义之外，还表示“热衷于…的人”。

比如：a computer-nik（电脑迷）、a cinenik/filmnik（电影迷）、a folknik（民歌迷）、a jazznik（爵士迷）、a jobnik（工作迷）、a citynik（都市迷）、a peacenik（和平爱好者）等。

"Ah, yes," said Mike. "I know now.

It was a damn dull dinner, and I couldn't stick it, so I left.

Later on in the evening I found the box in my pocket.

What's this? I said. Medals? Bloody military medals?

So I cut them all off their backing —you know, they put them on a strip — and gave them all around.

Gave one to each girl. Form of souvenir. They thought I was hell's own shakes of a soldier.

>
> *hell's own 也是口语里的语气词，没有具体含义。

"Tell the rest," Brett said.

"Don't you think that was funny?" Mike asked.

We were all laughing. "It was. I swear it was. Any rate, my tailor wrote me and wanted the medals back.

Sent a man around. Kept on writing for months.

Seems some chap had left them to be cleaned. Frightfully military cove.

Set hell's own store by them." Mike paused.

"Rotten luck for the tailor," he said.

"You don't mean it," Bill said. "I should think it would have been grand for the tailor."

"Frightfully good tailor. Never believe it to see me now," Mike said.

"I used to pay him a hundred pounds a year just to keep him quiet.

So he wouldn't send me any bills. Frightful blow to him when I went bankrupt.

It was right after the medals. Gave his letters rather a bitter tone."

"How did you go bankrupt?" Bill asked.

"Two ways," Mike said. "Gradually and then suddenly."

"What brought it on?" "Friends," said Mike.

"I had a lot of friends. False friends.Then I had creditors, too. Probably had more creditors than anybody in England."

> ==creditor英 [ˈkredɪtə(r)] 美 [ˈkrɛdɪtɚ] n. 债权人，债主==

"Tell them about in the court," Brett said.

"I don't remember," Mike said. "I was just a little tight."

"Tight!" Brett exclaimed. "You were blind!"

"Extraordinary thing," Mike said. "Met my former partner the other day. Offered to buy me a drink."

"Tell them about your learned counsel," Brett said.

"I will not," Mike said. "My learned counsel was blind, too.

I say this is a gloomy subject. Are we going down and see these bulls unloaded or not?"

"Let's go down."

We called the waiter, paid, and started to walk through the town.

I started off walking with Brett, but Robert Cohn came up and joined her on the other side.

The three of us walked along, past the Ayuntamiento (市政厅) with the banners hung from the balcony, down past the market and down past the steep street that led to the bridge across the Arga (阿尔加河).

There were many people walking to go and see the bulls, and carriages drove down the hill and across the bridge, the drivers, the horses, and the whips rising above the walking people in the street.

Across the bridge we turned up a road to the corrals.

We passed a wineshop with a sign in the window: Good Wine 30 Centimes A Liter.

"That's where we'll go when funds get low," Brett said.

> <font color=red>"That's where we'll go when funds get low," Brett said.</font>

>
> *Brett在这里是讽刺这家卖酒的店档次不高（We passed a wineshop with a sign in the window: Good Wine 30 Centimes A Liter）.

The woman standing in the door of the wine-shop looked at us as we passed.

She called to some one in the house and three girls came to the window and stared.

They were staring at Brett. At the gate of the corrals two men took tickets from the people that went in.

We went in through the gate. There were trees inside and a low, stone house.

At the far end was the stone wall of the corrals, with apertures in the stone that were like loop-holes running all along the face of each corral.

> ==aperture英 [ˈæpətʃə(r)] 美 [ˈæpətʃɚ] n. 孔径;孔，洞;（照相机，望远镜等的）光圈==

A ladder led up to the top of the wall, and people were climbing up the ladder and spreading down to stand on the walls that separated the two corrals.

As we came up the ladder, walking across the grass under the trees, we passed the big, gray painted cages with the bulls in them.

There was one bull in each travelling-box.

They had come by train from a bull-breeding ranch in Castile, and had been unloaded off flat-cars at the station and brought up here to be let out of their cages into the corrals.

Each cage was stencilled with the name and the brand of the bull-breeder.

> ==stencil英 [ˈstensl] 美 [ˈstɛnsəl] n. 模板;蜡纸;用模板印出的文字或图案 vt. 用模板印刷;用蜡纸印刷==

We climbed up and found a place on the wall looking down into the corral.

The stone walls were whitewashed, and there was straw on the ground and wooden feed-boxes and water-troughs set against the wall.

> ==trough==
>
> n. 槽；饲料槽；饮水槽（a long narrow open container for animals to eat or drink from）

> 原文：The stone walls were whitewashed, and there was straw on the ground and wooden feed-boxes and water-troughs set against the wall.

>
> 长期以来失业率一直时起时伏。

"Look up there," I said.

Beyond the river rose the plateau of the town.

All along the old walls and ramparts people were standing.

> ==rampart英 [ˈræmpɑ:t] 美 [ˈræmpɑ:rt] n. （城堡等周围宽阔的）防御土墙;防御，保护==

The three lines of fortifications made three black lines of people.

Above the walls there were heads in the windows of the houses.

At the far end of the plateau boys had climbed into the trees.

"They must think something is going to happen," Brett said.

"They want to see the bulls."

Mike and Bill were on the other wall across the pit of the corral.

They waved to us. People who had come late were standing behind us, pressing against us when other people crowded them.

"Why don't they start?" Robert Cohnasked.

A single mule was hitched to one of the cages and dragged it up against the gate in the corral wall.

The men shoved and lifted it with crowbars into position against the gate.

Men were standing on the wall ready to pull up the gate of the corral and then the gate of the cage.

At the other end of the corral a gate opened and two steers came in, swaying their heads and trotting, their lean flanks swinging.

They stood together at the far end, their heads toward the gate where the bull would enter.

"They don't look happy," Brett said.

The men on top of the wall leaned back and pulled up the door of the corral.

Then they pulled up the door of the cage.

I leaned way over the wall and tried to see into the cage. It was dark.

Some one rapped on the cage with an iron bar. Inside something seemed to explode.

The bull, striking into the wood from side to side with his horns, made a great noise.

Then I saw a dark muzzle and the shadow of horns, and then, with a clattering on the wood in the hollow box, the bull charged and came out into the corral, skidding with his forefeet in the straw as he stopped,

> ==muzzle英 [ˈmʌzl] 美 [ˈmʌzəl] n. 枪口，炮口;（防止动物咬人的）口套 vt. 给（狗等）戴口套;使缄默，钳制…言论==

his head up, the great hump of muscle on his neck swollen tight, his body muscles quivering as he looked up at the crowd on the stonewalls.

The two steers backed away against the wall, their heads sunken, their eyes watching the bull.

The bull saw them and charged.

A man shouted from behind one of the boxes and slapped his hat against the planks, and the bull, before he reached the steer, turned,gathered himself and charged where the man had been, trying to reach him behind the planks with a half-dozen quick, searching drives with the right horn.

"My God, isn't he beautiful?" Brett said. We were looking right down on him.

"Look how he knows how to use his horns," I said. "He's got a left and a right just like a boxer."

"Not really?" "You watch."

"It goes too fast." "Wait. There'll be another one in a minute."

They had backed up another cage into the entrance.

In the far corner a man, from behind one of the plank shelters, attracted the bull, and while the bull was facing away the gate was pulled up and a second bull came out into the corral.

He charged straight for the steers and two men ran out from behind the planks and shouted, to turn him.

He did not change his direction and the men shouted: "Hah! Hah! Toro!" and waved their arms;

the two steers turned sideways to take the shock, and the bull drove into one of the steers.

"Don't look," I said to Brett. She was watching, fascinated.

"Fine," I said. "If it doesn't buck you."

"I saw it," she said. "I saw him shift from his left to his right horn."

"Damn good!"The steer was down now, his neck stretched out, his head twisted, he lay the way he had fallen.

Suddenly the bull left off and made for the other steer which had been standing at the far end, his head swinging, watching it all.

The steer ran awkwardly and the bull caught him, hooked him lightly in the flank, and then turned away and looked up at the crowd on the walls, his crest of muscle rising.

The steer came up to him and made as though to nose at him and the bull hooked perfunctorily.

The next time he nosed at the steer and then the two of them trotted over to the other bull.

When the next bull came out, all three, the two bulls and the steer, stood together, their heads side by side, their horns against the newcomer.

In a few minutes the steer picked the new bull up, quieted him down, and made him one of the herd.

When the last two bulls had been unloaded the herd were all together.

The steer who had been gored had gotten to his feet and stood against the stone wall.

None of the bulls came near him, and he did not attempt to join the herd.

### 背景知识

**💧****西班牙建筑风格特点**

我们在前面的内容里读到了不少对西班牙当地建筑的描写，比如最典型的就是刷成白色的外墙（We passed lots of Basques with oxen, or cattle, hauling carts along the road, and nice farmhouses, low roofs, and all white-plastered. — Chapter 10.1）. 今天我们就来系统了解一下西班牙的建筑风格和特点~

\1. 鲜明的白墙红瓦

白墙、红瓦，层次鲜明起伏的屋面，让大多的西班牙建筑拥有非常优美的变化曲线。红陶筒瓦、STUCCO手工抹灰墙以及铁艺窗等建筑元素都有意突显出其手工艺术的特点，并且每一个细节都精雕细琢，采用的建筑材料一般也都会给人斑驳的、手工的、比较旧的感觉，整个建筑看上去充满手工的质感。

除此以外，他们在视觉上还有很强的亲和感，生态性能也极佳（比如红陶土筒瓦是通过泥土烧制而成，环保吸水，可以保持屋内温度），营造出柔和、尊贵而又充满质感的生活氛围。



\2. 合理的空间规划

西班牙建筑还讲究空间的合理规划分配，且绝不会忽略建筑对人的情感与空间景观的照顾。不仅仅只是在卧室、客厅等基本功能上，更在立体的空间搭配使用上追求尽善尽美，像露台、花园、庭院、阳台等部分一点也不含糊。整个建筑常常通过空间层次的转变，丢弃了传统立面的单一和呆板。其节奏、比例、尺度更符合现代人的审美要求。

西班牙洋房一般都拥有花园和庭院（西班牙称作Patio），丰富了家庭的生活与交流空间。



\3. 海湾式布局

西班牙是海洋国家，所以"水"是西班牙风格的灵魂元素之一，一些西班牙项目通常在空间分割中使用水系、绿化带为分隔媒介，使社区与外部自然区分，由社区空间到生活空间，水岸气息散落每个角落，体现了建筑与水与人的完美和谐。

### 课文理解

Mike讲到自己把从裁缝那讨来的勋章都在晚宴上分发出去了（So I cut them all off their backing—you know, they put them on a strip—and gave them all around. Gave one to each girl）, 结果勋章是裁缝的一个顾主留在那儿的，Mike因为无力偿还而至今仍欠着裁缝人情。这中间还穿插了一个细节，也就是关于Mike破产的这件事——

💧**Clue 1**: Mike has gone bankrupt.



**Evidence 1**: Frightful blow to him when I went bankrupt. It was right after the medals. Gave his letters rather a bitter tone.

我的破产对他是个巨大的打击。这事紧接着在勋章事件之后。他的来信口气可沉痛哩。



**Evidence 2**: "Friends," said Mike. "I had a lot of friends. False friends. Then I had creditors, too. Probably had more creditors than anybody in England."

“朋友呗，”迈克说。“我有很多朋友。一帮酒肉朋友。后来我也就有了债主。或许比任何一个英国人的债主都多。”



Mike坦白了自己是如何破产的，首先是结识了一帮酒肉朋友，之后他自己也因为奢靡挥霍有了债主。这件事情Brett也知晓，在前面的内容里Brett介绍Mike的时候就说到了他是一个“undischarged bankrupt”（债务未偿清的破产人）。既然Mike还背负着债务，为什么Brett会跟Mike结婚呢？

这里还有一个作者并没有明确地挑明，我们可以从Jake第一次提到Mike时说的一句话里推测出来："She's in love with Mike Campbell, and she's going to marry him. He's going to be rich as hell some day."（Chapter 5）可以知道Mike留住Brett的手段是让她相信自己很快就会有钱。

但从读者的视角来看，我们知道Mike是一个不太靠谱的人，比如他经常喝得烂醉，讲话无礼粗鲁，所以实际情况是Mike并不能作出可靠的承诺。这也将导致他在Brett面前缺乏安全感，从而引发其他问题（接下来的内容里就会有冲突出现）。

今天的内容还有相当大的篇幅是描写这行人一起去斗牛场看“公牛出笼”（unloading）的。在这个过程中犍牛（steer）和公牛（bull）的动作形成了鲜明的对比——



💧**Clue 2**: The steers are in sharp contrast to the bulls.



**Evidence 1**: At the other end of the corral a gate opened and two steers came in, swaying their heads and trotting, their lean flanks swinging.

牛栏另一边的一扇门打开了，两头犍牛跑进场子，晃着脑袋，一路小跑着，瘦瘠的腹部两侧颤悠着。



**Evidence 2**: The steer was down now, his neck stretched out, his head twisted, he lay the way he had fallen. Suddenly the bull left off and made for the other steer which had been standing at the far end, his head swinging, watching it all.

犍牛这时已经倒下了，挺着脖子，扭着脑袋，它怎么倒下的就怎么躺着。突然，公牛撇下它，冲向另一头犍牛，这头犍牛远远地站在一边，晃着脑袋，观察着发生的一切。



犍牛因为十分温顺且没有攻击性，所以一般会用来安抚公牛的情绪，防止公牛之间发生打斗厮杀，由此犍牛也经常在这个过程为公牛所伤。对于这个稍显“血腥残忍”的场面Brett却欣赏得津津有味（"Don't look," I said to Brett. She was watching, fascinated）, 并且她对公牛也称赞有加（"My God, isn't he beautiful?" Brett said）, Jake自己也把公牛形容为一位技艺高超的拳击手（"Look how he knows how to use his horns," I said. "He's got a left and a right just like a boxer"）.

除了脾性上的不同，犍牛和公牛的根本不同点还在于前者是遭受了阉割的。我们会在后面的内容里看到作者描写这一段的真实意图，以及捕捉到其中的暗示。

"Tell them about your learned counsel," Brett said.（“告诉他们你还有过博学的辩护律师呢。”勃莱特说。）counsel 在日常生活里有“忠告，建议”的意思，在这里是指“律师，法律顾问”。

英文里对于律师的职称其实有很多，比如我们还见过lawyer, attorney等，但他们实际上并不是完全等同的哦~ 西方国家对律师的划分很细致，而且由于传统和习惯不同，各个称谓的含义也稍有不同：



\1. Attorney

代理人、法律事务代理人、律师

这个词是指接受当事人委托，并有资格在法庭上代理当事人出庭参与诉讼的律师。比lawyer更正规、更书面，与委托人（client）相对应。这个词较广泛的应用于美国，还有更正式的可以称为attorney-at-law或者counselor at law.



\2. Counsel (Counsellor)

提供法律意见，法律咨询的法律顾问

counsel经常和counsellor或counselor at law互用。当然，在某些国家，counsel也可以同Lawyer作为法律职业的总称互换使x用。

值得一提的是，counsel 与 advisor 指代的对象比较具体，偏重于指“法律顾问”，当然也可指出庭律师，但一般来讲，主要指为公司提供顾问或咨询性质服务的律师。比如house/in-house counsel是企业法律顾问，为企业的正式雇员。



\3. Advocate

辩护律师

在英语中既是动词也是名词。作为动词表示“提倡，鼓吹，拥护，为……辩护”，作名词则是“提倡者，支持者，（辩护）律师”。

当advocate表示“（辩护）律师”的时候，主要是指学习法律、依法获准执业、为当事人提供法律意见，并有资格出庭参加案件公开审理的律师（但在英美不常用）。在法国，advocate还可以作为“律师职业”的统称。



\4. Solicitor

沙律师（初级律师）

这个称呼主要用于英国和香港等地，Solicitor为初级律师，事务律师，香港常称为沙律师，主要处理非诉讼业务和一些在初级法院出庭的诉讼业务，起草法律文件，出具法律意见，提供法律咨询等。一般只能在基层法院代理当事人出庭发表意见，但是，如果事务律师满足一定的执业条件和年限，经过考核也可以申请在高级法院出庭。



\5. Barrister

巴律师（出庭律师）

Barrister主要和Solicitor相区别，它表示出庭律师，香港也称为巴律师，大律师，港台影视剧中常称为“大状”，他们准许在高级法院出庭辩护或者代理。Barrister执业超过10年且表现优异，可申请成为资深大律师，以前也称为御用大律师（Queen'sCounsel）. 出庭的时候Barrister需要戴假发，而Solicitor不戴假发。

出庭律师（Barrister）通常不能直接为当事人所聘请，如果需要，通常由当事人的事务律师（Solicitor）代表当事人聘请。出庭律师更注重口才和思辨能力，而事务律师更注重文书写作能力，两者的区别只是职业分工的不同，并不代表等级的不同。从事出庭律师，还是事务律师完全看个人的兴趣爱好和执业方向。

*Solicitor和Barrister的区别主要存在于英联邦国家，比如在美国就没有这样的分类（一般统称为我们一开始提到的attorney或attorney-at-law）.



\6. Bar

律师全称

Bar是律师职业的全称概念。bar一词本身没有律师的意思，只有加定冠词并大写时（the Bar）才有“律师界”的意思，这是因为在中世纪的欧洲，律师和法庭上旁听的观众之间会有一个木制的栏杆（wooden bar）分隔开。

（18世纪比利时的露天法庭）

由Bar还引申出了以下几个说法，比如：be called to the bar 表示“取得律师资格，成为律师”；read for the Bar 表示“成为法律系的学生，学习法律”。

*既然提到了在法庭上律师会被称作the Bar，大家可以猜一下the Bench是指谁呢？

We climbed down from the wall with the crowd, and had a last look at the bulls through the loopholes in the wall of the corral.

They were all quiet now, their headsdown.

We got a carriage outside and rode up to the café.

Mike and Bill came in half an hour later. They had stopped on the way for several drinks.

We were sitting in the café.

"That's an extraordinary business," Brett said.

"Will those last ones fight as well as the first?" Robert Cohn asked.

"They seemed to quiet down awfullyfast."

"They all know each other," I said. "They're only dangerous when they're alone, or only two or three of them together."

"What do you mean, dangerous?" Bill said. "They all looked dangerous to me."

"They only want to kill when they're alone. Of course, if you went in there you'd probably detach one of them from the herd, and he'd be dangerous."

> ==detach英 [dɪˈtætʃ] 美 [dɪˈtætʃ] vt. 派遣；分离，拆开==
>
> vt. 派遣（to send a group of soldiers, etc. away from the main group, especially to do special duties）

> 分离，拆开（to remove sth from sth larger; to become separated from sth）
>
> 原文："Of course, if you went in there you'd probably detach one of them from the herd, and he'd be dangerous."
>
> “当然啰，如果你到牛栏里去，也许会从牛群里引出一头公牛来，这时它就很凶。”
>
> 💧detach 的本义是“从整体（群体）当中分离出来”，也可以引申为“挣脱”，相当于seperate sth/oneself from, 比如： I tried to detachmyself from the reality of these terrible events.
>
> 我尽力使自己从这些可怕事件的现实中摆脱出来。

"That's too complicated," Bill said. "Don't you ever detach me from the herd, Mike."

"I say," Mike said, "they were fine bulls, weren't they? Did you see their horns?"

"Did I not," said Brett. "I had no idea what they were like."

"Did you see the one hit that steer?"Mike asked. "That was extraordinary."

"It's no life being a steer," Robert Cohn said.

"Don't you think so?" Mike said. "I would have thought you'd loved being a steer, Robert."

"What do you mean, Mike?"

"They lead such a quiet life. They never say anything and they're always hanging about so."

We were embarrassed. Bill laughed.Robert Cohn was angry. Mike went on talking.

"I should think you'd love it. You'd never have to say a word.

Come on, Robert. Do say something. Don't just sit there."

"I said something, Mike. Don't you remember? About the steers."

"Oh, say something more. Say something funny.

Can't you see we're all having a good time here?"

"Come off it, Michael. You're drunk,"Brett said.

"I'm not drunk. I'm quite serious. Is Robert Cohn going to follow Brett around like a steer all the time?"

"Shut up, Michael. Try and show a little breeding."

"Breeding be damned. Who has any breeding, anyway, except the bulls?

Aren't the bulls lovely? Don't you like them, Bill?

Why don't you say something, Robert? Don't sit there looking like a bloody funeral.

What if Brett did sleep with you? She's slept with lots of better people than you."

"Shut up," Cohn said. He stood up. "Shut up, Mike."

"Oh, don't stand up and act as though you were going to hit me.

That won't make any difference to me. Tell me, Robert.

Why do you follow Brett around like a poor bloody steer?

Don't you know you're not wanted? I know when I'm not wanted.

Why don't you know when you're not wanted?

You came down to San Sebastian where you weren't wanted, and followed Brett around like a bloody steer. Do you think that's right?"

"Shut up. You're drunk."

"Perhaps I am drunk. Why aren't you drunk?

Why don't you ever get drunk, Robert?

You know you didn't have a good time at San Sebastian because none of our friends would invite you on any of the parties.

You can't blame them hardly. Can you? I asked them to.

They wouldn't do it. You can't blame them, now. Can you?

Now, answer me. Can you blame them?"

"Go to hell, Mike."

"I can't blame them. Can you blame them?

Why do you follow Brett around? Haven't you any manners?

How do you think it makes me feel?"

"You're a splendid one to talk about manners," Brett said.

"You've such lovely manners." "Come on, Robert," Bill said.

"What do you follow her around for?"Bill stood up and took hold of Cohn.

"Don't go," Mike said. "Robert Cohn's going to buy a drink."

Bill went off with Cohn. Cohn's face was sallow. Mike went on talking.

I sat and listened for a while. Brett looked disgusted.

"I say, Michael, you might not be such a bloody ass," she interrupted.

"I'm not saying he's not right, you know." She turned to me.

The emotion left Mike's voice. We were all friends together.

"I'm not so damn drunk as I sounded," he said.

"I know you're not," Brett said.

"We're none of us sober," I said.

"I didn't say anything I didn't mean."

"But you put it so badly," Brett laughed.

"He was an ass, though. He came down to San Sebastian where he damn well wasn't wanted.

He hung around Brett and just looked at her. It made me damned well sick."

"He did behave very badly," Brett said.

"Mark you. Brett's had affairs with men before.

She tells me all about everything. She gave me this chap Cohn's letters to read. I wouldn't read them."

"Damned noble of you." "No, listen, Jake.

Brett's gone off with men. But they weren't ever Jews, and they didn't come and hang about afterward."

"Damned good chaps," Brett said.

"It's all rot to talk about it. Michael and I understand each other."

"She gave me Robert Cohn's letters. I wouldn't read them."

"You wouldn't read any letters, darling. You wouldn't read mine."

"I can't read letters," Mike said. "Funny, isn't it?"

"You can't read anything."

"No. You're wrong there. I read quite a bit. I read when I'm at home."

"You'll be writing next," Brett said. "Come on, Michael. Do buck up.

You've got to go through with this thing now. He's here. Don't spoil the fiesta."

"Yes," I said, "it would be nice for me to tell him."

"Look, Brett. Tell Jake what Robert calls you. That is perfect, you know." "Oh, no. I can't."

"Go on. We're all friends. Aren't we all friends, Jake?" "I can't tell him. It's too ridiculous."

"I'll tell him." "You won't, Michael. Don't be an ass."

"He'd be good, you know," Brett said. "He writes a good letter."

"I know," I said. "He wrote me from San Sebastian."

"That was nothing," Brett said. "He can write a damned amusing letter."

"She made me write that. She was supposed to be ill."

"I damned well was, too."

"Come on," I said, "we must go in and eat."

"How should I meet Cohn?" Mike said.

"Just act as though nothing had happened."

"It's quite all right with me," Mike said. "I'm not embarrassed."

"If he says anything, just say you were tight."

"Quite. And the funny thing is I think I was tight."

"Come on," Brett said. "Are these poisonous things paid for? I must bathe before dinner."

We walked across the square. It was dark and all around the square were the lights from the cafés under the arcades.

We walked across the gravel under the trees to the hotel.

They went up-stairs and I stopped to speak with Montoya.

"Well, how did you like the bulls?" he asked.

"Good. They were nice bulls."

"They're all right" — Montoya shook his head — "but they're not too good."

"What didn't you like about them?"

"I don't know. They just didn't give me the feeling that they were so good."

"I know what you mean." "They're all right."

"Yes. They're all right." "How did your friends like them?" "Fine."

"Good," Montoya said.I went up-stairs.

Bill was in his room standing on the balcony looking out at the square.

I stood beside him."Where's Cohn?" "Up-stairs in his room."

"How does he feel?" "Like hell, naturally. Mike was awful. He's terrible when he's tight."

"He wasn't so tight."

"The hell he wasn't. I know what we had before we came to the café."

"He sobered up afterward." "Good. He was terrible.

I don't like Cohn, God knows, and I think it was a silly trick for him to godown to San Sebastian, but nobody has any business to talk like Mike."

"Grand. It's grand the way they bring them out."

"To-morrow come the Miuras."

"When does the fiesta start?" "Day after to-morrow."

"We've got to keep Mike from getting so tight. That kind of stuff is terrible."

"We'd better get cleaned up for supper." "Yes. That will be a pleasant meal."

"Won't it?"As a matter of fact, supper was a pleasant meal.

Brett wore a black, sleeveless evening dress. She looked quite beautiful.

Mike acted as though nothing had happened.

I had to go up and bring Robert Cohn down.

He was reserved and formal, and his face was still taut and sallow, but he cheered up finally.

He could not stop looking at Brett. It seemed to make him happy.

It must have been pleasant for him to see her looking so lovely, and know he had been away with her and that every one knew it.

They could not take that away from him. Bill was very funny.

So was Michael. They were good together.

It was like certain dinners I remember from the war.

There was much wine, an ignored tension, and a feeling of things coming that you could not prevent happening.

Under the wine I lost the disgusted feeling and was happy.

It seemed they were all such nice people.

### 背景知识

**💧****CASA MILà 米拉之家**

昨天我们介绍了西班牙建筑的风格特点，今天我们来看一下西班牙闻名世界的一个非常特别的建筑——米拉之家（又称“石头屋”，The stone quarry）.

它是西班牙的一位天才建筑家高迪（Gaudí）设计的最后一个私人住宅，建于1906年至1912年间，坐落在西班牙的巴塞罗那市区里的Eixample扩建区、格拉西亚大道（Passeig de Gràcia）上。占地1,323平方米，有33个阳台，150扇窗户，3个采光中庭（2个大中庭，1个小天井），6 层住宅，1层顶楼(阁楼)，1个地下停车场，共有3个门面，两个正门入口。

当时的富豪米拉先生（Pere Milà）因为非常欣赏高迪为巴特由先生设计的巴特由之家（CASA BATLLó），所以便邀请高迪设计自己和妻子的婚房。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/7b4415376ce2ae631a4fb4465b063bc9-sz_972731.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)

（同样位于巴塞罗那的巴特由之家）



高迪最为擅长的是把曲线融入到建筑里，并且大胆地运用色彩。他自己这么说过：“直线属于人类，曲线属于上帝。”他最钟情的是抛物线和波浪线，因此也有人把高迪称作是上帝的建筑师。米拉之家的拱顶就采用了这样的设计↓

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/cf8b37de5b08721275f6f5bc8235e667-sz_200783.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



米拉之家的内部，每一户都能双面采光，光线由采光中庭和外面街道进来，房间的形状也几乎全是圆型设计，天花板、窗户、走廊、很少有方正的矩形。

这种不同寻常的结构也激发着人们的浮想联翩，比如有人觉得它像非洲原住民在陡峭的悬崖所建造类似洞穴的住所，有人觉得像海浪，有人觉得像退潮后的沙滩，有人觉得像蜂窝的组织，有人觉得像熔岩构成的波浪，有人觉得像蛇窟，有人觉得像沙丘，有人觉得像寄生虫巢穴等等。

当然因为高迪本身是天主教徒，所以米拉之家在设计上还容纳了宗教因素。比如它的外墙高处可以看到一个 M 字和一朵玫瑰浮雕，它们都代表了圣母玛利亚（Maria, Virgen del Rosario / Our Lady of the Rosary）, 同时也代表了米拉夫人的名字Roser. 还可以看到的是一行浮雕的字“Ave - Gratia - M - Plena - Dominus - Tecum”，代表“上帝拯救你，玛利亚，你充满恩典，上帝与你同在”。

但是房子在建成后，米拉先生并不满意，他的夫人也觉得建筑的怪异设计过于恐怖（比如屋顶是奇形怪状的突起物做成的烟囱和通风管道），甚至拒绝支付佣金。最后高迪还是在法庭上胜诉了。现在这里已经被列为世界遗产，向市民及游客开放，里面还设置有高迪艺术品的展厅。

### 课文理解

Mike在喝了酒之后终于按捺不住对着Cohn破口大骂，有意思的是，他还把Cohn形容为刚刚他们在斗牛场上看到的犍牛（steer）. 在他看来，Cohn恬不知耻地缠着Brett的样子就像犍牛面对公牛的时候——

💧**Clue 1**: Cohn is referred to as a steer.

**Evidence 1**: Why do you follow Brett around like a poor bloody steer? Don't you know you're not wanted? I know when I'm not wanted. Why don't you know when you're not wanted?

你为什么老跟着勃莱特转悠，活像一头可怜的犍牛？你难道不知道自己不受待见吗？人家要是不待见我，我会知道的。人家不待见你，你怎么就一点都察觉不出来呢？

**Evidence 2**: "Mark you. Brett's had affairs with men before. She tells me all about everything. She gave me this chap Cohn's letters to read. I wouldn't read them."

“你听着，勃莱特过去和一些男人有过这样那样的关系。她都告诉我了。她把科恩这家伙的信都拿给我看。我不看。”

Mike在Brett面前一直有不安全感（我们在昨天的分析里提到过，他靠的是向Brett把自己说得天花乱坠，让她相信自己很快会有钱，所以才把Brett留在了身边）。所以当Cohn不识相地总是纠缠着Brett的时候，Mike既嫉妒又紧张（Brett甚至还把Cohn写的信给他看了）。

这里还隐藏了一个讽刺，因为实际上Jake才是更应该被称作steer的人（steer是被阉割后的小公牛，这跟Jake的处境从根本上来说是一致的）。并且跟Brett有真实感情同时还纠缠不清的，应该是Jake而不是Cohn. 换言之，Jake才应该遭受这些连珠带炮似的讽刺挖苦。作者没有直接把这一层挑明，而是通过影射的方式，来营造一种微妙的氛围。

在被Bill劝下来后，Mike冷静下来。Jake便告诉他装作什么事都没发生，或者解释说自己刚刚是喝醉了。但事实是，Mike并不是在说胡话，这些都是他的心声。直到最后大家在晚餐上都表现得很得体，而Jake更感觉在酒精的作用下，似乎一切都呈现的美好可爱。这两处细节都提到了酒，而酒对于迷惘的一代来说，意义就在于对现实的麻醉和逃避——



💧**Clue 2**: Wine helps people escape from reality.

**Evidence 1**: "It's quite all right with me," Mike said. "I'm not embarrassed."

"If he says anything, just say you were tight."

"Quite. And the funny thing is I think I was tight."

“我倒没有什么，”迈克说，“我脸皮厚。”

“如果他提起，就说你喝醉了。”

“确实醉了。有趣的是，我现在才明白我刚才是醉了。”

**Evidence 2**: Under the wine I lost the disgusted feeling and was happy. It seemed they were all such nice people.

酒醉之余，烦恼烟消云散，我感觉到飘飘然。人们似乎都那么可亲可爱。

Mike不想承担造成这一尴尬局面的后果，于是假托自己喝醉了酒；而Jake在面对众人各自心怀鬼胎的平静之下，则试图通过酒精来回避可能到来的一个无法阻止的事件：There was much wine, an ignored tension, and a feeling of things coming that you could not prevent happening. （备有大量的酒，置紧张于不顾，预感事件降临而你又无法防止。）

这里也是一个明显的预示（foreshadowing）, 说明故事的冲突（conflict）很快会来临，给读者留下悬念。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****英语词源追溯——希腊神话人物**

Mike向大伙透露Cohn私下把Brett称作Circe（古希腊神话的女巫），讽刺他爱掉书袋。其实希腊文化作为西方文化的源头之一，对英语有着深长久远的影响。比如我们日常当中使用的很多词汇都是从古希腊神话当中的人物名称而来的：

\1. Chaos

Chaos是希腊神话中最原始的天神——混沌之神的名字。根据古希腊诗人赫西俄德《神谱》（公元前8世纪）描述：宇宙之初本一无所有，Chaos最先独自诞生，是一个无边无际、一无所有的空间。随Chaos之后又独自诞生了大地之神盖亚（Gaia）、地狱深渊神塔耳塔洛斯（Tartarus）和爱神厄洛斯（Eros），世界由此开始。

但是在罗马诗人奥维德《变形记》中被Chaos描述为“一团乱糟糟、没有秩序的物体”，chaos至此已经失去了神性，从“裂缝”的本意演变成了延续至今的“混沌”之意。

\2. Titan

Titan 是希腊神话中曾统治世界的古老的神族，这个家族是天穹之神乌拉诺斯和大地女神盖亚的子女，他们曾统治世界，但因为他们阉割了父亲乌拉诺斯，而受到乌拉诺斯的诅咒最终被宙斯为首的奥林匹斯神族推翻并取代。

相传泰坦族外貌和人类差不多，只是比较巨大壮硕。所以titan有了“巨大”的含义，它可以形容多大的物体呢？比如土卫六作为土星最大的一颗卫星就被命名为了Titan. 

此外titan还可以指“（某一行业的）巨头，泰斗”（giant）, 比如：the country's richest business titan（这个国家最富有的商业巨头）。而泰坦尼克号之所以叫作Titanic也是取其extremely large的含义。

\3. Panic

Pan 是希腊神话里的牧神，掌管牧羊，自然，山林乡野。他有着人一样的头和身躯，山羊的腿、角和耳朵。潘的外表后来被欧洲中世纪时期天主教妖魔化成为恶魔的原形。潘喜欢吹排箫，他吹的排箫具有催眠的力量。

Pan也是空寂场所恐惧的发起者，panic（惊恐）即来源于此。在Titan神对奥林匹斯山的叛乱和攻击中，他声称也有胜利的荣誉，因为他在叛乱者中引起了恐慌。此外在马拉松战役中（Marathon），据说Pan站在雅典人的一边，因此也在雅典人的敌人波斯人心中激起了恐慌。总之就是一个他到哪里就会在哪里引起恐慌的人物，所以只要是和他有关的（panic）就是令人害怕的~

\4. Atlas

Atlas是古希腊神话中的擎天巨神，属于泰坦神族。他被宙斯降罪来用双肩支撑苍天。传说中，北非国王是Atlas的后人。北非阿特拉斯山脉（Atlas Mountains）正是以他来命名。亚特拉斯航空（Atlas Air）飞机的垂直尾翼也绘有擎天神双肩支撑苍天的图样。

那么Atlas是怎么进入英语中并表示“地图册”这个含义的呢？这要追溯到16世纪佛兰德地理学家麦卡托（Mercator）出版的第一本世界地图册，这本册子的扉页就印有Atlas以双肩扛天的图片，于是得名Atlas. 后人也争相模仿，从此atlas就有了“地图集”的含义。

\5. Ceres

Ceres是罗马神话中的农业和丰收女神，罗马十二主神之一。她是Jupiter的姐姐，也是西方是最受欢迎的神祗之一。她教会人类耕种，给予大地生机。她具有无边的法力，可以使土地肥沃、植物茂盛、五谷丰登，也可以令大地枯萎、万物凋零、寸草不生。可以让人拥有享之不尽的财富，同时也可以让人家徒四壁、一贫如洗。

我们现在看到的cereal从拉丁语而来，意思就是of Ceres（属于农业、丰收女神的），因此cereal也就有了“谷物”的含义（或者指西方人早餐喜欢和牛奶一起吃的那种麦片）。

I do not know what time I got to bed.

I remember undressing, putting on a bathrobe, and standing out on the balcony.

I knew I was quite drunk, and when I came in I put on the light over the head of the bed and started to read.

I was reading a book by Turgenieff. Probably I read the same two pages over several times.

It was one of the stories in "A Sportsman's Sketches."

> Turgenieff（屠格涅夫）是19世纪俄国批判现实主义作家。这里提到的"A Sportsman's Sketches"（《猎人笔记》）是他的成名之作，这本随笔集通过猎人的狩猎活动，记述了19世纪中叶俄罗斯农村生活。这种见闻录的形式在当时很新颖独特，并且语言简练优美，可谓散文化小说、诗化小说的范例。

I had read it before, but it seemed quite new.

The country became very clear and the feeling of pressure in my head seemed to loosen.

I was very drunk and I did not want to shut my eyes because the room would go round and round.

If I kept on reading that feeling would pass.

I heard Brett and Robert Cohn come up the stairs.

Cohn said good night outside the door and went on up to his room.

I heard Brett go into the room next door. Mike was already in bed.

He had come in with me an hour before. He woke as she came in, and they talked together.

I heard them laugh. I turned off the light and tried to go to sleep.

It was not necessary to read any more.

I could shut my eyes without getting the wheeling sensation. But I could not sleep.

There is no reason why because it is dark you should look at things differently from when it is light. The hell there isn't!

I figured that all out once, and for six months I never slept with the electric light off.

That was another bright idea.

To hell with women, anyway.

To hell with you, Brett Ashley.

Women made such swell friends. Awfully swell.

In the first place, you had to be in love with a woman to have a basis of friendship.

I had been having Brett for a friend. I had not been thinking about her side of it.

I had been getting something for nothing.

That only delayed the presentation of the bill.

The bill always came. That was one of the swell things you could count on.

I thought I had paid for everything.

Not like the woman pays and pays and pays.

Just exchange of values. You gave up something and got something else.

Or you worked for something.

You paid some way for everything that was any good.

I paid my way into enough things that I liked, so that I had a good time.

Either you paid by learning about them, or by experience, or by taking chances, or by money.

Enjoying living was learning to get your money's worth and knowing when you had it.

You could get your money's worth.

The world was a good place to buy in.

It seemed like a fine philosophy.

In five years, I thought, it will seem just as silly as all the other fine philosophies I've had.

Perhaps that wasn't true, though.

Perhaps as you went along you did learn something.

I did not care what it was all about. All I wanted to know was how to live in it.

Maybe if you found out how to live in it you learned from that what it was all about.

I wished Mike would not behave so terribly to Cohn, though.

Mike was a bad drunk. Brett was a good drunk.

Bill was a good drunk. Cohn was never drunk.

Mike was unpleasant after he passed a certain point.

I liked to see him hurt Cohn.

I wished he would not do it, though, because afterward it made me disgusted at myself.

That was morality; things that made you disgusted afterward.

No, that must be immorality.

That was a large statement. What a lot of bilge I could think up at night.

What rot, I could hear Brett say it.

What rot! When you were with the English you got into the habit of using English expressions in your thinking.

The English spoken language — the upper classes, anyway — must have fewer words than the Eskimo.

Of course I didn't know anything about the Eskimo.

Maybe the Eskimo was a fine language. Say the Cherokee.

I didn't know anything about the Cherokee, either.

The English talked with inflected phrases.

One phrase to mean everything.

I liked them, though.I liked the way they talked.

Take Harris. Still Harris was not the upper classes.

I turned on the light again and read.I read the Turgenieff.

I knew that now, reading it in the oversensitized state of my mind after much too much brandy,

I would remember it somewhere, and afterward it would seem as though it had really happened to me.

I would always have it. That was another good thing you paid for and then had.

Some time along toward daylight I went to sleep.

The next two days in Pamplona were quiet, and there were no more rows.

The town was getting ready for the fiesta.

Workmen put up the gate-posts that were to shut off the side streets when the bulls were released from the corrals and came running through the streets in the morning on their way to the ring.

The workmen dug holes and fitted in the timbers, each timber numbered for its regular place.

Out on the plateau beyond the town employees of the bull-ring exercised picador horses, galloping them stiff-legged on the hard, sun-baked fields behind the bull-ring.

The big gate of the bull-ring was open, and inside the amphitheatre was being swept.

The ring was rolled and sprinkled, and carpenters replaced weakened or cracked planks in the barrera.

Standing at the edge of the smooth rolled sand you could look up in the empty stands and see old women sweeping out the boxes.

Outside, the fence that led from the last Street of the town to the entrance of the bull-ring was already in place and made a long pen;

the crowd would come running down with the bulls behind them on the morning of the day of the first bull-fight.

Out across the plain, where the horse and cattle fair would be, some gypsies had camped under the trees.

The wine and aguardiente (土酿白兰地) sellers were putting up their booths.

One booth advertised ANIS DEL TORO ([西]公牛茴香酒).

The cloth sign hung against the planks in the hot sun. In the big square that was the centre of the town there was no change yet.

We sat in the white wicker chairs on the terrasse of the café and watched the motorbuses come in and unload peasants from the country coming in to the market,

and we watched the buses fill up and start out with peasants sitting with their saddle-bags full of the things they had bought in the town.

> ==wicker英 [ˈwɪkə(r)] 美 [ˈwɪkɚ] n. 柳条（编制品）；（编制筐篓的）枝条==

> paseo 来源于西班牙语，意思就是“散步”。这里特别提到也是因为对于西班牙人来说“散步”已经成为了一种重要的生活方式：只要到了晚上，家家户户都会走到大街上或在社区里闲逛。这时候路边还经常会有各种小摊小贩，十分热闹欢腾，和我们的“赶夜市”很像。

all the fashionable people of the town, walked in the street on one side of the square while the café tables filled with the regular after-dinner crowd.

During the morning I usually sat in the café and read the Madrid papers and then walked in the town or out into the country.

Sometimes Bill went along. Sometimes he wrote in his room.

Robert Cohn spent the mornings studying Spanish or trying to get a shave at the barber-shop.

Brett and Mike never got up until noon. We all had a vermouth at the café.

It was a quiet life and no one was drunk.

I went to church a couple of times, once with Brett.

She said she wanted to hear me goto confession, but I told her that not only was it impossible but it was not as interesting as it sounded, and, besides, it would be in a language she did not know.

We met Cohn as we came out of church, and although it was obvious he had followed us,

yet he was very pleasant and nice, and we all three went for a walk out to the gypsy camp, and Brett had her fortune told.

It was a good morning, there were high white clouds above the mountains.

It had rained a little in the night and it was fresh and cool on the plateau, and there was a wonderful view.

We all felt good and we felt healthy,and I felt quite friendly to Cohn.

You could not be upset about anything on a day like that.

That was the last day before the fiesta.

### 背景知识

**💧****The Gypsies (The Romani People) 吉卜赛人**

...and we all three went for a walk out to the gypsy camp, and Brett had her fortune told.（我们三人一直溜达到吉普赛人的帐篷那里，勃莱特叫人算了命。）

吉卜赛作为一个以“四处流浪”为特点的民族，拥有着很多浪漫和神秘的特质。他们自称为罗姆人（Romani），在吉卜赛人语中，“罗姆”的原意是“人”。但英国人称其为吉卜赛人，法国人称其为波希米亚人，西班牙人又称其为弗拉明戈人。

关于吉卜赛人的祖先，根据最新的考证，他们可能祖居今伊朗境内，大约公元10世纪以后，迫于战乱和饥荒，茨冈人开始离开印度向外迁徙，他们没有固定的居所，而是以大篷车为家和交通工具，以卖艺为生，在一个个城市间游荡，逐渐成为世界闻名的流浪民族。

吉卜赛人的语言及文化，在欧洲已经超过五百年历史。尽管如此，在法国的布列塔尼省，吉卜赛人仍然被视为化外之民，随时可能被警察拘留。而相关风俗及耕地的法令，也对他们产生了越来越不利的限制。

欧洲人总希望吉卜赛人继续在营火边弹着吉他歌舞，同时却又希望他们定居下来，有正常的职业、定期缴所得税，把小孩子送进学校受教育等。然而，吉卜赛人却不这么想，他们要继续活得像个吉卜赛人——到处流浪。

吉卜赛民族也一直以能歌善舞著称，他们的音乐就和整个民族的分布一样，遍布于世界的许多国家。比如提起吉普赛的音乐作品，人们总会联想到匈牙利、西班牙、罗马尼亚、法国等，其中以匈牙利的吉普赛音乐风格最具代表性。

并且吉普赛音乐独特的魅力也受到作曲家的青睐，如李斯特的《匈牙利狂想曲》、萨拉萨蒂的《流浪者之歌》、拉威尔的《茨冈》等都是富有吉普赛音乐特色的作品。

因为长期居无定所以流浪为生，所以吉卜赛民族并不像其他民族那样事农桑或是豢养家畜。吉卜赛男人一般以贩卖家畜、驯兽、补锅（黑白铁匠）和充当乐师为业，妇女则从事卜筮、卖药、行乞和表演等行业。比如这里Brett就在一个吉卜赛人那里进行了占卜。

在传统印象中吉卜赛人都是拿着水晶球来算命的，但现在已经非常少见了。大多数算命者是用特殊的吉卜赛算命扑克牌来给人占卜。也有说塔罗牌就是从吉卜赛民族而来的。

### 课文理解

Jake在睡前的这段心理活动描写采用的也就是我们前面提到的“意识流”（stream of consciousness）手法，并且是在Jake喝得大醉之后发生的（I knew I was quite drunk）, 虽然他自己也觉得这些都是胡话连篇（What a lot of bilge I could think up at night）, 但里面还是可以抓到两条关键的线索来把握Jake心理状态。首先是他一直处于无法面对自己真实想法的痛苦之中（尤其到了晚上）——

💧**Clue 1**: Jake is in agony of facing his true thoughts.

**Evidence 1**: There is no reason why because it is dark you should look at things differently from when it is light. The hell there isn't!

没道理因为熄了灯，看什么东西就要和亮着灯的时候不同。见鬼去吧，一点道理都没有！

**Evidence 2**: I figured that all out once, and for six months I never slept with the electric light off. That was another bright idea. To hell with women, anyway. To hell with you, Brett Ashley.

有一次我把这事好好思量了一番，于是整整六个月，我睡觉一定得开着灯。这又是一个绝妙的点子。女人都见鬼去吧。还有你，勃莱特·阿什利，也见鬼去吧。

为什么晚上开灯或熄灯对Jake来说这么纠结难受呢？不知道大家是否还记得Jake在早先这么说过：It is awfully easy to be hard-boiled about everything in the daytime, but at night it is another thing.（Chapter 4.2）

在白天他可以对一切都若无其事，但是一到晚上情况就迥然不同（“事物的样子在白天和晚上不同”只是一个象征，实际暗示的是Jake一到晚上就没法再维持伪装而必须要面对自己真实的想法）。最后的这两句其实就说明了困扰他的究竟什么——女人，尤其是Brett.

对于这种困扰，Jake首先采取的办法是用一种“等价交换”的视角来看人与人之间的关系：

💧**Clue 2**: Jake adopts the philosophy of the exchange of values when regarding relationships.

**Evidence 1**: Just exchange of values. You gave up something and got something else. Or you worked for something. You paid some way for everything that was any good.

以为不过是等价交换罢了，你放弃点什么就能得到点别的什么。或者你为了得到什么而努力工作。为了得到任何有点好处的东西你都得以某种方式付出点代价。

**Evidence 2**: It seemed like a fine philosophy. In five years, I thought, it will seem just as silly as all the other fine philosophies I've had.

可是我想，再过五年，它也就跟我曾经秉持过的其他高明的人生哲学一样，显得奇傻无比了吧。

Jake的想法在这里发生了一个很有意思的转变：他一开始觉得能得到Brett的青睐从而和她变得亲密是自己占了便宜，所以他现在受的痛苦就是理所应当该还的债（I had been getting something for nothing. That only delayed the presentation of the bill. The bill always came）. 但他接着又说到“我已经把该还的账单都偿清了，是女人们一直在亏欠然后还也还不清”（I thought I had paid for everything. Not like the woman pays and pays and pays）, 转而把责任推到了Brett身上。

这种“等价交换”原则在物质生活中固然是合理可行的，但是Jake在面对他和Brett的感情关系时却显然纠结不清，他希望为自己现在遭受的折磨找到合理的依托（“我自己欠的债”或者“是Brett的错”），但最后也开始怀疑起这种人生哲学了。这也是当时战后青年们矛盾和迷惘的一个缩影——找不到恰当的价值观来消解精神上的痛苦。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****为什么形容英国人都有stiff upper lip?** 

Jake提到了自己很欣赏英国上层阶级说话的那种方式，比如他跟Brett接触多了就也有点染上英国人的习惯（Brett也算是英国的上层阶级，别忘了她有“Lady”这个头衔哦~ 因为她的丈夫是爵士身份，作为爵士的妻子她也可以享有贵族头衔）。

除了这里说到的英国上层阶级说话非常“简洁”（must have fewer words than the Eskimo）, 其实一直以来还有一个很生动的短语来形容他们在情绪表达上的克制——stiff upper lip, 这几乎已经成为英国人的一种典型特质了（a typical attribute of English people）.

stiff upper lip 字面上的意思就是“僵硬的上唇”，一般认为当人紧张不快的时候，上唇会不由自主地颤抖，所以上唇僵硬不动就表示这个人在克制自己的情绪。

所以keep/have a stiff upper lip一般用来指一个人不会轻易表达自己的内心情感，尤其在面对困难或伤心难过时，更加会压抑不安的情绪（remaining resolute and unemotional when faced with adversity）. 比如：

Although she was deeply saddened by the death of her son, she had a stiff upper lip at the funeral.

虽然她因丧子而悲痛万分，但是她在葬礼上（绷紧上唇）尽量不露哀伤。

Boys are taught to keep a stiff upper lip even during times of adversity.

男孩自幼被教导在困难时候仍然要（绷紧上唇）处变不惊。

英国人的这套冷静克制也跟他们的传统教育有关。英国过去的公立学校教育很严肃，不鼓励公开表达自己的感情，更加不鼓励男士在人面前表现出恐慌或悲痛等负面情绪，所以英国人往往给人很保守内敛的感觉。

其实如果再深究 ，这种对于自律的追求（cult of discipline）还可以追溯到古希腊的斯巴达克民族（the Spartans in Ancient Greece）, 进而到斯多葛学派（the Stoics）——古希腊的四大哲学学派之一，强调禁欲主义。后来古罗马人也吸纳了这一思想，比如罗马大帝马可·奥勒留（the Emperor Marcus Aurelius）就说过这么一句话：

"If you are distressed by any external thing, it is not this thing which disturbs you, but your own judgment about it. And it is in your power to wipe out that judgment now."

“如果外部的事物令你沮丧，那么真正起作用的并不是那些事物，而是你自己的判断。而消除这种判断，需要靠你自己的力量。”

当然现在keep a stiff upper lip也可以用来表示积极意义上的“保持情绪稳定、不轻易激动”，比如用来鼓励人在困难时镇静面对：

During the crisis, he managed to keep a stiff upper lip and focused all his attention on finding a solution.

在危机中，他没有显现出慌张，专心一致找寻解决方案。

Keep a stiff upper lip no matter what happens.

不管发生什么事，都要抑制情绪，保持冷静。

At noon of Sunday, the 6th of July, the fiesta exploded.

There is no other way to describe it.

People had been coming in all day from the country, but they were assimilated in the town and you did not notice them.

The square was as quiet in the hot sun as on any other day.

The peasants were in the outlying wine-shops.

> ==outlying英 [ˈaʊtlaɪɪŋ] 美 [ˈaʊtˌlaɪɪŋ] adj. 偏僻的，边远的；无关的；题外==

There they were drinking, getting ready for the fiesta.

They had come in so recently from the plains and the hills that it was necessary that they make their shifting in values gradually.

They could not start in paying café prices.

They got their money's worth in the wine-shops.

> <font color=red>They could not start in paying café prices. They got their money's worth in the wine-shops.</font>

> Bushel 蒲式耳（缩写BU）是一个计量单位。它是一种定量容器,好像我国旧时的斗、升等计量容器。它的单位重量在磅和吨之间，1蒲式耳在英国等于8加仑（gallons），等于4配克（pecks）（英国容积计量单位），相当于36.3688升（litres）。在美国，1蒲式耳相当于35.238升。

Late in the fiesta it would not matter what they paid, nor where they bought.

Now on the day of the starting of the fiesta of San Fermin they had been in the wine-shops of the narrow streets of the town since early morning.

Going down the streets in the morning on the way to mass in the cathedral, I heard them singing through the open doors of the shops.

They were warming up. There were many people at the eleven o'clock mass.

San Fermin is also a religious festival.

I walked down the hill from the cathedral and up the street to the café on the square.

It was a little before noon. Robert Cohn and Bill were sitting at one of the tables.

The marble-topped tables and the white wicker chairs were gone.

They were replaced by cast-iron tables and severe folding chairs.

The café was like a battleship stripped for action.

Today the waiters did not leave you alone all morning to read without asking if you wanted to order something.

A waiter came up as soon as I sat down.

"What are you drinking?" I asked Bill and Robert.

"Sherry," Cohn said.

"Jerez ([西]雪利酒)," I said to the waiter.

Before the waiter brought the sherry the rocket that announced the fiesta went up in the square.

It burst and there was a gray ball of smoke high up above the Theatre Gayarre, across on the other side of the plaza.

The ball of smoke hung in the sky like a shrapnel burst, and as I watched, another rocket came up to it, trickling smoke in the bright sunlight.

I saw the bright flash as it burst and another little cloud of smoke appeared.

By the time the second rocket had burst there were so many people in the arcade, that had been empty a minute before, that the waiter, holding the bottle high up over his head, could hardly get through the crowd to our table.

People were coming into the square from all sides, and down the street we heard the pipes and the fifes and the drums coming.

They were playing the riau-riau music, the pipes shrill and the drums pounding, and behind them came the men and boys dancing.

When the fifers stopped they all crouched down in the street, and when the reedpipes and the fifes shrilled, and the flat, dry, hollow drums tapped it out again, they all went up in the air dancing.

> ==crouch英 [kraʊtʃ] 美 [kraʊtʃ] vi. 蜷伏；屈膝，蹲伏；卑躬屈膝 vt. 低头，屈膝==

In the crowd you saw only the heads and shoulders of the dancers going up and down.

In the square a man, bent over, was playing on a reed-pipe, and a crowd of children were following him shouting, and pulling at his clothes.

He came out of the square, the children following him, and piped them past the café and down a side street.

We saw his blank pockmarked face as he went by, piping, the children close behind him shouting and pulling at him.

> ==pockmarked英 ['pɒkmɑ:kt] 美 ['pɒkmɑ:kt] adj. 麻；有痘疮的==

"He must be the village idiot," Bill said. "My God! look at that!"

Down the street came dancers. The street was solid with dancers, all men.

They were all dancing in time behind their own fifers and drummers.

They were a club of some sort, and all wore workmen's blue smocks, and red handkerchiefs around their necks, and carried a great banner on two poles.

The banner danced up and down with them as they came down surrounded by the crowd.

"Hurray for Wine! Hurray for the Foreigners!" was painted on the banner.

"Where are the foreigners?" Robert Cohn asked.

"We're the foreigners," Bill said.

All the time rockets were going up. The café tables were all full now.

The square was emptying of people and the crowd was filling the cafés.

"Where's Brett and Mike?" Bill asked.

"I'll go and get them," Cohn said.

"Bring them here."

The fiesta was really started. It kept up day and night for seven days.

The dancing kept up, the drinking kept up, the noise went on.

The things that happened could only have happened during a fiesta.

Everything became quite unreal finally and it seemed as though nothing could have any consequences.

It seemed out of place to think of consequences during the fiesta.

All during the fiesta you had the feeling, even when it was quiet, that you had to shout any remark to make it heard.

It was the same feeling about any action. It was a fiesta and it went on for seven days.

That afternoon was the big religious procession.

San Fermin was translated from onechurch to another.

In the procession were all the dignitaries, civil and religious.

>

We could not see them because the crowd was too great.

Ahead of the formal procession and behind it danced the riau-riau dancers.

There was one mass of yellow shirts dancing up and down in the crowd.

All we could see of the procession through the closely pressed people that crowded all the side streets and curbs were the great giants, cigar-store Indians,

thirty feet high, Moors, a King and Queen, whirling and waltzing solemnly to the riau-riau.

They were all standing outside the chapel where San Fermin and the dignitaries had passed in, leaving a guard of soldiers, the giants, with the men who danced in them standing beside their resting frames,and the dwarfs moving with their whacking bladders through the crowd.

> ==whacking英 [ˈwækɪŋ] 美 [ˈhwækɪŋ, ˈwæk-] adj. <英，口>（用于强调）巨大的==

We started inside and there was a smell of incense and people filing back into the church, but Brett was stopped just inside the door because she had no hat, so we went out again and along the street that ran back from the chapel into town.

The street was lined on both sides with people keeping their place at the curb for the return of the procession.

Some dancers formed a circle around Brett and started to dance.

They wore big wreaths of white garlics around their necks.

They took Bill and me by the arms and put us in the circle.

Bill started to dance, too.

They were all chanting. Brett wanted to dance but they did not want her to.

> ==chant英 [tʃɑ:nt] 美 [tʃænt] vt. 吟颂，咏唱；反复有节奏地喊叫（或唱等）==

They wanted her as an image to dance around.

>
> 在Jake看来，这些天主教徒们围着Brett跳舞无异于把她当成一尊偶像来崇拜，并且Brett本身还是一个异教徒（在天主教的信仰中，不信耶和华的都算作异教徒——pagan）.

When the song ended with the sharp riau-riau! they rushed us into a wine-shop.

We stood at the counter.They had Brett seated on a wine-cask.

It was dark in the wine-shop and full of men singing, hard-voiced singing.

Back of the counter they drew the wine from casks.

I put down money for the wine, but one of the men picked it up and put it back in my pocket.

"I want a leather wine-bottle," Bill said.

"There's a place down the street," I said. "I'll go get a couple."

The dancers did not want me to go out.

Three of them were sitting on the high wine-cask beside Brett, teaching her to drink out of the wine-skins.

They had hung a wreath of garlics around her neck.

Some one insisted on giving her a glass. Somebody was teaching Bill a song.

Singing it into his ear. Beating time on Bill's back.

I explained to them that I would be back.

Outside in the street I went down the street looking for the shop that made leather winebottles.

The crowd was packed on the sidewalks and many of the shops were shuttered, and I could not find it.

I walked as far as the church, looking on both sides of the street.

Then I asked a man and he took me by the arm and led me to it. The shutters were up but the door was open.

### 背景知识

**💧****1. Mass （天主教）弥撒**

There were many people at the eleven o'clock mass.（十一点钟的弥撒有很多人。）

Going down the streets in the morning on the way to mass in the cathedral, I heard them singing through the open doors of the shops.（上午，我穿过几条街道到大教堂去看弥撒，一路上我都听见从敞开着门的酒馆里传出他们的歌声。）

mass 指“弥撒”，是天主教的宗教仪式 。mass原来在拉丁语里的意思是“聚会，聚集”。古代教会举行感恩祭，礼仪结束时，都要向参礼者说：“Ite，Missa，est!”（"Go; the dismissal is made"）意思是：“去吧，弥撒礼成（此即聚集）!”这样久而久之，“弥撒”便成了感恩祭的代用名称。

*在新教（The Protestant Church）里一般不用“弥撒”这个词，而是说“礼拜”（worship service）.

（最早的弥撒）

弥撒的传统来源于《圣经·新约》里“最后的晚餐”（The Last Supper）. 根据福音书记载，耶稣在受难前夕的晚餐中，分别拿起麦面饼和葡萄酒，并称饼为自己的身体（bread the sacrificial body），而酒就是自己的血（wine the sacrificial blood），然后依次分给十二个门徒（apostles）. 并且命令门徒之后都要这么做，来纪念他的牺牲。在晚餐后，耶稣即被罗马士兵逮捕并送上十字架。

弥撒每周日在教堂进行，遇上特别的节日比如复活节、圣诞节，仪式会更加隆重。重要的环节有：进堂仪式（introductory rite）、神父讲道（sermon）、圣餐仪式（Eucharist）（以一小块饼和一小口红葡萄酒作为耶稣基督的身体和血，吃了以后就和耶稣同在，获得救赎）、礼成式（concluding rite）.

（圣杯和圣饼）



**💧****2. Riau-riau（圣福明节传统）**

They were playing the riau-riau music, the pipes shrill and the drums pounding, and behind them came the men and boys dancing.（他们在吹奏riau-riau舞曲，笛声尖细，鼓声咚咚，大人小孩跟在他们后边边走边舞。）

riau-riau 是属于圣福明节的一种重要庆祝形式。按照传统，在圣福明节第一天（即7月6日）下午4点半，每个人都要到大街上参加游行庆祝（procession）, 一路载歌载舞（乐队主要由横笛fife、风笛reed-pipe以及鼓drum组成）。

从1914年开始，riau-riau开始变成了一项官方的仪式（an official event）, 也就是市政当局的官员（city hall councilors）在这一天需要全副盛装出席，从市政厅一直步行到教堂（大约500米），一路上还会有很多民众夹道欢送。

比如今天的内容也提及了这个场景：That afternoon was the big religious procession. San Fermin was translated from one church to another. In the procession were all the dignitaries, civil and religious. We could not see them because the crowd was too great.

后来由于受到反当局的动乱分子的干扰和阻挠，这项传统从1991年开始被搁置。直到1997年再次恢复，但已经不再是官方日程上的活动了。

### 课文理解

狂欢节的第一天上午，首先迎来的是天主教教堂中的弥撒（There were many people at the eleven o'clock mass. San Fermin is also a religious festival）, 接着一颗焰火弹升空宣布狂欢节正式开始（the rocket that announced the fiesta went up in the square）. 人们都涌上街道参加游行，伴随着音乐和舞蹈（They were playing the riau-riau music, the pipes shrill and the drums pounding, and behind them came the men and boys dancing）.

根据Jake的描述，狂欢节就这样歌舞喧哗不停地持续了七天。并且他还提到了，所有这些发生的只有在狂欢节上发生（The things that happened could only have happened during a fiesta）, 当人们身在其中的时候，对事物的判断和价值观等都跟平时不太一样——



💧**Clue 1**: The fiesta changes people's values.



**Evidence 1**: Money still had a definite value in hours worked and bushels of grain sold. Late in the fiesta it would not matter what they paid, nor where they bought.

金钱对于他们来说仍然意味着劳作了多长时间和售出了多少蒲式耳粮食。以后等到狂欢节高潮的时候，他们就不在乎花多少钱，或者花在什么地方了。

Jake提及的 一个例子是从乡下来的农民们：他们最开始只愿意到酒馆里去消费，因为他们依然是以自己的劳动时间和卖出去的粮食来衡量金钱的价值。但沉浸在狂欢节之后，他们的这个观念就会被改变（他们也会开始觉得上咖啡馆是可以接受的）。

这种消费理念和昨天的内容中提到的“等价交换”是相冲突的（You could get your money's worth）, 因为在这里的情况中，付出和得到并不等值。同时也印证了Jake本身对这套人生哲学的怀疑（In five years, I thought, it will seem just as silly as all the other fine philosophies I've had）.

另一点值得注意的是，Jake在对狂欢节的描述中，还涉及到了很多和战争相关的用语，这也从侧面反映了战场上的经历始终在他的潜意识里徘徊——



💧**Clue 2**: The war memory still haunts Jake.



**Evidence 1**: They were replaced by cast-iron tables and severe folding chairs. The café was like a battleship stripped for action.

铸铁桌子和简陋的折叠椅被换了上来。咖啡馆活像是一艘轻装简行马上要上阵的军舰。



**Evidence 2**: The ball of smoke hung in the sky like a shrapnel burst...

这团悬在空中的烟雾像枚炸开的榴霰弹……



从其他细节处也可以看到Jake有意无意地把狂欢节和战争联系在一起，比如狂欢节的高涨和持久（It kept up day and night for seven days. The dancing kept up, the drinking kept up, the noise went on）, 以及狂欢节的虚幻和放纵（The things that happened could only have happened during a fiesta. Everything became quite unreal finally and it seemed as though nothing could have any consequences）.

大家可以再回到原文仔细品味这一段话，它几乎也能完美地用来形容战争的性质——激烈、持久、高昂、不计代价和后果。这在一定程度上也解释了Jake为什么深为狂欢节着迷并且每年都前来参加。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****最经典的交谊舞**

在今天的游行当中，令人瞩目的还有几尊足有三十英尺高的巨像，他们随着舞曲旋转着，就像在跳华尔兹一样（the great giants, cigar-store Indians, thirty feet high, Moors, a King and Queen, whirling and waltzing solemnly to the riau-riau）.

这里提到的华尔兹可以算是最经典并且历史最久的交谊舞（ballroom dance）了，我们之前介绍过的交谊舞还有狐步舞（Fox-trot）, 当然这已经是在华尔兹之后才出现的了。今天再给大家讲一讲几个经典交谊舞的诞生以及流行的过程~



\1. Waltz 华尔兹

华尔兹又叫“圆舞”，既可以双人也非常适合在舞厅（ballroom）里自娱。华尔兹起源于1780年，Waltz这个名称最初来自于德文，意思是“滚动”“旋转”或“滑动”。但是在这之前，以三拍子“蓬嚓嚓”为节奏的圆舞很早之前就流行于欧洲，特别是在德国巴伐利亚和奥地利维也纳一带的农民中。我们平时说的“快三”、“慢三”也就是在指华尔兹的两种速度。

在华尔兹之前，城镇里的居民一般兴跳传统的民族舞曲，比如小步舞和加伏特舞等。但它们太过刻板和拘谨，不能适应18世纪后人们对艺术趣味的新要求，而华尔兹则更加轻松自然、飘逸洒脱。但这也为华尔兹在一开始出现的时候招来了不少谩骂，尤其是在比较保守的英国，有人认为这种自由奔放是违背道德的甚至不文明的。

1834年后，华尔兹传到了美国。它在美国的第一个落脚点是波士顿，随即传到了纽约和费城。到19世纪中叶的时候，华尔兹已经风靡席卷了美国的社交圈。



\2. Tango 探戈

探戈是一种双人舞蹈，起源于非洲中西部的民间舞蹈探戈诺舞，探戈是摩登舞中较为特殊的舞蹈，也是摩登舞中唯一一个带有拉丁特色的舞蹈。16世纪末到17世纪初，随着黑奴贩卖进入美洲，融合了拉美民间舞蹈风格，形成了舞姿优雅洒脱的墨西哥探戈和舞姿挺拔、舞步豪放健美的阿根廷探戈随后传入欧洲，并不断融合发展至今。

探戈据说是情人之间的秘密舞蹈，男士原来跳舞时都佩带短刀。后来即便不佩带短刀，舞蹈者也必须表情严肃，表现出东张西望，提防被人发现的表情。

探戈舞步最显著的特点是“蟹行猫步”。当舞步需要前进时，舞者却作横行移动；当舞步需要后退时，舞者却作横向向前斜移。同时，探戈舞者的舞步常常随音乐节拍的变化而时快时慢，探戈也因此被称为“瞬间停顿的舞蹈”。



\3. Quickstep 快步

快步也称“快狐步”。在1923年左右起源于美国。采用的是比较快的4/4拍子音乐，还有着自己独特的舞步。快步舞和狐步舞都来源于狐步舞，只是因为一快一慢而演变成了不同的舞种。

快步的基本舞步是并合步（Chasse）、波格（Polka）、锁步（Lock）和一些华尔兹舞步。快步动作快速、机灵、起伏、弹跳敏捷，舞姿活跃动人，风格高贵优雅。



\4. Blues 布鲁斯 

我们一般说的“慢四”其实就是布鲁斯舞。布鲁斯是英文Blues的音译。布鲁斯舞曲来源于美洲丛林中黑色人种的有忧伤感的乐曲Blues，20世纪初流行于欧洲，传入英国以后，被改变成慢速稳健的舞厅舞。

布鲁斯舞步很简练，但举步庄重，保留着宫廷色彩和古典风韵。它的节奏与动作变化不大，进退平稳，跳起来从容不迫，给人以舒适、悠闲、平和、自由之感。其舞步易于掌握，具有斯文、高雅的气度，因而有“标准桥梁”的雅号，并被称为启蒙舞蹈。



以上介绍的都属于现代的交谊舞，后来的交谊舞则以拉丁舞为主，比如伦巴（Rumba）, 恰恰（Cha Cha Cha）, 桑巴（Samba）, 斗牛（Paso Doble）, 牛仔舞（Jive）等等，这些舞蹈风格带着拉丁民族特有的热情奔放，如果能掌握一种也是可以在舞会上羡煞旁人的哦~

"What are you going to do? Sell them in Bayonne?"

"No. Drink out of them."

He slapped me on the back.

"Good man. Eight pesetas for the two. The lowest price."

The man who was stencilling the new ones and tossing them into a pile stopped.

"It's true," he said. "Eight pesetas is cheap."

I paid and went out and along the street back to the wine-shop.

It was darker than ever inside and very crowded.

I did not see Brett and Bill, and some one said they were in the back room. At the counter the girl filled the two wine-skins for me.

One held two litres. The other held five litres. Filling them both cost three pesetas sixty centimos.

Some one at the counter, that I had never seen before, tried to pay for the wine, but I finally paid for it myself.

The man who had wanted to pay then bought me a drink.

He would not let me buy one in return, but said he would take a rinse of the mouth from the new wine-bag.

"All right," he said, and handed back the bag.

In the back room Brett and Bill were sitting on barrels surrounded by the dancers.

Everybody had his arms on everybody else's shoulders, and they were all singing.

Mike was sitting at a table with several men in their shirt-sleeves, eating from a bowl of tuna fish, chopped onions and vinegar.

They were all drinking wine and mopping up the oil and vinegar with pieces of bread.

"Hello, Jake. Hello!" Mike called.

"Come here. I want you to meet my friends. We're all having an hors d'oeuvre."

I was introduced to the people at the table.

They supplied their names to Mike and sent for a fork for me.

"Stop eating their dinner, Michael," Brett shouted from the wine-barrels.

"I don't want to eat up your meal," I said when some one handed me a fork.

"Eat," he said. "What do you think it's here for?"

I unscrewed the nozzle of the big wine-bottle and handed it around.

Every one took a drink, tipping the wine-skin at arm's length.

Outside, above the singing, we could hear the music of the procession going by.

"Isn't that the procession?" Mike asked.

"Nada ([西]没有的事)," some one said. "It's nothing. Drink up. Lift the bottle."

"Where did they find you?" I asked Mike.

"Some one brought me here," Mike said. "They said you were here."

"Where's Cohn?"

"He's passed out," Brett called. "They've put him away somewhere."

"Where is he?" "I don't know."

"How should we know," Bill said. "I think he's dead."

"He's not dead," Mike said. "I know he's not dead. He's just passed out on Anis del Mono ([西]茴香酒)."

> <font color=red>"He's not dead," Mike said. "I know he's not dead. He's just passed out on Anis del Mono."</font>

As he said Anis del Mono one of the men at the table looked up, brought out a bottle from inside his smock, and handed it to me.

"No," I said. "No, thanks!"

"Yes. Yes. Arriba ([西]举起来)! Up with the bottle!"

I took a drink. It tasted of licorice and warmed all the way. I could feelit warming in my stomach.

"Where the hell is Cohn?"

"I don't know," Mike said. "I'll ask. Where is the drunken comrade?" heasked in Spanish.

> ==comrade英 [ˈkɒmreɪd] 美 [ˈkɑ:mræd] n. 同志;战友;忠实伙伴==

"You want to see him?" "Yes," I said.

"Not me," said Mike. "This gent."

The Anis del Mono man wiped his mouth and stood up."Come on."

In a back room Robert Cohn was sleeping quietly on some wine-casks.

It was almost too dark to see his face.

They had covered him with a coat and another coat was folded under his head.

Around his neck and on his chest was a big wreath of twisted garlics.

"Let him sleep," the man whispered."He's all right."

Two hours later Cohn appeared. He came into the front room still with the wreath of garlics around his neck.

The Spaniards shouted when he came in. Cohn wiped his eyes and grinned.

"I must have been sleeping," he said.

"Oh, not at all," Brett said.

"You were only dead," Bill said.

"Aren't we going to go and have some supper?" Cohn asked.

"Do you want to eat?"

"Yes. Why not? I'm hungry."

"Eat those garlics, Robert," Mike said. "I say. Do eat those garlics."

Cohn stood there. His sleep had made him quite all right.

"Do let's go and eat," Brett said. "I must get a bath."

"Come on," Bill said. "Let's translate Brett to the hotel."

We said good-bye to many people and shook hands with many people and went out. Outside it was dark.

"What time is it do you suppose?" Cohn asked.

"It's to-morrow," Mike said. "You've been asleep two days."

"No," said Cohn, "what time is it?"

"It's ten o'clock." "What a lot we've drunk."

"You mean what a lot we've drunk. You went to sleep."

Going down the dark streets to the hotel we saw the skyrockets going up in the square.

It was a big meal at the hotel. It was the first meal of the prices being doubled for the fiesta, and there were several new courses.

After the dinner we were out in the town.

I remember resolving that I would stay up all night to watch the bulls go through the streets at six o'clock in the morning, and being so sleepy that I went to bed around four o'clock.

The others stayed up.My own room was locked and I could not find the key, so I went up-stairs and slept on one of the beds in Cohn's room.

The fiesta was going on outside in the night, but I was too sleepy for it to keep me awake.

When I woke it was the sound of the rocket exploding that announced the release of the bulls from the corrals at the edge of town.

They would race through the streets and out to the bull-ring.

I had been sleeping heavily and I woke feeling I was too late. I put on a coat of Cohn's and went out on the balcony.

Down below the narrow street was empty. All the balconies were crowded with people.

Suddenly a crowd came down the street.

They were all running, packed close together.

They passed along and up the street toward the bull-ring and behind them came more men running faster, and then some stragglers who were really running.

Behind them was a little bare space, and then the bulls galloping, tossing their heads up and down.

It all went out of sight around the corner. One man fell, rolled to the gutter, and lay quiet.

But the bulls went right on and did not notice him. They were all running together.

After they went out of sight a great roar came from the bull-ring. It kept on.

Then finally the pop of the rocket that meant the bulls had gotten through the people in the ring and into the corrals.

I went back in the room and got intobed.

I had been standing on the stone balcony in bare feet.

I knew our crowd must have all been out at the bull-ring. Back in bed, I went to sleep.

### 背景知识

**💧****西方人也爱大蒜？**

今天的内容里有一个很有意思的细节，Cohn睡觉的时候脖子上还挂着当地人给他戴的一圈大蒜（They had hung a wreath of garlics around her neck）. 其实大蒜在西餐里也几乎有着和在中餐里相等的地位，可谓是中西餐桌通杀。

大蒜最早可能出现在古埃及地区，比如在埃及的艾玛哈萨（El-Mahasna）发现的陵墓中，就有大蒜模样的泥塑——一个小圆柱被瓣状物包围着，距今约公元前3700年，足以说明大蒜的重要性非同小可。

犹太人也有着悠久的嗜食大蒜的传统。据圣经记载，当年摩西带着族人逃出埃及，前往上帝“应许之地”——迦南（今以色列和巴勒斯坦，以及黎巴嫩和叙利亚临海的部分地区）。因为食物不足、路途劳累，不少人怀念起在埃及吃过的鲜鱼、西瓜还有美味的大蒜。这是圣经里唯一一次提到大蒜，也从侧面说明了大蒜在古犹太人生活中的重要地位。

值得一提的是，在被放逐流散的岁月中，犹太人将大蒜带到了世界上的其他地方，这算得上是犹太文明的诸多贡献之一。在很多国家，大蒜被认为和犹太人息息相关，比如俄罗斯人曾就这种食物的杀菌作用说，大蒜是犹太人的“盘尼西林”（Penicillin）；在今天德国柏林的犹太人博物馆里，还保存有一个巨大的大蒜模型。

现在的以色列人，很多并非正统犹太教徒，但爱吃大蒜的习俗一直延续下来。在这里，大蒜不再是简单的调料，而是大摇大摆进入当地人的正餐菜单中，并且不断推陈出新。以色列最流行的法拉费尔、胡姆斯等小吃，里面都有蒜泥或蒜汁。而用整粒大蒜烹制海鲜，更是地中海沿岸的流行做法。

还有人声称大蒜一开始并不是作为食物的调料被使用的，而是作为一种药材。后来蒜头还被赋予了一些神奇的用途——比如帮逝去的法老王抵挡邪恶生物；在中世纪时，大蒜还被用来对抗吸血鬼。

### 课文理解

我们昨天分析的第一条线索里提到，在狂欢节上，人们的价值观念也在发生变化，比如对于“不公平交易”这件事似乎也是可以容忍的——

💧**Clue 1**: The unfair deal is accepted during the fiesta.



**Evidence 1**: At the counter the girl filled the two wine-skins for me. One held two litres. The other held five litres. Filling them both cost three pesetas sixty centimos.

柜台的女堂倌给我往这两个皮袋里灌酒。一个装了两公升，另一个装了五公升。装两袋酒花了三比塞塔六十生丁。



**Evidence 2**: It was a big meal at the hotel. It was the first meal of the prices being doubled for the fiesta, and there were several new courses.

旅馆的这顿晚餐异常丰盛。这是第一顿节日饭菜，价钱贵一倍，多加了几道菜。



首先是在酒馆里的时候，两个酒袋灌的量不一样，其次是在旅馆吃饭价钱贵了一倍。这一段细节描写说明了Jake在心里其实算计得很清楚，但表面上却一声不吭。

在狂欢节上颠覆的另一件事还有——Cohn居然喝醉了。Jake在前面的内容里提到过，在他们这一伙人里，Cohn是唯一一个从不喝醉酒的（Mike was a bad drunk. Brett was a good drunk. Bill was a good drunk. Cohn was never drunk. — Chapter 14）. 但是在今天的故事里，Cohn不仅喝醉了，还倒在酒馆的后厢里呼呼大睡——



💧**Clue 2**: Cohn should get drunk and pass out.



**Evidence 1**: "Where's Cohn?"

"He's passed out," Brett called. "They've put him away somewhere."

“科恩在哪里呢？”

“他晕过去了。”勃莱特说。“他们应该是把他带到哪休息了。”



**Evidence 2**: In a back room Robert Cohn was sleeping quietly on some wine-casks. It was almost too dark to see his face. They had covered him with a coat and another coat was folded under his head. Around his neck and on his chest was a big wreath of twistedgarlics.

在一间里屋里，罗伯特·科恩安详地睡在几只酒桶上。屋里很暗，简直看不清他的脸。人家给他盖上一件外衣，叠起了另外一件外衣枕在他头下面。他脖子上套着一个用蒜头拧成的大花环。



在Jake的描述里，狂欢节似乎也带上了一层魔幻的性质。主角们的行为虽然有悖于日常，但又是合情合理的。这也为接下来要发生的故事埋下了伏笔。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****英语里最容易混淆的标点符号**

我们平时很强调的“语法正确”里 ，大部分人都忽略了的一项是“标点正确”。在英语里标点不只用来断句，它还会影响词语的构成、分句的组合，甚至含义的表达。比如今天我们要介绍的三个在英语里最容易混淆的标点符号，虽然看起来都差不多，但其实各有门道。我们先来看看它们在句子里分别长什么样子：



non-English-speaking peoples

（非英语民族）

the post–World War II years

（二战后的岁月）

She outlined the strategy—a strategy that would, she hoped, secure the peace.

（她大致规划了一个策略——这个策略是她希望可以用来维持和平局面的。）

大家认出了几个呢？答案揭晓↓

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/19225c72a498f4e15605c9ec20be66e4-sz_19126.JPEG?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



第一个hyphen其实也就是我们说的“连字符”，这个最好理解了，它的用处就是构成复合词（compound）, 大致可以分为以下几类：

①复合动词

sleep-walk 梦游

sun-bathe 做日光浴

white-wash 粉刷



②复合名词

sleeping-pills 安眠药

double-dealer 两面派

take-away 熟食



③复合形容词

noble-minded 高尚的

easy-going 好说话的

new-born 新生的



细心的大家可能会发现，第二个例子（the post–World War II years）里不也是把两个词连起来么？为什么它不叫hyphen而是en-dash呢？我们再仔细看一下这里的复合结构：post–World War II（注意World War II本身就是一个复合词，只不过把连字符“-”隐藏了没写出来而已。）



所以en-dash（也可以称作短破折号）的第一个用法其实就是相当于hyphen的升级版，当连接的两个词中有一个本身就是复合词的时候，就要把hyphen替换为稍长一点的en-dash了。我们在例句里对比一下：



Hyphen: It was just one of many changes in this post-Clinton era.

（这只是“后克林顿时代”的诸多改变之一。）

En dash: It was just one of many changes in this post–New Deal era.

（这只是“后（罗斯福）新政时代”的诸多改变之一。）



Hyphen: He submitted his manuscript to a print-only publisher.

（他把手稿提交给了只印刷纸质出版物的出版商。）

En dash: He submitted his manuscript to an e-book–only publisher.

（他把手稿提交给了只出版电子书的出版商。）

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/5594dd1c9594d258f21a3d9519f9475b-sz_8691.png)



除此以外，en-dash还可以用来连接数字或者是方向名词，这时候它就相当于介词“to”或“through”，比如：



You will find this material in chapters 8–12.

（你可以在第8章到第12章的内容里找到这个材料。）



There is a north–south railway in the same area as the highway that runs east–west.

（这片区域分别有一条南北向的铁路以及一条东西向的公路。）



最后我们再来看看和汉语里的破折号用法最相近的em-dash（长破折号）。它在英语标点里可以算是最神通广大的一个了，只要有逗号、冒号、分号、括号甚至句号的地方，都可以用它来替换而且完全不会出错（必备偷懒神器！）

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/916f63e3cab51dbf1200fedeb3c96d04-sz_642539.jpg?x-oss-process=image/resize,w_1080/auto-orient,1/crop,x_0,y_0,w_1080,h_528)



①代替逗号（让句子结构看起来更清晰）

And yet, when the car was finally delivered—nearly three months after it was ordered—she decided she no longer wanted it.

结果，在下单后的三个月，汽车厂家终于给她发货了，她却不想要这辆车了。



②代替括号（比括号的强调语气更重）

Jake studied (all night) for the grammar test.

Jake studied—all night—for the grammar test.

Jake为了语法考试学了一整晚。



③代替句号（句子更简洁）

One thing's for sure. The thing is that he doesn't want to face the truth.

One thing’s for sure—he doesn’t want to face the truth.

可以确定的一件事是——他不想面对现实。



*和冒号一样，长破折号是可以直接把两个完整句连起来而不必考虑使用连词的。



学会了这三个标点的用法，记得检查自己的写作里有没有犯错哦~

Cohn woke me when he came in.

He started to undress and went over and closed the window because the people on the balcony of the house just across the street were looking in.

"Did you see the show?" I asked.

"Yes. We were all there."

"Anybody get hurt?"

"One of the bulls got into the crowd in the ring and tossed six or eight people."

"How did Brett like it?"

"It was all so sudden there wasn't any time for it to bother anybody."

"I wish I'd been up."

"We didn't know where you were. We went to your room but it was locked."

"Where did you stay up?" "We danced at some club."

"I got sleepy," I said.

"My gosh! I'm sleepy now," Cohn said. "Doesn't this thing ever stop?"

"Not for a week."Bill opened the door and put his head in.

"Where were you, Jake?" "I saw them go through from the balcony. How was it?"

"Grand." "Where you going?" "To sleep."

No one was up before noon.

We ate at tables set out under the arcade. The town was full of people.

We had to wait for a table. After lunch we went over to the Irufla.

It had filled up, and as the time for the bull-fight came it got fuller, and the tables were crowded closer.

There was a close, crowded hum that came every day before the bull-fight.

The café did not make this same noise at any other time, no matter how crowded it was.

This hum went on, and we were in it and a part of it.

I had taken six seats for all the fights.

Three of them were barreras, the first row at the ring-side, and three were sobrepuertos, seats with wooden backs, half-way up the amphitheatre.

Mike thought Brett had best sit high up for her first time, and Cohn wanted to sit with them.

Bill and I were going to sit in the barreras, and I gave the extra ticket to a waiter to sell.

Bill said something to Cohn about what to do and how to look so he would not mind the horses.

Bill had seen one season of bull-fights.

"I'm not worried about how I'll stand it. I'm only afraid I may be bored," Cohn said.

"You think so?"

"Don't look at the horses, after the bull hits them," I said to Brett. "Watch the charge and see the picador try and keep the bull off, butthen don't look again until the horse is dead if it's been hit."

"I'm a little nervy about it," Brett said. "I'm worried whether I'll be able to go through with it all right."

> ==nervy英[ˈnɜ:vi] 美[ˈnɜ:rvi] adj. 紧张不安的;<英><俚>神经质的;焦虑的;<美><俚>有勇气的==

"You'll be all right. There's nothing but that horse part that will bother you, and they're only in for a few minutes with each bull. Just don't watch when it's bad."

"She'll be all right," Mike said. "I'll look after her."

"I don't think you'll be bored," Bill said.

"I'm going over to the hotel to get the glasses and the wineskin," I said. "See you back here. Don't get cock-eyed."

"I'll come along," Bill said. Brett smiled at us.

We walked around through the arcade to avoid the heat of the square.

"That Cohn gets me," Bill said. "He's got this Jewish superiority so strong that he thinks the only emotion he'll get out of the fight will be being bored."

"We'll watch him with the glasses," I said.

"Oh, to hell with him!" "He spends a lot of time there."

"I want him to stay there."In the hotel on the stairs we met Montoya.

"Come on," said Montoya. "Do you want to meet Pedro Romero?"

"Fine," said Bill. "Let's go see him."

We followed Montoya up a flight and down the corridor.

"He's in room number eight," Montoya explained. "He's getting dressed for the bull-fight."

Montoya knocked on the door and opened it.

It was a gloomy room with a little light coming in from the window on the narrow street.

There were two beds separated by a monastic partition.

The electric light was on. The boy stood very straight and unsmiling in his bull-fighting clothes.

His jacket hung over the back of a chair. They were just finishing winding his sash.

His black hair shone under the electric light. He wore a white linen shirt and the swordhandler finished his sash and stood up and stepped back.

Pedro Romero nodded, seeming very far away and dignified when we shook hands. Montoya said something about what great aficionados we were, and that we wanted to wish him luck.

Romero listened very seriously. Then he turned to me. He was the best-looking boy I have ever seen.

"You go to the bull-fight," he said in English."You know English," I said, feeling like an idiot.

"No," he answered, and smiled.

One of three men who had been sitting on the beds came up and asked us if we spoke French.

"Would you like me to interpret for you? Is there anything you would like to ask Pedro Romero?"

We thanked him. What was there that you would like to ask?

The boy was nineteen years old, alone except for his sword-handlet and the three hangers-on, and the bull-fight was to commence in twenty minutes.

We wished him "Mucha suerte ([西]祝你幸运)," shook hands, and went out.

He was standing, straight and handsome and altogether by himself, alone in the room with the hangers-on as we shut the door.

>
> 在任何一个艺术家圈子里，每一两位有才华的人身边儿总会有一帮无能的阿谀奉承者。

"He's a fine boy, don't you think so?" Montoya asked.

"He's a good-looking kid," I said.

"He looks like a torero," Montoya said. "He has the type."

"He's a fine boy." "We'll see how he is in the ring," Montoya said.

We found the big leather wine-bottle leaning against the wall in my room,took it and the field-glasses, locked the door, and went down-stairs.

It was a good bull-fight. Bill and I were very excited about Pedro Romero.

Montoya was sitting about ten places away. After Romero had killed his first bull Montoya caught my eye and nodded his head.

This was a real one. There had not been a real one for a long time. Of the other two matadors, one was very fair and the other was passable.

But there was no comparison with Romero, although neither of his bulls was much.

Several times during the bull-fight I looked up at Mike and Brett and Cohn, with the glasses.

They seemed to be all right. Brett did not look upset.

All three were leaning forward on the concrete railing in front of them.

"Let me take the glasses," Bill said.

"Does Cohn look bored?" I asked.

"That kike!" Outside the ring, after the bull-fight was over, you could not move in the crowd.

We could not make our way through but had to be moved with the whole thing, slowly, as a glacier, back to town.

We had that disturbed emotional feeling that always comes after a bull-fight, and the feeling of elation that comes after a good bullfight. The fiesta was going on.

The drums pounded and the pipe music was shrill, and everywhere the flow of the crowd was broken by patches of dancers.

Finally, we got out of the crowd and made for the café.

The waiter saved chairs for the others, and we each ordered an absinthe and watched the crowd in the square and the dancers.

"What do you suppose that dance is?" Bill asked.

"It's a sort of jota."

### 背景知识

**💧1. Amphitheatre** **斗牛场**

现在西班牙拥有300多家斗牛场，其国内的许多重要城市都设有圆形的斗牛竞技场，建筑物突显宏伟壮丽，占地面积极广，足可容纳上万人，其中最大的是马德里的拉斯文塔斯斗牛场，可容纳2.5万人。

斗牛场格局和古罗马的斗兽场相仿，一般都为露天的竞技场，四周是水泥台阶的观众席。向阳的座位门票较便宜，而太阳照射不到的座位较贵些。椭圆形的竞技场中央为斗牛场地，表面薄薄地铺着均匀的黄沙，斗牛士与牛的搏命拼斗便在这个区域上演。

斗牛场地周围设有2米高的厚木板墙栏、通道，使之与观众席隔开。四面则有可随时启闭的门，以控制人兽的出入。门与围墙之间有较宽的缝隙，当斗牛场面不能为人所控制时，斗牛士可以暂时躲进这里，以避开牛的锋芒，避免不必要的受伤。在主席台的正对面和左面的观众席最上方，各有一支铜管乐队，他们指挥和调控着整个斗牛的程序。

**💧2. Procedure of bullfight 斗牛过程**

一场斗牛由三个斗牛士出场，共斗六条公牛，每人两个回合。整个斗牛过程包括引逗、长矛穿刺、上花镖及正式斗杀四个部分。

其中最重要的两个角色分别是长矛手和主斗牛士（Romero是主斗牛士的身份，在明天的内容里会有他的精彩表演）——

其中的长矛手picador是西班牙斗牛中一对用长矛刺公牛的骑手之一。他们的目的首先是刺穿公牛脖子后面的肌肉（pierce the muscle），以使公牛的冲锋变直。当公牛试图用头抬起马时，使公牛的颈部肌肉和一般耐力疲劳为下一阶段做准备，降低公牛的头。

主斗牛士matador是整场斗牛的主角，也是全场氛围的主导者。除了一些常规动作，他还会使用一些冒险刺激的方法。例如，双膝跪地，手持红布，让牛擦身而过，每每场内出现这样的场景，就会引起一次高分贝的惊呼，最后一手握着有柄红巾，一手持剑，伺机直刺公牛心脏，将它杀死。

### 课文理解

在斗牛比赛开始前，酒馆老板Montoya特地带着Jake和Bill和一位即将在比赛中上场的斗牛士Romero见面。Montoya对他赞不绝口，而Jake对这位又年轻又帅气的斗牛士的惊叹也可以从字里行间体会出来——

💧**Clue 1**: Jake is much surprised at the appearance of Romero.

**Evidence 1**: Romero listened very seriously. Then he turned to me. He was the best-looking boy I have ever seen.

罗梅罗听得非常认真，然后朝我转过身来。他是我平生所见最漂亮的翩翩少年。



**Evidence 2**: "He's a fine boy, don't you think so?" Montoya asked.

"He's a good-looking kid," I said.

"He looks like a torero," Montoya said. "He has the type."

"He's a fine boy."

“他是个好小伙，你们说呢？”蒙托亚问。

“确实漂亮。”我说。

“他长得就像个斗牛士，”蒙托亚说。“他有斗牛士的风度。”

“他是个好小伙。”我说。



除了长相漂亮，Romero身上还有很吸引人的一点，Jake在两处细节都有提及，也就是他让人感觉十分疏远自持，比如他们H第一眼eRomero的时候，他只是回过头来稍微示意（Pedro Romero nodded, seeming very far away and dignified when we shook hands）. 最后离开的时候，他依然似乎只有自己在那儿似的，尽管旁边还有其他侍从，但他给人的感觉就是形单影只（He was standing, straight and handsome and altogether by himself, alone in the room with the hangers-on as we shut the door）.



并且事实证明，他在斗牛场上的表现也十分出色，另外两个斗牛手完全不能和他相比（But there was no comparison with Romero, although neither of his bulls was much）. 所以Jake形容他是一个“真正的斗牛士”（This was a real one. There had not been a real one for a long time）.



在比赛开始前，由于Brett和Cohn都是第一次看斗牛，其余的人便提醒到在公牛攻击马的时候尽量回避不看。随后Brett, Mike和Cohn一起坐在了位置比较高的地方（这样距离远点可以减少冲击），而Jake和Bill则坐在了第一排。期间，Jake一直用望远镜观察Brett的反应（Several times during the bull-fight I looked up at Mike and Brett and Cohn, with the glasses）, 单凭这个来看Brett似乎没有他原先所担心的不适——



💧**Clue 2**: Brett is pretty fine with the scene.



**Evidence 1**: "I'm a little nervy about it," Brett said. "I'm worried whether I'll be able to go through with it all right."

“我有点儿紧张。”勃莱特说。“我担心能不能好好地从头看到尾。”



**Evidence 2**: They seemed to be all right. Brett did not look upset. All three were leaning forward on the concrete railing in front of them.

他们似乎一切正常。勃莱特看来并没有受到困扰。他们三人都探着身子跃在前面的混凝土栏杆上。



Brett丝毫不畏惧斗牛的场面，这一点给Jake带来的可能是惊喜也可能是失望。而且Brett的真实反应和感受甚至会让Jake产生不安和嫉妒，尤其是在明天内容里会出现的第二场斗牛赛上，Jake会再次受到打击和折磨。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****Misconceptions about animals**

**我们对动物都有什么误解？**



今天的故事里斗牛赛就正式开始了。但大家对斗牛其实一直都有一个误解，比如斗牛士主要靠挥动一块大红布来激怒公牛。但生物学家爱研究后得出了一个完全相反的结论：牛会被激怒根本不是因为红色！我们来看看科学的解释——



\1. Myth: Bulls can be aroused by the color red.

牛讨厌红色，红色会激怒它



事实就是，牛其实是色盲，所以不管斗牛士拿着什么颜色的布，只要晃动，都会对牛产生刺激，就会让它们向前冲。而使用红布的主要目的，反而是为了刺激在场的观众的情绪，让气氛能够激烈高昂，同时增大欢呼声也有利于斗牛士的发挥。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/3e76cd35b531ab10fdaccc28c665d942-sz_396906.jpg?x-oss-process=image/resize,w_1080/auto-orient,1/crop,x_0,y_0,w_1080,h_589)



还有一个原因是，牛在事先就被关在牛栏里，牛栏比较狭小，用于斗牛的牛又是暴脾气，在山呼海啸般的浪潮中，只要放它出牛栏，它自然就是带着一股气冲出去，即便斗牛士是赤手空拳，也是会激发它的怨气的。



\2. Myth: As blind as a bat!

像蝙蝠一样瞎



As blind as a bat 是一句英语里的谚语，意思就是“像瞎子一样”（比如：I’m as blind as a bat without my glasses. 我不戴眼镜就像瞎子一样）。



但事实上，蝙蝠不仅不瞎，白天的视力（daylight vision）可能比人类的还要好呢！比如它们的眼睛结构完整，视蛋白（眼部感光物质的主要组成部分）还会根据光线不同发生变化，这证明视觉对它们仍然很重要。某些种类的蝙蝠甚至还能看到大多数哺乳动物都看不到的波长较短的紫外线。



这个误解可能是最早的时候科学家做实验弄瞎了实验蝙蝠的眼睛，发现蝙蝠却依然可以敏捷飞行并且进行捕食后便一厢情愿地认为它们看不见。但蝙蝠只是习惯于依赖超声波（ultrasonic sounds）活动而已，这样即便在黑暗中它们也可以准确定位猎物（to locate their pary even in the dark）.



\3. Myth: An ostrich will bury his head in sand when in danger.

鸵鸟遇到危险会把头埋在沙子里。



鸵鸟在英文里是ostrich, 这个词经常会被用来指“逃避现实的人”，这是因为人们误解鸵鸟在遇到危险的时候会把头埋在沙子里逃避：只要我看不到敌人，敌人就看不见我了（If I can't see the predator, it means that the predator cannot see me）！所以bury one's head in sand还变成了一个固定表达，专门用来调侃“逃避现实、掩耳盗铃”的这种行为。



但生物学家告诉我们，鸵鸟这种有着一流逃生技能的动物可不是这么躲避攻击的。鸵鸟的奔跑速度可以达到每小时70公里之快，跳跃的高度能达到3.5米之高，所以真遇上捕食者的追杀，它们完全可以靠“跑”的！况且，即便躲不开，它们也可以凭借着自己强有力的双腿和捕食者拼死一战。



至于鸵鸟为什么要把头埋进沙子里，可能只是因为它们在沙子里找东西而已（It could be simply exploring it）!

## Chapter 15.4

In front of us on a clear part of the street a company of boys were dancing.

The steps were very intricate and their faces were intent and concentrated.

They all looked down while they danced.

Their rope-soled shoes tapped and spatted on the pavement.

The toes touched. The heels touched.

The balls of the feet touched.

Then the music broke wildly and the step was finished and they were all dancing on up the street.

"Here come the gentry," Bill said.

> <font color=red>"Here come the gentry," Bill said.</font>

> “咱们的同伙来了。”比尔说。

> gentry 来源于法语，和gentleman相近，指“上层社会人士，绅士阶层”（people belonging to a high social class）. 在狂欢节之前，几个人物彼此之间的称呼是chap “家伙，伙计”，但是在狂欢节上，他们开始互称gent “男士，先生”（比如Bill跟当地人说话的时候把Jake称作gent，以及这里Brett看到Jake和Bill叫他们gents）. 暗示了他们依然保持着在巴黎生活养成的尊贵心态，同时也讽刺了他们的身份地位和他们在狂欢节上恣意放荡的行为表现是冲突的。

They were crossing the street.

"Hello, men," I said.

"Hello, gents!" said Brett. "You saved us seats? How nice."

"I say," Mike said, "that Romero what's his name is somebody. Am I wrong?"

"Oh, isn't he lovely," Brett said. "And those green trousers."

"Brett never took her eyes off them."

"I say, I must borrow your glasses to-morrow."

"How did it go?"

"Wonderfully! Simply perfect. I say, it is a spectacle!"

"How about the horses?" "I couldn't help looking at them."

"She couldn't take her eyes off them," Mike said. "She's an extraordinary wench."

"They do have some rather awful things happen to them," Brett said. "I couldn't look away, though."

"Did you feel all right?" "I didn't feel badly at all."

"Robert Cohn did," Mike put in. "You were quite green, Robert."

"The first horse did bother me," Cohn said.

"You weren't bored, were you?" asked Bill.Cohn laughed.

"No. I wasn't bored. I wish you'd forgive me that."

"It's all right," Bill said, "so long as you weren't bored."

"He didn't look bored," Mike said. "I thought he was going to be sick."

"I never felt that bad. It was just for a minute."

"I thought he was going to be sick. You weren't bored, were you, Robert?"

"Let up on that, Mike. I said I was sorry I said it."

"Oh, shove it along, Michael."

"You mustn't ever get bored at your first bull-fight, Robert," Mike said. "It might make such a mess."

"Oh, shove it along, Michael," Brett said.

"He said Brett was a sadist," Mike said. "Brett's not a sadist. She's just a lovely, healthy wench."

"Are you a sadist, Brett?" I asked."Hope not."

"Won't be healthy long."

Bill got Mike started on something else than Cohn. The waiter brought the absinthe glasses.

"Did you really like it?" Bill asked Cohn.

"No, I can't say I liked it. I think it's a wonderful show."

"Gad, yes! What a spectacle!" Brett said.

"I wish they didn't have the horse part," Cohn said.

"They're not important," Bill said. "After a while you never notice anything disgusting."

"It is a bit strong just at the start," Brett said. "There's a dreadful moment for me just when the bull starts for the horse."

"The bulls were fine," Cohn said.

"They were very good," Mike said.

"I want to sit down below, next time." Brett drank from her glass of absinthe.

"She wants to see the bull-fighters close by," Mike said.

"They are something," Brett said. "That Romero lad is just a child."

"He's a damned good-looking boy," Isaid. "When we were up in his room I never saw a better-looking kid."

"How old do you suppose he is?" "Nineteen or twenty."

"Just imagine it."

The bull-fight on the second day was much better than on the first.

Brett sat between Mike and me at the barrera, and Bill and Cohn went up above.

Romero was the whole show. I do not think Brett saw any other bull-fighter.

No one else did either, except the hard-shelled technicians.It was all Romero.

There were two other matadors, but they did not count.

I sat beside Brett and explained to Brett what it was all about.

I told her about watching the bull, not the horse, when the bulls charged the picadors, and got her to watching the picador place the point of his pic so that she saw what it was all about,

so that it became more something that was going on with a definite end, and less of a spectacle with unexplained horrors.

I had her watch how Romero took the bull away from a fallen horse with his cape, and how he held him with the cape and turned him, smoothly and suavely, never wasting the bull.

She saw how close Romero always worked to the bull, and I pointed out to her the tricks the other bull-fighters used to make it look as though they were working closely.

She saw why she liked Romero's cape-work and why she did not like the others.

Romero never made any contortions, always it was straight and pure and natural in line.

The others twisted themselves like corkscrews, their elbows raised, and leaned against the flanks of the bull after his horns had passed, to give a faked look of danger.

Afterward, all that was faked turned bad and gave an unpleasant feeling.

Romero's bull-fighting gave real emotion, because he kept the absolute purity of line in his movements and always quietly and calmly let the horns pass him close each time.

He did not have to emphasize their closeness.

Brett saw how something that was beautiful done close to the bull was ridiculous if it were done a little way off.

I told her how since the death of Joselito all the bull-fighters had been developing a technique that simulated this appearance of dangerin order to give a fake emotional feeling, while the bull-fighter was really safe.

Romero had the old thing, the holding of his purity of line through the maximum of exposure, while he dominated the bull by making him realize he was unattainable, while he prepared him for the killing.

"I've never seen him do an awkward thing," Brett said.

"You won't until he gets frightened," I said.

"He'll never be frightened," Mike said. "He knows too damned much."

"He knew everything when he started. The others can't ever learn what he was born with."

"And God, what looks," Brett said.

"I believe, you know, that she's falling in love with this bullfighter chap," Mike said.

"I wouldn't be surprised."

"Be a good chap, Jake. Don't tell her anything more about him. Tell her how they beat their old mothers."

"Tell me what drunks they are."

"Oh, frightful," Mike said. "Drunk all day and spend all their time beatingtheir poor old mothers."

"He looks that way," Brett said.

"Doesn't he?" I said.

They had hitched the mules to the dead bull and then the whips cracked, the men ran, and the mules, straining forward, their legs pushing, broke into a gallop, and the bull, one horn up, his head on its side, swept a swath smoothly across the sand and out the red gate.

"This next is the last one."

"Not really," Brett said. She leaned forward on the barrera. Romero waved his picadors to their places,

then stood, his cape against his chest, looking across the ring to where the bull would come out.

After it was over we went out and were pressed tight in the crowd.

"These bull-fights are hell on one," Brett said. "I'm limp as a rag."

>
> 另外limp dishrag一般还可以用来指“办不成什么事的人”或者是“没有骨气的懦夫”（a totally helpless person; a cowardly and spineless person）.

"Oh, you'll get a drink," Mike said.

The next day Pedro Romero did not fight.

It was Miura bulls, and a very bad bull-fight.

The next day there was no bull-fightscheduled. But all day and all night the fiesta kept on.

### 背景知识

**💧****Cape 斗篷/披风**

今天的内容里提到Romero引逗公牛的时候，用到的一个物件是cape（I had her watch how Romero took the bull away from a fallen horse with his cape, and how he held him with the cape and turned him...）这里的cape指斗牛士用来引逗公牛的斗篷（一般其中一面是品红色，另一面是黄色；到了斗牛后面的进程，斗篷会换成大红布muleta）.

但在我们的日常生活里，斗篷（cape）主要是指一种无袖的外套装饰，松松地从后背搭到手臂和胸脯，一般还会在脖子上系紧（a sleeveless outer garment, which drapes the wearer's back, arms and chest, and fastens at the neck）, 相当于是topcoat（外套）. 斗篷在中世纪的欧洲一度非常流行，而且还是带兜帽（hood）的那种。

罗马天主教的神职人员（Roman Catholic clergyman）也兴穿斗篷，但在他们身上，斗篷就有了更尊贵的名称——Ferraiolone/Ferraiolo（神职披风），一般在非宗教礼仪的正式场合出现。它可以穿在肩膀上的，或者用一根与披风同等颜色的细布条打成蝴蝶结，将披风挂在自己的背后，长度到脚踝；这种披风没有任何的花纹装饰，是罗马公民的日常服饰之一，最初只到膝盖。

一件Ferraiolo是什么颜色，这是由佩戴这披风的教会内神职人员等级而决定的，在俗神父一般穿着纯黑色的Ferraiolo，紫色的则是由教皇陛下的首席书记官或教区主教穿，猩红色真丝水波绸的则是枢机主教穿。水波绸的Ferraiolo也表示穿戴者是教廷大使或直接听命于教皇，因此Ferraiolo的制作用料与颜色都非常严格。

斗篷也经常在社交的正式场合出现。比如名媛淑女参加晚宴的时候，一般会在晚礼服外面披一件斗篷，以免蹭坏了用料讲究的晚礼服（the fine fabrics of the evening wear）. 

经常和cape弄混的是cloak, 两者的区别主要在于，cape是指上身斗篷（a shorter garment），而cloak是全身的（a full-length garment）. 但其实大家一般都用这两个词来指全身斗篷。

另外cape还可以指雨衣外套（a long and roomy protective garment worn to keep one dry in the rain）. 

### 课文理解

这次在第二场斗牛赛上，对于Romero如何与公牛周旋搏斗有了更细致的描绘。Jake耐心地给Brett解释里面的门道，这让Brett对Romero愈加着迷钦佩，因为他的动作和气场都完全像一个真正的斗牛士，比如他的技巧和方法直接而纯粹——

💧**Clue 1**: The technique adpoted by Romero is direct and pure.

**Evidence 1**: She saw how close Romero always worked to the bull, and I pointed out to her the tricks the other bull-fighters used to make it look as though they were working closely.

她还看出罗梅罗老是在牛身边靠得那么近，我就给她指出别的斗牛士常常耍花招，来给人一种他们靠得很近的样子。



**Evidence 2**: Romero's bull-fighting gave realemotion, because he kept the absolute purity of line in his movements and always quietly and calmly let the horns pass him close each time.

罗梅罗的斗牛真正使人动情， 因为他的动作保持绝对洗练，每次总是沉着冷静地让牛角紧靠身边擦过去。



Romero从来不像其他斗牛士一样搞唬人的小把戏，所以只有他能真正在观众心里激起真正的情感（real emotion）. 作者在塑造Romero这个角色的时候，其实也赋予了他很多在其他主角人物身上缺乏的特质，比如他的真诚（genuineness）和直接（directness）——体现在斗牛技法上。



同时和其他人物相比，他所从事的职业更加具有意义和价值——和牛对抗，而Jake和Cohn都是不满于自己的工作（Jake derives no particular satisfaction from being a journalist nor Cohn from being an author）. 他们身上所缺乏的生活的真实感和热情在Romero斗牛的过程中可以说是得到了极致的体现，也正是这一点吸引了Brett（"I believe, you know, that she's falling in love with this bullfighter chap," Mike said）.



此外，这段精彩的描写其实也可以看作是海明威把斗牛和自己的写作相类比——



💧**Clue 2**: Hemingway compares the bullfighting to his writing.



**Evidence 1**: Romero never made any contortions, always it was straight and pure and natural in line.

罗梅罗从不故意扭摆身躯，他的动作总是那么直截了当、干净利落、从容自然。



**Evidence 2**: Brett saw how something that was beautiful done close to the bull was ridiculous if it were done a little way off.

勃莱特看出有些动作紧靠着牛做很优美，如果和牛稍微保持一点距离来做就很可笑。



line在这里可以理解为双关，line既可以表示“方式，方法”（way, method）, 也可以表示“字句”（a line of written words）. 因此作者在强调Romero的技法的同时也在暗指自己的写作也是这样简截了当、游刃自如，并没有多余的修辞或矫饰（rhetorical flourish）.



对于Romero来说，这是掌控公牛最好的方法——最大限度地把自己暴露，不迂回躲避（through the maximum of exposure）; 那么对于海明威而言，采取这种朴素直接的写作方法，则是为了让“主题”（subject）更加凸显，而不至于偏离了作品中心。大家可以再仔细读一遍这一段对于斗牛的描写，这些文字本身就是对海明威写作风格最好的诠释。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****“累瘫了”在写作中的花式表达**



Brett看完斗牛比赛之后说自己简直累坏了，全身软得像团棉花/抹布一样（I'm limp as a rag）. limp表示“软弱无力的”，在作家们的笔下还延伸出了不少比喻，比如：



Limp like cut vine-twig.   —Robert Browning

（像被割下来的藤条）

Limp as bags of oats. —Elbert Hubbard

（像一袋燕麦）

Limp as a chewed rag. —Rudyard Kipling

（像被啃过的破布）

Limp as your grandma’s Mother Hubbard gown.  —Wallace Irwin

（像祖母穿的哈伯德大妈装）

除了以上的比喻，还有以下词语也可以引申为表示累瘫软的状态：



\1. dead beat

I'm beat 在口语里可以表示累坏了，在前面加上dead语气更重（dead可以理解为extremely, very）,说明实在是精疲力竭了（exhausted）.

Come and sit down – you must be dead beat.

过来坐下吧，你肯定累坏了。



\2. bone-weary/breaking

这两个短语字面上意思是连骨头都累着了，或者是骨头都“断了”，其实也就是在指累到全身散架。

Volunteers all felt bone-weary after working for scores of hours.

工作了十几个小时，志愿者们都感到精疲力尽。



\3. dead on one's feet

这个短语字面上好像是“死在自己的脚上”的意思，但它其实表示的是“累得快晕过去/失去意识了”（near to the point of collapse or losing consciousness）. dead在这里表示tired to exhaustion（累到被掏空，整个人都像行尸走肉一样）。

Mom was in the kitchen all day and was dead on her feet.

妈妈在厨房忙活了一整天，都快累晕了。



*另外这个表达还可以指某样事物依然在运作，但其实已经跟瘫痪了没区别（still functioning, but past the point of usefulness or productivity; as good as defeated）.

The company has managed to remain open, but, truth be told, it's really been dead on its feet for the last year.

这家公司还在勉强维持营生，但说老实话，其实它在去年就已经无力回天了。



\4. run out of steam

我们知道蒸汽机是靠蒸汽来驱动引擎产生动力的，那么当蒸汽越来越少甚至没有了的时候，引擎就失去了动力，自然就运转不起来了。所以run out of steam也可以用来比喻一个人累到一点精神气都没了。

If you've run out of steam, maybe it's your body trying to tell you something.

如果你失去动力，也许是你的身体试图告诉你什么。
