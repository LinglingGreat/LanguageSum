The marvellous thing is that it's painless," he said. "That's how you know when it starts."

"Is it really?" "Absolutely. I'm awfully sorry about the odor though.

That must bother you." "Don't! Please don't."

The cot the man lay on was in the wide shade of a mimosa tree and as he looked out past the shade onto the glare of the plain,

I watched the way they sailed very carefully at first in case I ever wanted to use them in a story.

That's funny now." "I wish you wouldn't," she said.

"I'm only talking," he said.

"It's much easier if I talk. But I don't want to bother you."

"You know it doesn't bother me," she said.

"It's that I've gotten so very nervous not being able to do anything.

I think we might make it as easy as we can until the plane comes."

"Or until the plane doesn't come."

"Please tell me what I can do. There must be something I can do."

"You can take the leg off and that might stop it, though I doubt it.

Or you can shoot me. You're a good shot now. I taught you to shoot, didn't I?"

"Please don't talk that way. Couldn't I read to you?"

"Read what?" "Anything in the book that we haven't read."

"I can't listen to it," he said.

"Talking is the easiest. We quarrel and that makes the time pass."

"I don't quarrel. I never want to quarrel. Let's not quarrel any more.

No matter how nervous we get. Maybe they will be back with another truck today. Maybe the plane will come."

"I don't want to move," the man said.

"There is no sense in moving now except to make it easier for you."

"That's cowardly." "Can't you let a man die as comfortably as he can without calling him names? What's the use of clanging me?"

He looked over to where the huge, filthy birds sat, their naked heads sunk in the hunched feathers.

This was a pleasant camp under big trees against a hill, with good water,and close by, a nearly dry water hole where sand grouse flighted in the mornings.

"Wouldn't you like me to read?" she asked. She was sitting on a canvas chair beside his cot.

It says it's bad for you. I know it's bad for you."

"No," he said. "It's good for me."

So now it was all over, he thought. So now he would never have a chance to finish it.

So this was the way it ended, in a bickering over a drink.

Since the gangrene started in his right leg he had no pain and with the pain the horror had gone and all he felt now was a great tiredness and anger that this was the end of it.

For this, that now was coming, he had very little curiosity.

For years it had obsessed him; but now it meant nothing in itself.

> ==obsess英 [əbˈses] 美 [əbˈsɛs, ɑb-] vt. 使着迷；缠住，迷住；使困扰==

It was strange how easy being tired enough made it.

Now he would never write the things that he had saved to write until he knew enough to write them well.

Well, he would not have to fail at trying to write them either.

Maybe you could never write them, and that was why you put them off and delayed the starting.

Well he would never know, now.

"I wish we'd never come," the woman said.

She was looking at him holding the glass and biting her lip.

"You never would have gotten anything like this in Paris. You always said you loved Paris.

We could have stayed in Paris or gone anywhere. I'd have gone anywhere.

I said I'd go anywhere you wanted. If you wanted to shoot we could have gone shooting in Hungary and been comfortable."

"Your bloody money," he said.

"That's not fair," she said. "It was always yours as much as mine.

I left everything and I went wherever you wanted to go and I've done what you wanted to do. But I wish we'd never come here."

"You said you loved it." "I did when you were all right. But now I hate it.

I don't see why that had to happen to your leg. What have we done to have that happen to us?"

"I suppose what I did was to forget to put iodine on it when I first scratched it.

Then I didn't pay any attention to it because I never infect.

Then, later, when it got bad, it was probably using that weak carbolic solution when the other antiseptics ran out that paralyzed the minute blood vessels and started the gangrene."

> ③and started the gangrene “于是开始生坏疽了”；start意为“引起，引发”，这里指引发一种疾病——坏疽。

He looked at her, "What else" "I don't mean that."

> ==mechanic英 [məˈkænɪk] 美 [mɪˈkænɪk] n. 技工，机修工==

"I don't mean that." "If you hadn't left your own people, your god damned Old Westbury Saratoga,Palm Beach people to take me on. "

"Why, I loved you. That's not fair. I love you now. I'll always love you. Don't you love me?"

"No," said the man. "I don't think so.I never have."

"Harry, what are you saying? You're out of your head."

"No. I haven't any head to go out of."

"Don't drink that," she said. "Darling,please don't drink that. We have to do everything we can."

"You do it," he said. "I'm tired."

Now in his mind he saw a railway station at Karagatch and he was standing with his pack and that was the headlight of the Simplon-Offent cutting the dark now and he was leaving Thrace then after the retreat.

> ==retreat英 [rɪˈtri:t] 美 [rɪˈtrit] vi. 撤退，后退；撤销，作罢；（眼睛等）凹进；[航]向后倾斜 n. 撤回；静居处；引退期间；静思，静修==

That was one of the things he had saved to write, with, in the morning at breakfast, looking out the window and seeing snow on the mountains in Bulgaffa

and Nansen's Secretary asking the old man if it were snow and the old man looking at it and saying, No, that's not snow.

It's too early for snow. And the Secretary repeating to the other girls, No, you see.

It's not snow and them all saying It's not snow we were mistaken.

But it was the snow all right and he sent them on into it when he evolved exchange of populations.

> <font color=red>But it was the snow all right / and he sent them on into it / when he evolved exchange of populations.</font>

It was snow too that fell all Christmas week that year up in the Gauertal, that year they lived in the woodcutter's house with the big square porcelain stove that filled half the room,

> ==porcelain英 [ˈpɔ:səlɪn] 美 [ˈpɔ:rsəlɪn] n. 瓷，瓷器 adj. 瓷制的；精美的；脆的，易碎的==

and they slept on mattresses filled with beech leaves, the time the deserter came with his feet bloody in the snow.

> ==mattress英 [ˈmætrəs] 美 [ˈmætrɪs] n. 床垫；褥垫；空气垫；[建]沉排==

He said the police were right behind him and they gave him woolen socks and held the gendarmes talking until the tracks had drifted over.

In Schrunz, on Christmas day, the snow was so bright it hurt your eyes when you looked out from the Weinstube and saw every one coming home from church.

That was where they walked up the sleigh-smoothed urine-yellowed road along the river with the steep pine hills, skis heavy on the shoulder, and where they ran down the glacier above the Madlenerhaus,

the snow as smooth to see as cake frosting and as light as powder and he remembered the noiseless rush the speed made as you dropped down like a bird.

### 背景知识

**💧****Kilimanjaro**

**乞力马扎罗山**

我们新的故事发生在乞力马扎罗雪山脚下，今天我们先来了解一下乞力马扎罗山吧～

乞力马扎罗山被誉为"非洲屋脊"和"非洲第一高峰"，同时也是火山和雪山，海拔5895米， 屹立在坦桑尼亚的东北部。乞力马扎罗山在斯瓦希里语中意为“闪闪发光的山”，它在辽阔的热带东非大草原上拔地而起，周围没有其他山峰，因此被称为“非洲大陆之王”。山麓的气温有时高达59°C，而峰顶温度又常在—34°C左右，终年冰雪覆盖，所以又有“赤道雪峰”之称。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/ac2e209d9c4a7134a1e6c99426e88487-sz_481551.png)

白雪覆盖山顶的乞力马扎罗山



“巨大之山”、“白色之山”、“大篷车之山”都是乞力马扎罗山的解释，它们分别源自斯瓦希里（Swahili）、查嘎（Chagga）和马夏米（Machame）方言。“Kilimanjaro” 和斯瓦希里语“kililma”（意为“山之巅”）有关，单词的第二部分“njaro” 指的是雪。

东非大裂谷直至今天仍存在着地壳运动，乞力马扎罗正是较近的火山活动的结果。它的形成大约始于75万年以前，最初由三个大火山口组成。现在有两个主峰，一个叫基博，另一个叫马文济，两峰之间有一个10多公里长的马鞍形的山脊相连。根据研究，最近的一次大爆发可能在15-20万年前。

乞利马扎罗山四周都是山林， 那里生活着众多的哺乳动物， 其中一些还是濒于灭绝的种类。

乞力马扎罗山在坦桑尼亚人心中无比神圣，他们对乞力马扎罗山敬若神灵。很多部族每年都要在山脚下举行传统的祭祀活动，拜山神，求平安。他们把自己看作是“草原之帆”下的子民，绝不允许外人对雪山的任何不敬。

 乞力马扎罗山有两个独特的景观已成为民间传说。一是冻僵的美洲豹：它首次被当地的传教士发现并记录下来，此后因写入海明威的小说《乞力马扎罗的雪》而闻名，没有人知道这儿美洲豹到底在那儿干什么。二是野狗：1962年，两个登山者在海拔约5000米的地方遇到五条野狗，野狗跟着他们来到乌呼噜（自由）峰，随后消失在冰川顶端，再没出现过。

由于它的攀登难度不大，而且补给方便，对于登山爱好者而言，不吝于是一个天堂般的存在。攀登乞力马扎罗的线路中，选择最多的就是威士忌线（machame route 玛查姆线）和可口可乐线（marangu route 马兰古线）。

### 课文理解

接下来的六天里我们会读完《乞力马扎罗的雪》这篇短篇小说。海明威的“冰山理论”在他的短篇作品中更加发挥地淋漓尽致，比如小说一开篇就是两个人物的对话，但我们只有在下文才能了解明白他们的关系，以及他们正在遭遇什么境况。同时这篇小说的另一大特点是大量的闪回（以心理独白的形式呈现），这给理清故事脉络带来了很大的挑战，但也增添不少阅读趣味。

这个故事的背景是Harry和他的妻子Helen（在小说最后才提到了Helen这个名字，在前面我们只能看到作者用she来指代Helen）在非洲的大平原上，Harry的腿长了坏疽（gangrene），这是因为他没有用碘酒妥善处理被划破的伤口（"I suppose what I did was to forget to put iodine on it when I first scratched it"）, 最后又由于一系列的原因导致生坏疽。但由于他们的卡车不凑巧地坏了，最后只得等着救援飞机过来——

💧**Clue 1**: Harry and his wife are waiting for the plane to come to their rescue.



**Evidence 1**: "You know it doesn't bother me," she said. "It's that I've gotten so very nervous not being able to do anything. I think we might make it as easy as we can until the plane comes."

“你知道我不会烦的。”她说，“我只是因为什么都做不了，感到特别不安。我觉得我们应该尽量放松一点，等飞机来。”



**Evidence 2**: "If we would have hired a good mechanic instead of a half-baked Kikuyu driver, he would have checked the oil and never burned out that bearing in the truck."

“如果我们能雇一个好一点的机械师，而不是那个半吊子的吉库尤（非洲班图人的一支 ），他就会去检查车子的机油，卡车的轴承也就不会烧坏了。”



虽然妻子极力安慰并且想让他乐观起来，但Harry显然毫不买账，他的语气非常不讨好（"Or until the plane doesn't come."）并且一直沉浸在将死的恐惧和丧气里（"Don't be silly. I'm dying now. Ask those bastards."）



接下来在对Harry的心理描写中，我们可以得知给他带来强烈恐惧的，除了死亡，还有他对自己身为作家的担忧，因为他还没有创作出自己酝酿已久但迟迟未动笔的作品——



💧**Clue 2**:  Harry is in great anxiety that he hasn't write what he has saved for so long.



**Evidence 1**: So now it was all over, he thought. So now he would never have a chance to finish it. So this was the way it ended, in a bickering over a drink.

这么说一切都完了，他想，看来再也没有机会去完成它了。就这样结束了，在为该不该喝一杯的争执中命归黄泉。



**Evidence 2**: Now he would never write the things that he had saved to write until he knew enough to write them well. Well, he would not have to fail at trying to write them either.

他再也没有机会去写那些特意积攒下来、想等自己能写得足够好了再去写的东西了。不过，他也不会因为试图去写它们而经历挫折了。



Harry不顾妻子的劝告开始喝酒，面对妻子的鼓舞（"Don't drink that," she said. "Darling, please don't drink that. We have to do everything we can."）也只是冷淡地回应（"You do it," he said. "I'm tired."）



接着描写开始转向Harry的意识活动（Now in his mind he saw a railway station at Karagatch...）他回忆起自己在各个情景下看到的雪景（这一部分也就是他前面提到的自己酝酿的写作素材）。明天的内容开头还会继续今天结尾的独白哦~

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****The Covers in Different Colors**

**各种颜色封皮的“书”分别指什么？**



在我们今天的内容中出现了Black's，指一种防治常见疾病的小册子。在日常生活中黑皮书较为少见，因为“black book”在英语中通常是指“黑名单”或“记过簿”，所以英语国家很少使用黑皮书。我们今天就来一起了解一下不用颜色的“书”都代表哪些意义吧～



\1. 白皮书（White Book）

白皮书最初是因为书的封皮和正文所用的级皆为白色而得名。英语中“whitepaper”和“whitebook”汉语均译做白皮书。但两者是有区别的。

在英国，“whitepaper”主要指政府发表的短篇幅报告。任何题材、任何组织机构均可使用，亦可用于包含背景材料的政治性官方声明。“whitebook”篇幅较长，内容更为重要和充实，主要是有关重大事务的一种官方报告书。英国1965年4月用“whitebook”的形式发表了《关于直布罗陀问题的白皮书》，书名用白皮书，封皮也用白色。



\2. 蓝皮书（Blue Book）

蓝皮书早期主要指英国议会的一种出版物。因封皮是蓝色，故名。开始发行于1681年，自1836年才公开出售。后用于代指部分官方文件，通常代表的是学者的观点或者研究团队的学术观点。

还有一类蓝皮书是名人录、指南、手册之类的工具书，甚至包括纪念画册。如美国政府官员名录、社会名人录、国务院每月发行的驻美外交人员衔名录，以及美国一些大学做试题答案用的小册子也称蓝皮书（汉语可译为蓝皮簿）。



\3. 红皮书（Red Book）

使用红皮书的国家主要有西班牙、奥地利、英国、美国、土耳其、苏联等。有的用于官方文件，有的用于非官方文件。英国早在13世纪就有用财政方面的红皮书。英国的红皮书还用于官员名册、贵族名录和宫廷指南，并于1969年出版一本《红皮书》，副标题是《野生动物濒危》。有的国际组织也使用红皮书，如《国际电信联盟红皮书》。



\4. 黄皮书（Yellow Book）

黄皮书过去被泛指旧中国和法国等政府发表的重要报告书，因为习惯上使用黄色封皮，故有此名。

19世纪末，法国有一本黄皮书，内容是有关法国与中国就修筑滇越铁路进行的交涉。1971年台湾《中国月刊》社用私人署名发行过一本《中美关系黄皮书》，封皮也是黄皮书，并非官方文件，而是一种活页的美国国会议会住址簿。



\5. 绿皮书（Green Book）

意大利、墨西哥、英国和1947年以前印度发表的一种官方文件，有的称为绿皮书。

美国出版的华盛顿社交名册，封皮是绿色。此外，还有一种“green paper”也被译做绿皮书，是一国政府发表的一种绿色封皮的报告书，载有正在酝酿中的、尚未被政府采纳的建议。

Finally he lost it all. Everything, the Skischule money and all the season's profit and then his capital.

He could see him with his long nose, picking up the cards and then opening, "Sans Voir. ([法]视而不见)"

There was always gambling then. When there was no snow you gambled and when there was too much you gambled.

He thought of all the time in his life he had spent gambling.

But he had never written a line of that, nor of that cold, bright Christmas day with the mountains showing across the plain that Barkerhad flown across the lines to bomb the Austrian officers' leave train, machine-gunning them as they scattered and ran.

He remembered Barker afterwards coming into the mess and starting to tell about it.

And how quiet it got and then somebody saying, "You bloody murderous bastard."

The birds no longer waited on the ground. They were all perched heavily in a tree.

There were many more of them. His personal boy was sitting by the bed.

"Memsahib's gone to shoot," the boy said. "Does Bwana want?" "Nothing."

She had gone to kill a piece of meat and, knowing how he liked to watch the game, she had gone well away so she would not disturb this little pocket of the plain that he could see.

She was always thoughtful, he thought. On anything she knew about, or had read, or that she had ever heard.

It was not her fault that when he went to her he was already over.

How could a woman know that you meant nothing that you said; that you spoke only from habit and to be comfortable?

After he no longer meant what he said, his lies were more successful with women than when he had told them the truth.

It was not so much that he lied as that there was no truth to tell.

He had had his life and it was over and then he went on living it again with different people and more money, with the best of the same places, and some new ones.

But he would never do it, because each day of not writing, of comfort, of being that which he despised, dulled his ability and softened his will to work so that, finally, he did no work at all.

### 背景知识

**💧****Austria**

**奥地利**

在我们今天的内容中，Harry的思绪使他来到了奥地利，他想到了滑雪的情形。Harry 提到了奥地利的三个地名：Vorarlberg是奥地利西部一州；the Arlberg是奥地利西部蒂罗尔州的一乡村，该地以滑雪著称；Bludenz是奥地利福拉尔贝格州一区，是一个游览胜地。今天我们就来一起了解一下奥地利和它的滑雪情缘吧～

奥地利位于欧洲中部，是一个高度发达的资本主义国家，也是世界著名的山地国家之一。它的首都维也纳是欧洲古典音乐的摇篮，更是世界著名的音乐之都。下面我们要介绍一下奥地利有哪些有特色的地方。



\1. 维也纳（Vienna）

艺术之都维也纳整个城市都散发着很强的艺术气息，它的美术、戏剧，古典音乐、歌剧都发展得极为成熟，要去维也纳，必去的就是维也纳金色大厅，还有史蒂芬大教堂、阿尔贝蒂娜博物馆、霍夫堡皇宫、美泉宫、维也纳森林、维也纳艺术史博物馆也值得一去。



\2. 萨尔茨堡（ Salzburg）

位于奥地利西部，这里曾经出生过一个震惊过世界的音乐天才——莫扎特，他在萨尔茨堡生活了近二十年，除此之外这里还是赫伯特·冯·卡拉扬的故乡，这里被誉为世界文化遗产，这里的巴洛克风格建筑十分美丽，如萨尔茨堡天主教堂和米哈贝尔花园，这都是世界建筑史上的瑰宝。



\3. 因斯布鲁克（Innsbruck）

最吸引人的地方就是这里五颜六色的房屋，在以雪山为背景的因斯布鲁克十分迷人，完全构成了一幅摄人心魄的油画，美得那么惊心动魄，这里的圣雅可布大教堂、黄金屋顶（Godenes Dachl）、水晶世界（Swarovski Kristallwelten）都是十分值得一去的地方。



\4. 霍恩斯特维茨城堡（BurgHochosterwitz）

霍恩斯特维茨城堡是一个中世纪遗留下的城堡，它是奥地利最美和最有名的城堡，它坐落于一个一百六十米高的巨大岩石上，城堡和背景形成了一个童话般的仙境。



\5.  奥地利的滑雪情缘

 奥地利是一个全世界滑雪爱好者都向往的滑雪胜地，这里不仅有在全世界遥遥领先的滑雪器械、索道和缆车技术，也涌现出了许多的世界级滑雪冠军。冬季游走在奥地利的街头，随处可见滑雪背包客，堆雪人、泡温泉、滑雪小屋里喝啤酒、聊天……无论什么方式，人们都能在这里感受到冬日带来的快乐。

我们的内容中提到的Arlberg山畔有五个相连的旅游胜地：斯图本、圣克里斯托弗、圣安东、采尔斯、莱希，形成了奥地利第一大、世界第五大滑雪区。

### 课文理解

在Harry的意识里，他回想了过去许多在雪天里的场景，比如打牌赌钱、轰炸列车、山林狩猎等，这些几乎都发生在奥地利。回到现实中，他和妻子继续争吵着。通过他们的对话，我们可以发现在他们之间存在着一个根本的矛盾——

💧**Clue 1**: Harry is financially dependent on his wife.



**Evidence 1**: "If you have to go away," she said, "is it absolutely necessary to kill off everything you leave behind? I mean do you have to take away everything? Do you have to kill your horse, and your wife and burn your saddle and your armour?"

"Yes," he said. "Your damned money was my armour. My Sword and my Armour."

“如果你不得不离开人世，”她说。“你是不是非得把你身后的一切都斩尽杀绝不可吗？我的意思是，你一定要把一切都带走？你一定要杀死你的马，杀死你的妻子，烧掉你的马鞍和盔甲嘛？”

“对，”他说，“你那些该死的钱就是我的盔甲，就是我的剑和盔甲。”



**Evidence 2**: "You bitch," he said. "You rich bitch. That's poetry. I'm full of poetry now. Rot and poetry. Rotten poetry."

"Stop it. Harry, why do you have to turn into a devil now?"

"I don't like to leave anything," the man said. "I don’t like to leave things behind."

“你这个女人，”他说，“你这个富得流油的婊子。那是诗。我这会儿诗兴大发呢。腐朽和诗。腐朽的诗。”

“住嘴，哈利。你现在为什么一定要把自己变成恶魔呢？”

“我不想在身后留下什么。”男人说，“我不想留下任何东西。”



昨天我们提到，Harry的身份是一个作家（他的成就如何我们暂时还不知道），而在今天的内容里，他主动提起自己一直都在依赖妻子的经济收入生活（他把妻子的钱比作自己的“剑”和“盔甲”）。这里Harry的态度很矛盾，一方面他对妻子很不满，另一方面他又不得不依靠妻子的财政支持。



而他妻子的态度则是对丈夫无限宽容和慷慨，比如在昨天的内容里出现的一段对话："Your bloody money," he said. "That's not fair," she said. "It was always yours as much as mine. I left everything and I went wherever you wanted to go and I've done what you wanted to do. But I wish we'd never come here."（“你的臭钱。”他说。“太不公平了，”她说，“我的钱从来也是你的。我丢下了一切，去你想去的地方，做你想做的事情。但我后悔我们来了这里。”）



在发现妻子哭了之后，Harry改口安慰，接着一番甜言蜜语（"Don't pay any attention, darling, to what I say. I love you, really. You know I love you. I've never loved any one else the way I love you."）在这段话之后，作者一语道出了Harry只是在耍一场惯常的把戏（He slipped into the familiar lie he made his bread and butter by）.



在下文作者还对Harry的心理进行了一番细致的描写，从中流露出Harry不仅是对于妻子、更是对于一切女性所持有的鄙夷态度——



💧**Clue 2**: Harry has contempt for all women.



**Evidence 1**: How could a woman know that you meant nothing that you said; that you spoke only from habit and to be comfortable? After he no longer meant what he said, his lies were more successful with women than when he had told them the truth.

一个女人怎么会知道你在口是心非？知道你只是出于习惯和贪图舒适才这么说的？自从他开始言不由衷，和说真话时相比，他的谎言反而为他赢得了更多女人。



**Evidence 2**: It wasn't this woman's fault. If it had not been she it would have been another. If he lived by a lie he should try to die by it. He heard a shot beyond the hill.

不是这个女人的错。如果不是她，还会有另外一个女人。如果他以谎话为生，他就应该努力把谎话说到死。



谎言让他尝到了不少甜头和好处，这也是因为他在经历了生活的破灭之后，开始陷入一种无意义的重复之中（He had had his life and it was over and then he went on living it again with different people and more money, with the best of the same places, and some new ones）. 依靠谎言他至少可以维持物质层面上的舒适区，尽管这在精神追求上并不能给予他满足。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****非洲的野生动物园**

**Safari Parks in Africa**



我们今天的内容中有他们来到非洲进行狩猎旅行的叙述（Africa was where he had been happiest in the good time of his life, so he had come out here to start again. They had made this safari with the minimum of comfort.）在这里狩猎用到了safari这个词。曾经，作为欧洲的后花园，有钱人特别喜欢来非洲狩猎，在这个时候，safari指的是非洲大型的狩猎活动。



后来，动物保护主义兴起，西方人转变成非洲动物的守护者，safari也有了新定义，它指的是在旅行中通过观察和拍摄的方式与野生动物接触，人们通常以乘车或徒步的方式进行动物观光。非洲是我们共同的家园，没有了野生动物，人类也会失去应有的存在意义——这是Safari传播给游客的最重要的理念。



那么，在非洲，我们去哪儿看动物，去哪儿Safari呢？必须得去国家公园，它是非洲旅行的精华所在。今天我们就一起去非洲的国家公园观光吧～



\1. 塞伦盖蒂国家公园和马赛马拉国家公园——坦桑尼亚和肯尼亚

由于大部分景观都是热带草原，因此野生动植物的能见度非常高。两个国家的公园相互毗邻，最为人所知的是一年一度的牛羚迁徙，这种迁徙涉及马拉河的危险穿越，通常在7月或8月左右。在这里也很容易发现许多优秀的猫科动物。塞伦盖蒂公园的开放时间为3月至11月。



\2. 奥卡万戈三角洲——博茨瓦纳

奥卡万戈三角洲基本上是一个大型沼泽地，内陆流入卡拉哈里沙漠。这种现象使奥卡万戈三角洲成为鳄鱼，大象和狮子等野生动物的避风港。你可以听到大象和河马在晚上走过去。一旦你到达干燥的陆地，整个三角洲都会有徒步旅行，你很可能会遇到动物只做自己的事情。最佳的参观时间是在动物最活跃的潮湿季节。



\3. 克鲁格国家公园——南非

克鲁格靠近非洲的约翰内斯堡主要枢纽，交通便利，是当地人和游客的最爱，它是非洲最受欢迎的公园之一，园中一望无际的旷野上，分布着众多的大象、狮子、犀牛、羚羊、长颈鹿、野水牛、斑马、鳄鱼、河马、豹、猎豹、牛羚、黑斑羚、鸟类等异兽珍禽。植物方面有非洲独特的、高大的猴面包树。每年6～9月的旱季是入园观览旅行的最好季节。



\4.  恩戈罗恩戈罗自然保护区——坦桑尼亚

这个陨石坑形成于数百万年前一座巨大的火山爆发时。现在它是一个大型的天然动物园，里面有成千上万的动物。你可以在火山口的边缘露营，但晚上不要走出帐篷。动物可以自由地走进火山口，经常穿过没有遮挡的露营地。每当春天来临之际，几百万只的火烈鸟（红鹳）地聚集在火山口底部的咸水湖上，火烈鸟，与火山口内生长的各种花卉、植物交相辉映。

She shot very well this good, this rich bitch, this kindly caretaker and destroyer of his talent.

Nonsense. He had destroyed his talent himself.

Why should he blame this woman because she kept him well?

He had destroyed his talent by not using it, by betrayals of himself and what he believed in, by drinking so much that he blunted the edge of his perceptions, by laziness, by sloth, and by snobbery, by pride and by prejudice, by hook and by crook.

>
> ③by pride and by prejudice 借用了《傲慢与偏见》（Pride and Prejudice）的书名；
>
> ④by hook and by crook 是一个固定表达，表示“不择手段地”（by any possible means）;hook在这里指一种弧形切割工具（billhook），主要是用来收割或剪羊毛，而crook则指牧羊人手持的拐杖，这个表达起源于中世纪，当时的法律规定平民可以在皇家的林子里拾柴火，但必须是死木，同时也限制了只能用hook和crook这两种工具，所以平民们只能用hook和crook来收集尽量多的柴木，后来就延伸出“不择手段（不管多困难都要达成）”的意思，比如：He would have to see her again by hook or by crook.（他无论如何也要再见她一面。）

What was this? A catalogue of old books? What was his talent anyway?

It was a talent all right but instead of using it, he had traded on it.

It was never what he had done, but always what he could do.

And he had chosen to make his living with something else instead of a pen or a pencil.

It was strange, too, wasn't it, that when he fell in love with another woman, that woman should always have more money than the last one?

But when he no longer was in love, when he was only lying, as to this woman, now, who had the most money of all, who had all the money there was, who had had a husband and children,

who had taken lovers and been dissatisfied with them, and who loved him dearly as a writer, as a man, as a companion and as a proud possession;

> ==possession英 [pəˈzeʃn] 美 [pəˈzɛʃən] n. 有，所有，拥有；领地；财产，所有权，占有物，所有物；持有违禁物==

He had found that out but he would never write that, now, either.

No, he would not write that, although it was well worth writing.

Now she came in sight, walking across the open toward the camp.

She was wearing jodphurs and carrying her rifle.

The two boys had a Tommie slung and they were coming along behind her.

She was still a good-looking woman, he thought, and she had a pleasant body.

She had a great talent and appreciation for the bed, she was not pretty, but he liked her face, she read enormously, liked to ride and shoot and, certainly, she drank too much.

Her husband had died when she was still a comparatively young woman and for a while she had devoted herself to her two just-grown children, who did not need her and were embarrassed at having her about, to her stable of horses, to books, and to bottles.

She liked to read in the evening before dinner and she drank Scotch and soda while she read. By dinner she was fairly drunk and after a bottle of wine at dinner she was usually drunk enough to sleep.

That was before the lovers. After she had the lovers she did not drink so much because she did not have to be drunk to sleep.

But the lovers bored her. She had been married to a man who had never bored her and these people bored her very much.

Then one of her two children was killed in a plane crash and after that was over she did not want the lovers,

and drink being no anaesthetic she had to make another life. Suddenly, she had been acutely frightened of being alone.

But she wanted some one that she respected with her.

It had begun very simply. She liked what he wrote and she had always envied the life he led.

She thought he did exactly what he wanted to.

The steps by which she had acquired him and the way in which she had finally fallen in love with him were all part of a regular progression in which she had built herself a new life and he had tradedaway what remained of his old life.

He did not know. She would have bought him anything he wanted.

They had bolted, too, before he got the picture.

Here she came now. He turned his head on the cot to look toward her.

"Hello," he said. "I shot a Tommy ram," she told him.

"He'll make you good broth and I'll have them mash some potatoes with the Klim. How do you feel?"

"Much better.""Isn't that lovely?

You know I thought perhaps you would. You were sleeping when I left."

"I had a good sleep. Did you walk far?"

"No. Just around behind the hill. I made quite a good shot on the Tommy."

"You shoot marvellously, you know."

"I love it. I've loved Africa. Really.

If you're all right it's the most fun that I've ever had.

You don't know the fun it's been to shoot with you. I've loved the country."

"I love it too."

"Darling, you don't know how marvellous it is to see you feeling better.

I couldn't stand it when you felt that way.

You won't talk to me like that again,will you? Promise me?"

"No," he said. "I don't remember what I said."

"You don't have to destroy me. Do you?

I'm only a middle-aged woman who loves you and wants to do what you want to do.

I've been destroyed two or three times already.

You wouldn't want to destroy me again, would you?"

"I'd like to destroy you a few times in bed," he said.

"Yes. That's the good destruction.

That's the way we're made to be destroyed. The plane will be here tomorrow."

"We'll have one together. Molo, letti dui whiskey-soda!" she called.

"You'd better put on your mosquito boots," he told her.

"I'll wait till I bathe . . ."

While it grew dark they drank and just before it was dark and there was no longer enough light to shoot, a hyena crossed the open onhis way around the hill.

"That bastard crosses there every night," the man said. "Every night for two weeks."

"He's the one makes the noise at night. I don't mind it. They're a filthy animal though."

She was very good to him. He had been cruel and unjust in the afternoon.

She was a fine woman, marvellous really. And just then it occurred to him that he was going to die.

It came with a rush; not as a rush of water nor of wind;

but of a sudden, evil-smelling emptiness and the odd thing was that the hyena slipped lightly along the edge of it.

"What is it, Harry?" she asked him.

"Nothing," he said. "You had better move over to the other side. To windward."

"Did Molo change the dressing?""Yes. I'm just using the boric now."

"How do you feel?""A little wobbly."

"I'm going in to bathe," she said. "I'llbe right out. I'll eat with you and then we'll put the cot in."

So, he said to himself, we did well to stop the quarrelling.

He had never quarrelled much with this woman, while with the women that he loved he had quarrelled so much they had finally, always, with the corrosion of the quarrelling, killed what they had together.

### 背景知识

**💧****Call for Help in Danger**

**野外遇险求救**

我们了解到主人公Harry和Helen被困在非洲草原上，他们等待的救援飞机一直没有来。今天我们就一起来看一看野外遇险的情况下有哪些有效的求救方式吧～



\1. 烟火信号（Smoke Signal）

火光是非常有效的联络信号，遇险者可根据自身的实际情况，燃放火焰，请求助援。燃放三堆火焰，是国际上通行的求救信号，最好将火堆摆成三角形。若在白天，可以在火堆上添加散发烟雾的材料，比如苔藓、青嫩树枝、橡皮等物，使火焰产生浓烟，引起附近人的注意力；若在晚上，亮色浓烟十分醒目，可以多放些干柴，让火烧旺，火焰升高，其他任何潮湿的东西都产生烟雾。



\2. 地对空信号（Surface-to-Air Signal）

要记住国际通用的紧急求救信号字母，比如SOS、“FILL”。可以利用单个一根木棒“1”，这是最简便的搭配方式，也是最简单的一个制作。在制作过程中，每个信号的尺寸可以为长10米、宽3米，每个信号间隔3米。



\3. Body Signal

当搜索飞机靠近时，遇险者可用夸张的肢体语言表达求救的意思。因为夸张的肢体动作可以第一时间引起注意，并得到持续的关注。



\4. 旗语信号（Flag Signal）

一面旗子可以引起人们的注意力，若没有旗帜，可以将一块色泽亮艳的布料系在木棒上，引起援救者的注意力。牢记这样的持棒规律，先在在左侧长划，再在右侧短划，然后再加大动作的幅度，做出“8”字形运动。引起救援者的注意力。 



\5.  反光信号（Reflection Signal）

光线也是一个不错的求救信号，阳光和一个反射镜就能达到这样的效果。若没有镜子，任何明亮的材料都可利用，如罐头盒盖、一片金属铂片。环视天空的过程中，如果有飞机靠近，就快速反射出信号光。一旦确定自己已被发现，应立刻停止反射光线。



\6. 留下信息（Leave a Message）

遇险过程中，当离开危险地时，需要要留下一些地面信号物，以备让救援人员了解你的位置，一路上要不断留下指示标，可以让救援人员追寻而至，也可以让自己在返回途中不致迷路。

### 课文理解

作者本人（海明威）在Harry身上也投射了不少自己的经历和态度，比如对于身为作家这件事情，据说他自己曾经声称：政治、女人、酒精、金钱、野心都会毁掉一个作家（"politics, women, drink, money, and ambition" ruin writers）. 这一态度在今天的内容里也得到了鲜明的体现——

💧**Clue 1**: Harry thinks that women destroys his talent.

**Evidence 1**: She shot very well this good, this rich bitch, this kindly caretaker and destroyer of his talent.

她的枪法真好。这个有钱的女人。这个好心的女人。是她护卫了也毁掉了他的才能。



**Evidence 2**: It was strange, too, wasn't it, that when he fell in love with another woman, that woman should always have more money than the last one?

事情也真是蹊跷，不是吗，他爱上另一个女人，这个人总是比上一个更有钱。



按照Harry的说法，他是在出卖（traded on）自己的才能。自从依靠妻子过上安逸富足的生活之后，他“出卖了自己和信仰，酗酒无度，使自己的观察力退化，好吃懒做，邋里邋遢，恃才傲物，自视甚高，偏见甚重，还投机取巧，不择手段”。即便他对这种生活感到纠结和鄙夷，但他发现反而越是如此，他越是能吸引到有钱的女人为他倾心，他自己则任何真心都不用付出（it was strange that when he did not love her at all and was lying, that he should be able to give her more for her money than when he had really loved）.



有意思的是，对于他的妻子来说，他反而被她视为“一个作家、一个男子汉、一个伴侣、一个引以为豪的财产”（as a writer, as a man, as a companion and as a proud possession）. 今天的内容里也提到了他妻子的背景：她结过婚，也有过不少情人，也一度用酒精来麻痹痛苦；但自从其中一个孩子因飞机失事遇难后（Then one of her two children was killed in a plane crash）, 她就开始寻找新的人生。而Harry吸引她的地方就在于他有写作的天赋——



💧**Clue 2**: His wife respects him much for his talent.



**Evidence 1**: Suddenly, she had been acutely frightened of being alone. But she wanted some one that she respected with her.

突然之间，她有一种害怕孤独的恐惧。但是，她想找一个她心存尊敬的人一道生活。



**Evidence 2**: It had begun very simply. She liked what he wrote and she had always envied the life he led. She thought he did exactly what he wanted to.

事情来得并不复杂。她喜欢他写的东西，她一直羡慕他所过的那种生活。她觉得，他想到什么，就做什么。



因此在Harry看来，他和妻子的结合也是一桩各取所需的交易：The steps by which she had acquired him and the way in which she had finally fallen in love with him were all part of a regular progression in which she had built herself a new life and he had traded away what remained of his old life.（她为了得到他采取的种种步骤，以及最后与他相爱的那种方式，都是她为了营造新的生活而进行的常规进程的一部分，而他则出售他旧生活的残余时光。）



而在此之前，Harry并不是没有在两性关系中付出过感情，只是他的深情最终把关系给毁掉了（with the women that he loved he had quarrelled so much they had finally, always, with the corrosion of the quarrelling, killed what they had together）, 这也是他尽量避免和现在的妻子吵架的原因。明天内容的开头，我们会看到Harry再次闪回到过去，交代他是如何把自己的感情都消耗殆尽的。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****Camps**

**国外野营地**

在我们今天的内容当中我们了解到Harry和Helen来非洲狩猎旅行，自己搭建营地，体验一种野营的生活。（Now she came in sight, walking across the open toward the camp. She was wearing jodphurs and carrying her rifle. The two boys had a Tommie slung and they were coming along behind her. ）下面我们来一起了解一下在国外人们有着怎样的露营体验吧～



\1. 池塘小屋（Pond Cabin）

位于德国明斯特一小型私人花园里面的独特小屋，来自Baumraum设计和建造，在Baumraum的官网上，这幢小建筑被称为青蛙之王（king of the frogs），给你童话般的感受。

椭圆形的木质小屋依靠长长的金属高跷傲立于池塘上，与星球大战中的地形装甲运输步行者（AT-AT）外形颇为相似。里面配备了舒适的大床、现代家具和透明天窗，并有一个惬意的亲景阳台，休闲又舒适。



\2. 气泡帐篷（Bubble Tree）

由法国设计师Pierre Stephane Dumas设计，外观没有墙壁和屋顶，就是全透明的白色球状造型，是以可循环再造的塑胶制成，果真如泡泡一般，也有点象是巨大的金鱼缸一样，也像气球一样可以充气或放气，所以收纳十分方便，犹如一个可移动的旅馆房间。如果你比较“害羞”，不想完全暴露也没关系，这个系列帐篷里还有一款半透明式的，“泡泡”顶部完全向天空开放，四周则用墙裹起来，外面的人无法窥视内部。

幻想一下，晚上和心爱的人一起躺在床上，就能仰望神秘的星空，早上醒来，四面的风景一览无余，那是多么浪漫惬意的事。



\3. 蚕茧树蓬（Cocoon Tree Tent）

露营在户外，蚊虫蛇蝇大概会是最令人想拒之千里的噩梦之一，这时如果你有带上固然稍嫌笨重、但却能实际解决问题的蚕茧树篷，就好办多了。这一球形的移动树帐篷专为有树的户外环境设计 ，由防水油水覆盖在120公斤的铝球结构上，使用时用绳子将其挂在树上，就成了一个简易版的悬空树屋，防雨防水防蚊虫 ，并且内部圆床2.4米的直径完全可容纳两人舒适就卧。



\4.  水泥飞屋 （Cement Flying House）

西班牙建筑工作室ábaton特意打造了这样的“阿巴顿飞屋”，一栋高3.5米，面积27平米的移动式住宅。起重机吊起屋顶的两个钩环，它就几乎可以在任何地方驻扎了。客厅、厨房、卫生间、卧室，巨大的落地窗，房子虽然不大可是应有尽有。无论你旅行至何处，拉开窗帘，阳光、风景全都属于你，房间也变得通透敞亮。此外，木材的使用房屋增添了平衡性和舒适感，就看你有没有兴趣来体验现实版的“飞屋环游记”呢？



\5.  大堡礁露营村（ Great Barrier Reef Drew House）

在澳大利亚昆士兰州的一个小镇，设计师Simon Laws设计和建造了一座独特的度假屋drew house。它身处于清新的树林中，附近不远处就是风光秀丽的大堡礁海岸。为减少对自然环境的影响，组件在500公里外建造完成后才运输过来装配组装，其中包含了生活、 洗澡、 睡眠在内的两个分区，在不缺乏家的气息下，营造了一个豪华的野营氛围。

He thought about alone in Constantinople that time, having quarrelled in Paris before he had gone out.

He had whored the whole time and then, when that was over, and he had failed to kill his loneliness, but only made it worse,

he had written her, the first one, theone who left him, a letter telling her how he had never been able to kill it ...

How when he thought he saw her outside the Regence one time it made him go all faint and sick inside, and that he would follow a woman who looked like her in someway, along the Boulevard, afraid to see it was not she, afraid to lose the feeling it gave him.

How every one he had slept with had only made him miss her more.

How what she had done could never matter since he knew he could not cure himself of loving her.

He wrote this letter at the Club, coldsober, and mailed it to New York asking her to write him at the office in Paris.

That seemed safe. And that night missing her so much it made him feel hollow sick inside, he wanderedup past Maxim's, picked a girl up and took her out to supper.

He had gone to a place to dance with her afterward, she danced badly, and left her for a hot Armenian slut, that swung her belly against him so it almost scalded.

The gunner asked him outside and they fought in the street on the cobbles in the dark.

He'd hit him twice, hard, on the side of the jaw and when he didn't go down he knew he was in for a fight.

The gunner hit him in the body, then beside his eye.

He swung with his left again and landed and the gunner fell on him and grabbed his coat and tore the sleeve off

and he clubbed him twice behind the ear and then smashed him with his right as he pushed him away.

When the gunner went down his head hit first and he ran with the girl because they heard the M.P. 's coming.

They got into a taxi and drove out to Rimmily Hissa along the Bosphorus, and around, and back in the cool night and went to bed

and she felt as over-ripe as she looked but smooth, rose-petal, syrupy, smooth-bellied, big-breasted and needed no pillow under her buttocks,

and he left her before she was awake looking blousy enough in the first daylight and turned up at the Pera Palace with a black eye, carrying his coat because one sleeve was missing.

That same night he left for Anatolia and he remembered, later on that trip, riding all day through fields of the poppies that they raised for opium and how strange it made you feel,

> ==opium英 [ˈəʊpiəm] 美 [ˈoʊpiəm] n. 鸦片；麻醉剂==

> ==lumpily英 ['lʌmpɪlɪ] 美 ['lʌmpɪlɪ] adv. 多瘤地，波浪起伏地；多块地==

and he and the British observer had run too until his lungs ached and his mouth was full of the taste of pennies and they stopped behind some rocks and there were the Turks coming as lumpily as ever.

> <font color=red>...he and the British observer had run too until his lungs ached and his mouth was full of the taste of pennies...</font>

Later he had seen the things that he could never think of and later still he had seen much worse.

So when he got back to Paris that time he could not talk about it or stand to have it mentioned.

And there in the cafe as he passed was that American poet with a pile of saucers in front of him and a stupid look on his potato face talking about the Dada movement with a Roumanian who said his name was Tristan Tzara, who always wore a monocle and had a headache,

and, back at the apartment with his wife that now he loved again, the quarrel all over, the madness all over, glad to be home, the office sent his mail up to the flat.

So then the letter in answer to the one he'd written came in on a platter one morning and when he saw the hand writing he went cold all over and tried to slip the letter underneath another.

> ==platter英 [ˈplætə(r)] 美 [ˈplætɚ] n. 唱片；<美>大浅盘；不图回报地（给予）；拱手相让==

But his wife said, ''Who is that letter from, dear?'' and that was the end of the beginning of that.

He remembered the good times with them all, and the quarrels.

They always picked the finest places to have the quarrels.

And why had they always quarrelled when he was feeling best?

He had never written any of that because, at first, he never wanted to hurt any one and then it seemed as though there was enough to write without it.

But he had always thought that he would write it finally.

There was so much to write. He had seen the world change; not just the events;

although he had seen many of them and had watched the people, but he had seen the subtler change and he could remember how the people were at different times.

He had been in it and he had watched it and it was his duty to write of it; but now he never would.

"How do you feel?" she said. She had come out from the tent now after her bath.

"All right.""Could you eat now?"

He saw Molo behind her with the folding table and the other boy with the dishes.

"I want to write," he said.

"You ought to take some broth to keep your strength up."

"I'm going to die tonight," he said. "I don't need my strength up."

"Don't be melodramatic, Harry, please," she said.

"Why don't you use your nose? I'm rotted half way up my thigh now.

What the hell should I fool with broth for? Molo bring whiskey-soda."

"Please take the broth," she said gently.<br>"All right."

The broth was too hot. He had to hold it in the cup until it cooled enough to take it and then he just got it down without gagging.

"You're a fine woman," he said. "Don't pay any attention to me."

She looked at him with her well-known, well-loved face from Spur and Town & Country, only a little the worse for drink, only a little the worse for bed,

but Town & Country never showed those good breasts and those useful thighs and those lightly small-of-back-caressing hands,

and as he looked and saw her well-known pleasant smile, he felt death come again.

This time there was no rush. It was a puff, as of a wind that makes a candle flicker and the flame go tall.

"They can bring my net out later and hang it from the tree and build the fire up.

I'm not going in the tent tonight. It's not worth moving.

It's a clear night. There won't be any rain."

So this was how you died, in whispers that you did not hear.

Well, there would be no more quarrelling. He could promise that.

The one experience that he had never had he was not going to spoil now.

He probably would. He spoiled everything. But perhaps he wouldn't.

"You can't take dictation, can you?"

"I never learned," she told him.<br>"That's all right."

There wasn't time, of course, although it seemed as though it telescoped so that you might put it all into one paragraph if you could get it right.

A line of lombardy poplars ran from the house to the dock.

Other poplars ran along the point. Aroad went up to the hills along the edge of the timber and along that road he picked blackberries.

Then that log house was burned down and all the guns that had been on deer foot racks above the open fire place were burned and afterwards their barrels, with the lead melted in the magazines,

and the stocks burned away, lay outon the heap of ashes that were used to make lye for the big iron soap kettles,

and you asked Grandfather if you could have them to play with, and he said, no.

You see they were his guns still andhe never bought any others.

Nor did he hunt any more.

The house was rebuilt in the same place out of lumber now and painted white and from its porch you saw the poplars and the lake beyond; but there were never any more guns.

In the Black Forest, after the war, we rented a trout stream and there were two ways to walk to it.

One was down the valley from Triberg and around the valley road in the shade of the trees that bordered the white road,

and then up a side road that went up through the hills past many smallfarms, with the big Schwarzwald houses, until that road crossed the stream.

That was where our fishing began.

**君士坦丁堡**

\1. 君士坦丁堡的历史

我们今天的内容中提到了Harry回想的在君士坦丁堡的旧事（He thought about alone in Constantinople that time...），我们今天一起来了解一下君士坦丁堡吧～

君士坦丁堡是伊斯坦布尔的旧称，地处欧亚大陆交汇之处，地形为一个不规则的三角形半岛，地势高高矗立，三面环水坐拥天然屏障，易守难攻。斯塔夫理阿诺斯在《全球通史》中说道：“没有一个西方国家的首都，在帝国统治的连续性和范围方面，能与拜占庭首都君士坦丁堡的辉煌历史相媲美。”

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/12ee3c820d7e63b8a0a1d5f94d8715e2-sz_886160.png)



君士坦丁堡是古希腊的移民城市，称拜占庭，公元前660年为希腊人所建。罗马帝国皇帝君士坦丁大帝重建并扩建了拜占庭，并于公元330年宣布迁都拜占庭，改名为君士坦丁堡，意谓“君士坦丁之城”，别称“新罗马”。从此，这个城市开始了它辉煌的千年历史，君士坦丁的名字与这个城市溶为一体，直到1453年。



公元395年，东西罗马帝国正式分裂，君士坦丁堡作为东罗马帝国（拜占庭帝国）首都，成为地中海东部政治、经济、文化中心。在1204年第四次十字军东征劫掠了君士坦丁堡。君士坦丁堡1453年4月初又遭到土耳其军队的围困，5月29日穆罕默德二世的军队攻入城内，君士坦丁堡陷落，拜占庭帝国（东罗马帝国）灭亡。

12-13世纪身穿扎甲的拜占庭士兵

君士坦丁堡为奥斯曼帝国占领，并成为奥斯曼帝国首都，更名为伊斯坦布尔。当罗马灭亡的时候，拜占庭王朝依然强大如初，并且在此后1000多年的岁月里，一直都是世界上最繁荣的文明之一。对于那些深受异族侵略者威胁、依靠拜占庭王朝才能生存的小国来说，它就像是一座海上的灯塔，闪耀着不灭的光芒。



\2. 伊斯坦布尔景点推荐

蓝色清真寺是伊斯坦布尔最具代表性的大清真寺，其260个小窗、2万多块蓝色磁砖、数百块地毯和众多阿拉伯书法艺术作品是该寺的重要看点。

圣索菲亚大教堂与蓝色清真寺隔街相望，早期是拜占庭帝国的主教堂，后被土耳其人占领后改建成为清真寺，现为博物馆。这是一座土耳其著名的历史建筑，也是土耳其的象征之一。



\3. 图书推荐:《君士坦丁堡最后之恋》

本书的作者米洛拉德·帕维奇，曾几度被诺贝尔文学奖提名，最终却遗憾无缘该奖，因此被人称为“无冕之王”。在这本小说里，他玩出了新花样：除了小说以外，随书附赠的还有一套塔罗牌，它们是通往这间文学王国的一把钥匙。

### 课文理解

今天的开头是Harry回忆起自己曾经有一次和妻子吵架后，一气之下从巴黎跑到了君士坦丁堡（He thought about alone in Constantinople that time, having quarrelled in Paris before he had gone out）. 那段时间他放任自己流连在娼妓之间，还写信给了曾经的初恋情人，告诉对方自己怎样在她离开后总是感觉患得患失，没有办法消除寂寞感（he had written her, the first one, the one who left him, a letter telling her how he had never been able to kill it）——



💧**Clue 1**: Harry was at a loss after his first lover left him.



**Evidence 1**: He had whored the whole time and then, when that was over, and he had failed to kill his loneliness, but only made it worse...

那一阵他夜夜宿娼，事后寂寞依然无法排遣，反而变得更糟……



**Evidence 2**: How when he thought he saw her outside the Regence one time it made him go all faint and sick inside, and that he would follow a woman who looked like her in some way, along the Boulevard, afraid to see it was not she, afraid to lose the feeling it gave him.

他告诉她，有一次在摄政院外，他以为看到了她，竟感到晕头转向，心里难受不已。他告诉她，在林荫大道，他总会跟踪外表有点像她的女人，可就是不敢去证实不是她，生怕就此失去这样的跟踪带给他的美好感觉。



Harry还在给初恋情人的信中，还告知对方把回信寄到自己在巴黎的事务所。但是当他回到巴黎后看到事务所转来的信，为了不在妻子面前败露，便赶紧藏了起来，之后也就不了了之了（...he went cold all over and tried to slip the letter underneath another. But his wife said, ''Who is that letter from, dear?'' and that was the end of the beginning of that）.



回到现实里，Harry依然无法摆脱死亡即将来临的焦虑和恐惧——



💧**Clue 2**: Harry is still huanted by the coming of death.



**Evidence 1**: ...he felt death come again.This time there was no rush. It was a puff, as of a wind that makes a candle flicker and the flame go tall.

……他再次感到了死神的降临。这一次不是冲击，而是呼出的一口气，就像那使得烛光摇曳、火苗上蹿的一阵微风。



**Evidence 2**:  So this was how you died, in whispers that you did not hear. Well, there would be no more quarrelling.

看来这就是你辞别人世的方式了，在肉耳听不见的飒飒声中。这样也好，不再会有争吵了。



这时候Harry想到的是妻子或许能帮自己记录口授，这样他就可以把脑子里的东西都写下来了，但妻子并不会（"You can't take dictation, can you?" "I never learned," she told him. "That's all right." ）于是他便开始继续进行心理创作（There was a log house, chinked white with mortar...）

The husband of the woman who ran the Bal Musette drove a taxi and when he, Harry, had to take an early plane the husband knocked upon the door to wake him and they each drank a glass of white wine at the zinc of the bar before they started.

He knew his neighbors in that quarter then because they all were poor.

And in that poverty, and in that quarter across the street from a Boucherie Chevaline([法]马肉铺) and a wine cooperative he had written the start of all he was to do.

There never was another part of Paris that he loved like that, the sprawling trees, the old white plastered houses painted brown below, the long green of the autobus in that round square,

> ==sprawling英 [ˈsprɔ:lɪŋ] 美 [ˈsprɔlɪŋ] adj. 蔓延的；杂乱无序伸展的==

the purple flower dye upon the paving, the sudden drop down the hill of the rue Cardinal Lemoine(勒穆瓦纳红衣大主教街) to the River, and the other way the narrow crowded world of the rue Mouffetard(莫菲塔德街).

The street that ran up toward the Pantheon and the other that he always took with the bicycle, the only asphalted street in all that quarter, smooth under the tires, withthe high narrow houses and the cheap tall hotel where Paul Verlainehad died.

There were only two rooms in the apartments where they lived and he had a room on the top floor of that hotel that cost him sixty francs a month where he did his writing,

and from it he could see the roofs and chimney pots and all the hills ofParis.

From the apartment you could only see the wood and coal man's place.

He sold wine too, bad wine.

The golden horse's head outside theBoucherie Chevaline where the carcasses hung yellow gold and red in the open window,

and the green painted co-operative where they bought their wine; good wine and cheap.

The rest was plaster walls and the windows of the neighbors.

The neighbors who, at night, when some one lay drunk in the street, moaning and groaning in that typical French ivresse that you were propaganded to believe did not exist, would open their windows and then the murmur of talk.

"Where is the policeman? When you don't want him the bugger is always there. He's sleeping with some concierge. Get the Agent. "

Till some one threw a bucket of water from a window and the moaning stopped.

"What's that? Water. Ah, that's intelligent." And the windows shutting.

Marie, his femme de menage, protesting against the eight-hour daysaying,

"If a husband works until six he gets only a riffle drunk on the way home and does not waste too much.

If he works only until five he is drunk every night and one has no money.

It is the wife of the working man who suffers from this shortening of hours."

"Wouldn't you like some more broth?" the woman asked him now.

"No, thank you very much. It is awfully good."

"Try just a little." "I would like a whiskey-soda." "It's not good for you."

"No. It's bad for me. Cole Porter wrote the words and the music. This knowledge that you're going mad for me."

"You know I like you to drink.""Oh yes. Only it's bad for me."

When she goes, he thought, I'll have all I want.

Not all I want but all there is. Ayee he was tired. Too tired.

He was going to sleep a little while. He lay still and death was not there.

It must have gone around another street.

It went in pairs, on bicycles, and moved absolutely silently on the pavements.

No, he had never written about Paris. Not the Paris that he cared about.

But what about the rest that he had never written?

What about the ranch and the silvered gray of the sage brush, the quick, clear water in the irrigation ditches, and the heavy green of the alfalfa.

> ==irrigation英 [ˌɪrɪ'ɡeɪʃn] 美 [ˌɪrɪ'ɡeɪʃn] n. 灌溉；水利；[医]冲洗；冲注洗剂==

The trail went up into the hills and the cattle in the summer were shy as deer.

The bawling and the steady noise and slow moving mass raising a dust as you brought them down in the fall.

And behind the mountains, the clearsharpness of the peak in the evening light and, riding down alongthe trail in the moonlight, bright across the valley.

Now he remembered coming down through the timber in the dark holding the horse's tail when you could not see and all the stories that he meant to write.

About the half-wit chore boy who was left at the ranch that time and told not to let any one get any hay,

and that old bastard from the Forks who had beaten the boy when he had worked for him stopping to get some feed.

> ==chore英 [tʃɔ:(r)] 美 [tʃɔ:r] n. 零星工作（尤指家常杂务）；令人讨厌的或繁重的工作==

>
> ②...and that old bastard from the Forks / who had beaten the boy when he had worked for him / stopping to get some feed.
>
> and that old bastard from the Forks中的that是指示代词，who had beaten the boy作定语从句修饰the old bastard, when he had worked for him要注意指代问题，he是the old bastard, him是the boy; stopping to get some feed作the old bastard的后置定语。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> the half-wit chore boy “那个打杂的愣头青”；wit作名词表示“机智，颖悟力”（the ability to think quickly and make the right decisions），所以half-wit指“傻瓜，笨蛋”（sb who behaves in a stupid, silly, or irresponsible way）; chore表示“杂务，琐事”，chore boy也就是“打杂的男孩”。

The boy refusing and the old man saying he would beat him again.

The boy got the rifle from the kitchen and shot him when he tried to come into the barn and when they came back to the ranch he'd been dead a week, frozen in the corral, and the dogs had eaten part of him.

But what was left you packed on a sled wrapped in a blanket and roped on and you got the boy to help you haul it,

and the two of you took it out over the road on skis, and sixty miles down to town to turn the boy over.

He having no idea that he would be arrested.

Thinking he had done his duty and that you were his friend and he would be rewarded.

He'd helped to haul the old man in so everybody could know how bad the old man had been and how he'dtried to steal some feed that didn't belong to him,

and when the sheriff put the handcuffs on the boy he couldn't believe it.

Then he'd started to cry. That was one story he had saved to write.

He knew at least twenty good stories from out there and he had never written one. Why?

"You tell them why," he said. "Why what, dear?" "Why nothing."

She didn't drink so much, now, since she had him.

But if he lived he would never write about her, he knew that now.

Nor about any of them. The rich were dull and they drank too much, or they played too much backgammon.

They were dull and they were repetitious.

> ==repetitious英 [ˌrepəˈtɪʃəs] 美 [ˌrɛpɪˈtɪʃəs] adj. 重复的，反复的==

He remembered poor Julian and hisromantic awe of them and how he had started a story once that began,"The very rich are different from you and me."

And how some one had said to Julian, Yes, they have more money.

But that was not humorous to Julian.

He thought they were a special glamourous race and when he found they weren't it wrecked him just as much as any other thing thatwrecked him.

He had been contemptuous of those who wrecked.

You did not have to like it because you understood it.

He could beat anything, he thought, because no thing could hurt him if he did not care.

All right. Now he would not care for death. One thing he had always dreaded was the pain.

He could stand pain as well as any man, until it went on too long, and wore him out, but here he had something that had hurt frightfully and just when he had felt it breaking him, the pain had stopped.

巴黎公社是一个在1871年3月18日到5月28日期间短暂地统治巴黎的政府。巴黎工人团结起来推翻现存的法国政权，因其未能保护这座城市不受普鲁士的围攻，从而形成了该市和整个法国的第一个真正民主的政府。

1870年9月4日，巴黎爆发革命，宣布成立第三共和国。由资产阶级共和派和奥尔良派分子组成的新政府，称为“国防政府”。普鲁士并不满足于皇帝的投降，继续大举进攻法国。9月19日，普军包围巴黎。多年来不断加剧的贫富分化，再加上当前的食物短缺，军队失败，还有普鲁士军队的不断炮轰终于大大激化了社会各界的不满情绪。巴黎市民，特别是工人阶级和下层中产阶级一直以来都希望能建立一个民主共和国。

1871年3月18日凌晨，政府军企图夺取巴黎市内的蒙马特尔高地和梭蒙高地时，被人发现。巴黎人民奋起反击，当晚就占领了城内的战略要地，临时政府总理梯也尔狼狈逃出巴黎，迁往凡尔赛。不久，巴黎公社成立，它是第一个无产阶级政权的雏形。

5月23日，政府军通过普鲁士军队的防线攻陷蒙马特尔高地。当天晚上面临失败的公社政权下令纵火烧毁巴黎。在当天和次日被烧毁的建筑包括波旁王朝和第二帝国的王宫杜伊勒里宫和与其相连的卢浮宫、法国参议院、内政部、财政部、司法部、王宫（Le Palais Royal）、巴黎市政厅、圣马丁门歌剧院，同时开始枪杀人质。

最顽强的抵抗发生在东部的工人阶级区，战斗一直持续，直到流血周最后的巷战。到了当年5月27日，只有极少数的抵抗仍在持续，特别是最贫困的东部地区，如Belleville和Ménilmontant。当年战斗到5月28日下午或晚间全部结束。数万人被军队俘虏，其中许多人被处决。在“血腥的一周”中被杀害的人和被囚犯被处死的人被埋葬在城市周围无标记的坟墓中，公墓大屠杀的其中一个地方是在出名的拉雪兹神父公墓，那里现在存在纪念被杀的人。

### 课文理解

今天的内容开头依然是Harry的记忆闪回（昨天的结尾部分提到了他祖父的原木房子还有德国的黑森林），其中有一大段关于巴黎的描写，言语措辞之间充满明亮，这里也象征着他的青春、快乐，以及充满潜能和希望的时光——

💧**Clue 1**: His memory of Paris represents his youth, happiness, and potential.



**Evidence 1**: You could dictate that, but you could not dictate the Place Contrescarpe where the flower sellers dyed their flowers in the street and the dye ran over the paving...

这个你可以口授，但你口授不了康特斯卡普广场，花贩在大街上染花，染液一直流到了人行道上……



**Evidence 2**: There never was another part of Paris that he loved like that, the sprawling trees, the old white plastered houses painted brown below, the long green of the autobus in that round square, the purple flower dye upon the paving, the sudden drop down the hill of the rue Cardinal Lemoine to the River, and the other way the narrow crowded world of the rue Mouffetard.

巴黎再没有另一个让他如此喜爱的地方了，这里树木蔓生，白灰泥墙老房子的下半截被刷成了棕色，圆形广场上长长的绿色公交车，人行道上紫色的染色液，依山而下、直通塞纳河的勒穆瓦纳红衣大主教街，而拥挤狭窄的莫菲塔德街则是另一番景象。



还需要注意的一个细节是，虽然Harry对死亡既焦虑又恐惧，但他对于妻子的照顾和叮嘱丝毫不放在心上，他一刻也不停地在喝酒——



💧**Clue 2**: Harry wouldn't stopped drinking.



**Evidence 1**: "Wouldn't you like some more broth?" the woman asked him now.

"No, thank you very much. It is awfully good."

"Try just a little."

"I would like a whiskey-soda."

“不再喝点肉汤吗？”女人此刻问他。

“不要了，多谢你。这味道真好。”

“再喝一点儿吧。”

“我想喝威士忌苏打。”



**Evidence 2**:  Too tired. He was going to sleep a little while. He lay still and death was not there. It must have gone around another street. It went in pairs, on bicycles, and moved absolutely silently on the pavements.

太累了。他想睡一会儿。他静静地躺着，死神不在身边，一定是到了另一条街上。死神成双结对，骑着自行车，悄无声息地行使在人行道上。



在今天内容的结尾，Harry提到自己曾经最害怕的是疼痛（One thing he had always dreaded was the pain.）但是现在有一件更让他无法忍受的事情（but here he had something that had hurt frightfully and just when he had felt it breaking him, the pain had stopped）, 这件事情是什么呢？我们一起期待明天的情节进展~

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****Horsemeat**

**西方人对马肉的好恶**



在我们今天的内容中有这样的描写：The golden horse's head outside the Boucherie Chevaline where the carcasses hung yellow gold and red in the open window.（马肉铺子外面挂着金黄色的马头，在马肉铺的橱窗里挂着金黄色和红色的马肉。）法国人钟情于马肉，而英美等国却对马肉嗤之以鼻，不同国家对马肉的态度有很大差异，我们今天就一起来了解一下吧～

\1. 法国人爱吃马肉

在巴黎的街头巷尾的马肉铺门外，排成长队的人们挑选各自喜爱的部位，带回家去用油、柠檬汁和胡椒烹制。吃马肉的传统可以追溯到拿破仑时代。据记载，这一传统起源于19世纪初法俄两军在波兰激烈对垒，在弹尽粮绝时只得杀马充饥。马肉还帮助法国人度过了第二次世界大战后经济萧条的那些艰难岁月。如今法国的食客们仍保持着对马肉的忠诚，面包马脑、煎马心、马排都是法国厨房里的经典菜肴。

在欧洲，马都是用纯天然草料饲养的，因此马肉有利于人体吸收。不少法国人认为，马肉营养价值高，脂肪少、易烹饪，铁元素和蛋白质含量丰富，对治疗贫血效果很好，在法国经常被医生当作药膳推荐给妇女、青少年和运动员。

一些马肉美食家还联手办起一家网店，叫“我的马肉店”，不仅交流马的信息及马肉烹饪知识，还销售马肉，甚至提供送马肉上门的服务。吃马肉也从贫穷和绝望的象征变为品质的享受。在巴黎的一些知名餐馆，大厨们又恢复了马肉美味菜肴的制作，吸引了众多外国游客前来品尝。



\2. 英美人不吃马肉

英国拒绝马肉，或许是因为幅员辽阔的大英帝国有足够的红肉——猪牛羊鹿兔——可吃。2013年，英国人发现他们购买的牛肉制品中含有马肉而难以抑制怒火，出现了“马肉风波”。美国人即使在食物供应短缺的时候也不把刀叉指向他们的驮兽朋友，这也许是因为美国人和马从开拓时代起就建立起了深厚关系，以至于在20世纪的食物大短缺时代，吃马肉近乎是不道德的。 

《旧约·利未记》中禁止食用马肉。逃亡美洲的清教徒将基督教的饮食禁忌带到新大陆，美国人最开始也不吃马肉。除了宗教原因，北美大陆物产丰富，广袤的牧场提供足够多的饮食选择。9世纪的美国报纸满是对旧大陆残忍食马肉行为的报道。



由于吃马肉总与不愉快的主题（贫穷和丧失原则）相连，“马肉”一词演变成一种政治嘲讽的手段。在1948年的食物短缺中，杜鲁门总统被反对党讥讽为“马肉哈里”。

But that night he was caught in the wire, with a flare lighting him up and his bowels spilled out into the wire,

so when they brought him in, alive, they had to cut him loose.

Shoot me, Harry. For Christ sake shoot me.

They had had an argument one time about our Lord never sending you anything you could not bear

Except that he would rather be in better company.

He thought a little about the company that he would like to have.

No, he thought, when everything you do, you do too long, and do too late, you can't expect to find the people still there.

The people all are gone. The party'sover and you are with your hostess now.

I'm getting as bored with dying as with everything else, he thought.

"It's a bore," he said out loud.

"What is, my dear?"Anything you dotoo bloody long."

He looked at her face between him and the fire. She was leaning back in the chair and the firelight shone on her pleasantly lined face and he could see that she was sleepy.

He heard the hyena make a noise just outside the range of the fire.

"I've been writing," he said. "But I got tired."

"Do you think you will be able to sleep?"

"Pretty sure. Why don't you turn in?"

"I like to sit here with you."

"Do you feel anything strange?" he asked her.

"No. Just a little sleepy."I do," he said.

He had just felt death come by again.

"You know the only thing I've never lost is curiosity," he said to her.

"You've never lost anything. You're the most complete man I've ever known."

Because, just then, death had come and rested its head on the foot of the cot and he could smell its breath.

"Never believe any of that about a scythe and a skull," he told her.

"It can be two bicycle policemen as easily, or be a bird. Or it can have a wide snout like a hyena."

> hyena（鬣狗），体型似犬，长颈，后肢较前肢短弱，躯体较短，肩高而臀低。棕鬣狗体型较大，分布于非洲西南部海岸，常到海滩寻食螃蟹、鱼等。而斑鬣狗仅见于非洲，体型较大，成群猎食，除食腐肉外，能猎捕羚羊。土狼为特化的食蚁动物。

It had moved up on him now, but it had no shape any more. It simply occupied space.

"Tell it to go away." It did not go away but moved a little closer.

"You've got a hell of a breath," he told it. "You stinking bastard."

It moved up closer to him still and now he could not speak to it, and when it saw he could not speak it came a little closer,

and now he tried to send it away without speaking, but it moved in on him so its weight was all upon his chest

and while it crouched there and he could not move or speak, he heard the woman say, "Bwana is asleep now. Take the cot up very gently and carry it into the tent."

He could not speak to tell her to make it go away and it crouched now, heavier, so he could not breathe.

And then, while they lifted the cot, suddenly it was all right and the weight went from his chest.

It was morning and had been morning for some time and he heard the plane.

It showed very tiny and then made a wide circle and the boys ran out and lit the fires, using kerosene,

and piled on grass so there were two big smudges at each end of thelevel place and the morning breeze blew them toward the camp and theplane circled twice more,

low this time, and then glided down and levelled off and landed smoothly and,

coming walking toward him, was oldCompton in slacks, a tweed jacket and a brown felt hat.

"What's the matter, old cock?" Compton said.

"Bad leg," he told him. "Will you have some breakfast?"

"Thanks. I'll just have some tea. It's the Puss Moth you know.

I won't be able to take the Memsahib. There's only room for one. Your lorry is on the way."

Helen had taken Compton aside and was speaking to him. Compton came back more cheery than ever.

"We'll get you right in," he said. "I'll be back for the Mem. Now I'm afraid I'll have to stop at Arusha to refuel. We'd better get going."

"What about the tea?"I don't really care about it, you know."

The boys had picked up the cot and carried it around the green tents and down along the rock and out onto the plain and along past the smudges that were burning brightly now,

the grass all consumed, and the wind fanning the fire, to the little plane.

It was difficult getting him in, but once in he lay back in the leather seat, and the leg was stuck straight out to one side of the seat where Compton sat.

Compton started the motor and got in. He waved to Helen and to the boys and, as the clatter moved into the old familiar roar,

> ==clatter英 [ˈklætə(r)] 美 [ˈklætɚ] vt.& vi. 发出咔哒声；嘁嘁喳喳地说笑；使卡搭卡搭的响 n. 哗啦声；嘁嘁喳喳的谈笑声；咔哒声==

they swung around with Compie watching for warthog holes and roared, bumping,

along the stretch between the fires and with the last bump rose and he saw them all standing below, waving,

and the camp beside the hill, flattening now, and the plain spreading, clumps of trees, and the bush flattening,

while the game trails ran now smoothly to the dry waterholes, and there was a new water that he had never known of.

The zebra, small rounded backs now, and the wildebeeste, big-headed dots seeming to climb as they moved in long fingers across the plain,

now scattering as the shadow came toward them, they were tiny now, and the movement had no gallop,

and the plain as far as you could see, gray-yellow now and ahead oldCompie's tweed back and the brownfelt hat.

Then they were over the first hills and the wildebeeste were trailing upthem, and then they were over mountains with sudden depths of green-rising forest and the solid bamboo slopes,

> <font color=red>Then they were over the first hills / and the wildebeeste were trailing up them, / and then they were over mountains with sudden depths of green-rising forest / and the solid bamboo slopes...</font>

> ②with sudden depths of green-rising forest“生长着绿色参天大树的山峰”；depths of在这里可以理解为“大片的”（a vast space of）.
>
> ③the solid bamboo slopes “生长着茂密竹林的山坡”；solid表示“连绵的，茂密的”（continuous; thick, dense）. 

and then the heavy forest again, sculptured into peaks and hollows until they crossed, and hills sloped down and then another plain, hot now, and purple brown, bumpy with heat and Compie looking back to see how he was riding.

> <font color=red> ...and then the heavy forest again, /sculptured into peaks and hollows / until they crossed, / and hills sloped down and then another plain, / hot now, and purple brown, /bumpy with heat / and Compie looking back to see / how he was riding.</font>

Then there were other mountains dark ahead.

And then instead of going on to Arusha they turned left, he evidently figured that they had the gas, and looking down he saw a pink sifting cloud, moving over the ground,

and in the air, like the first snow in at a blizzard, that comes from nowhere, and he knew the locusts were coming, up from the South.

> ==blizzard英 [ˈblɪzəd] 美 [ˈblɪzərd] n. 暴风雪；大量==

> ==locust英 [ˈləʊkəst] 美 [ˈloʊkəst] n. 蝗虫，蚱蜢；[植]角豆树；[植]洋槐；破坏者==

Then they began to climb and they were going to the East it seemed, and then it darkened and they were in a storm, the rain so thick it seemed like flying through a waterfall,

and then they were out and Compieturned his head and grinned and pointed and there, ahead, all he could see, as wide as all the world, great, high, and unbelievably white in the sun, was the square top of Kilimanjaro.

And then he knew that there was where he was going.Just then the hyena stopped whimpering in the night and started to make a strange,human, almost crying sound.

> ==whimper英 [ˈwɪmpə(r)] 美 [ˈhwɪmpɚ, ˈwɪm-] vi. 啜泣，呜咽；抱怨 vt. 啜泣或呜咽着说 n. 啜泣声，呜咽声；怨声==

The woman heard it and, stirred uneasily. She did not wake.

In her dream she was at the house on Long Island and it was the night before her daughter's debut.

> ==debut英 ['deɪbju:] 美 [deˈbju, ˈdeˌbju] n. 初次露面，初次表演，首次出场，处女秀 v. 初次表演，初次登台 adj. 首张的，首场的，首次的==

Somehow her father was there and he had been very rude.

Then the noise the hyena made was so loud she woke and for a moment she did not know where she was and she was very afraid.

Then she took the flashlight and shone it on the other cot that they had carried in after Harry had gone to sleep.

She could see his bulk under the mosquito bar but somehow he had gotten his leg out and it hung down alongside the cot.

The dressings had all come down and she could not look at it.

"Molo," she called, "Molo! Molo!"

Then she said, "Harry, Harry!" Then her voice rising, "Harry! Please. Oh Harry!"

There was no answer and she could not hear him breathing.

Outside the tent the hyena made the same strange noise that had awakened her.

But she did not hear him for the beating of her heart.

### 背景知识

**💧****The Symbols in The Snows of Kilimanjaro**

**小说中意象的象征含义**

今天是我们这篇小说学习的最后一天，今天要给大家分析一下小说中出现的意象有哪些象征含义～



\1. 坏疽：肉体与精神的双重腐败

原文：Since the gangrene started in his right leg he had no pain and with the pain the horror had gone and all he felt now was a great tiredness and anger that this was the end of it.（自从他的右腿开始生坏疽以来，他就不觉得痛，随着疼痛的消失，恐惧也消失了，他现在感到的只是一种强烈的厌倦和愤怒：这居然就是结局。）

小说中男主人公Harry因左腿被荆棘刺破后未能及时医治而感染了坏疽，最终导致了死亡。Harry左腿的坏疽开始于非洲之行，但其精神上的“坏疽”早就已经蔓延。Harry本是一位作家，在经历了诸多挫折与磨难之后放弃了对爱以及写作的追求，“坏疽”的长期存在导致了Harry精神的腐败。他的懒惰、势利与傲慢毁灭了自己的创作才能。

他与妻子Helen来到非洲狩猎就是为了重拾创作的激情，医治精神上的“坏疽”。在Harry纵情酒色之中的时候，精神的“坏疽”就已经一发不可收拾，哈利废弃了自己的写作才华和对写作的追寻，沉醉在纸醉金迷之中，而富有的妻子Helen也成为了Harry精神上“坏疽”蔓延的催化剂。实际Harry腿上的坏疽是其精神“坏疽”的象征性显现，而二者结合最终夺去了Harry的肉体和灵魂。



\2. 鬣狗和秃鹰：死亡的迫近与物质的寄生

原文：... but of a sudden, evil-smelling emptiness and the odd thing was that the hyena slipped lightly along the edge of it.（而是一股无影无踪的臭气的冲击，令人奇怪的是，那只鬣狗却沿着这股无影无踪的臭气的边缘轻轻地溜过了。）

Harry左腿的坏疽散发出腐肉的气息，吸引着只食腐肉的鬣狗和秃鹰。鬣狗和秃鹰的这种习性使得二者成为了象征死亡的重要意象，它们始终与死亡和黑暗相联系。鬣狗和秃鹰出现“在天色渐暗之时，它们寻着Harry左腿上腐肉所散发的腐败气味徘徊在哈利的周遭，使人感觉到仿佛死亡也在一点一点逼近”。

而鬣狗和秃鹰的生活习性又是Harry生活的写照：哈利就像终日食腐肉的鬣狗和秃鹰一样，在寄生中生存，空有写作的才华却完全放弃了自我对写作的追寻。Helen是个富有的女人，在与妻子的生活中，Harry是个彻头彻尾的寄生者。他巧言令色、满嘴谎言，出卖自己换取Helen在物质上的无限供应。



\3. 雪山猎豹：追寻的精神永生 

原文：Kilimanjaro is a snow covered mountain 19,710 feet high, and it is said to be the highest mountain in Africa.（乞力马扎罗是一座海拔一万九千七百一十英尺的长年积雪的高山，据说它是非洲最高的一座山。）

Close to the western summit there is the dried and frozen carcass of a leopard. No one has explained what the leopard was seeking at that altitude. （在西高峰的近旁，有一具已经风干冻僵的豹子的尸体。豹子到这样高寒的地方来寻找什么，没有人作过解释。）

小说开始是一段景物描写，乍看起来颇令人费解，但细细咀嚼完故事的高潮，即Harry灵魂飞升的过程后，再回过头来品味这一段，才使人真正步入海明威创造的神奇的意境之中。猎豹是海明威极为喜爱甚至崇拜的动物。他曾在《非洲的青山》（*The Green Hills of Africa*）中通过人与豹耐力与智力的较量，对豹做过人格化和描叙。

在这段描写中，海明威只是写了雪山与猎豹。以雪山之巅的死豹意象作为开头给出了一个谜：豹子为什么要到这么高的雪山上来？为了追寻什么：为了食物，或是因为某种神秘的冲动？生命虽然终结，但因冻僵，尸体得以风干保存，这意味着什么？小说没有给出答案，设置了悬念。

### 课文理解

在最后的闪回中，Harry想起了过去在战争中，一个投弹官被手榴弹击中，最后痛不欲生的场景（He remembered long ago when Williamson, the bombing officer, had been hit by a stick bomb some one in a German patrol had thrown as he was coming in through the wire that night and, screaming, had begged every one to kill him.）接着他回到现实里，对于现在的他来说，疼痛已经不算什么了，他唯一遗憾的是身边没有一个称心的伴侣，即便是Helen也无法让他满意——

💧**Clue 1**: Harry is not satisfied with Helen's company.

**Evidence 1**: Still this now, that he had, was very easy; and if it was no worse as it went on there was nothing to worry about. Except that he would rather be in better company.

现在，他身上的疼痛并不难忍受，只要它不再恶化，就没有什么好担心的。  他只是希望自己能有一个好一点儿的伴儿。

**Evidence 2**: "You know the only thing I've never lost is curiosity," he said to her.

"You've never lost anything. You're the most complete man I've ever known."

"Christ," he said. "How little a woman knows. What is that? Your intuition?"

“你知道，我唯一没有失去的东西，就是好奇心。”他对她说。

“你什么都没有失去。你是我知道的最完美的男人。”

“上帝啊。”他说，“女人真是见识短。那是什么？你的直觉？”



Harry不断地感觉死神在向他逼近（It had moved up on him now, but it had no shape any more. It simply occupied space.）在他清醒的最后时刻，他听到Helen吩咐仆人把他轻轻抬进帐篷里去（he heard the woman say, "Bwana is asleep now. Take the cot up very gently and carry it into the tent."）接着Harry再次进入潜意识中，这一次，他梦见自己在第二天早晨等到了救援飞机，但是这架飞机没有按照原定计划去加油，或是飞向附近的城镇，它飞去的是乞力马扎罗的山顶——



💧**Clue 2**: Before Harry dies, he dreamt of being on a plane and flying to the top of Kilimanjaro.



**Evidence 1**: Compie turned his head and grinned and pointed and there, ahead, all he could see, as wide as all the world, great, high, and unbelievably white in the sun, was the square top of Kilimanjaro. And then he knew that there was where he was going.

康毕转过头来，对他咧嘴一笑，用手指了指，前方，他目所能及的像整个世界一样壮阔，雄伟高耸，在阳光下白得令人难以置信的，正是乞力马扎罗山方形的山顶。他于是明白了，那就是他要去的地方。



**Evidence 2**: Just then the hyena stopped whimpering in the night and started to make a strange, human, almost crying sound. The woman heard it and, stirred uneasily. She did not wake.

就这时候，鬣狗在夜色中停止了悲嚎，它开始发出一种奇怪的、几乎像人的哭声那样的叫喊声。女人被这个声音搅得心神不宁，但她并没有醒来。



乞力马扎罗的山顶一直被称为“上帝的居所”（the House of God）, 因此Harry在临死之际想象自己飞向了乞力马扎罗的山顶也可以理解为一种对“在精神世界安息”的渴望。在现实中他并未能完全实现自己的理想，而是终日在安逸享乐之中（尤其是遇上了Helen这样可以供他吃穿的妻子）。意外受伤以及濒临死亡的体验让他开始深刻地思考这个问题，但最终矛盾依旧没有在现实中得到解决，而是以迂回的方式，在他的潜意识里画上了句号。

**💧****战争小说推荐**

**War Novels**

在我们今天的内容当中出现了一个投弹军官被一名德国巡逻兵扔过来的一枚手榴弹打中之后的血腥场面（when Williamson, the bombing officer, had been hit by a stick bomb some one in a German patrol had thrown as he was coming in through the wire that night and, screaming, had begged every one to kill him. ）

海明威参加过两次世界大战、第二次希腊土耳其战争和西班牙内战，因此在他的小说中出现过很多战争场面。今天我们给大家推荐几部战争题材的小说，有的作家描写战争暴露而血腥，有的作家隐忍而克制，我们来一起了解一下吧～



\1. 《红色英勇勋章》(The Red Badge of Courage) 斯蒂芬·克莱恩（Stephen Crane）

小说以美国南北战争（1861-1865）为历史背景。主人公亨利是一个农妇的独子。他怀着对战争的奇妙幻想，渴望过军队生活，不顾母亲的劝阻，参加了北方军。激烈的战斗场面虽然对他有刺激性的引诱，但死亡的威胁在他心里发生着强烈的动摇作用。战场上的炮声解除了他的矛盾心理，亨利勇敢地投入了战斗，但当遭到敌人突然袭击时，他惊恐万状，扔下枪枝，从阵地上逃跑了。

当他听到北方军重又获胜的消息时，他不幸被从火线上溃退下来的一个士兵用枪托打伤了脑袋。伙伴们见亨利负了伤，不仅不怀疑他是逃兵，反而敬佩他那种轻伤不下火线的勇敢精神。可是亨利万分羞愧，暗暗下决心寻找立功机会。

\2. 《第22条军规》（Catch-22）约瑟夫·海勒（Joseph Heller）

该小说以第二次世界大战为背景，通过对驻扎在地中海一个名叫皮亚诺扎岛上的美国空军飞行大队所发生的一系列事件的描写，揭示了一个非理性的、无秩序的、梦魇似的荒诞世界。小说中，根据“第二十二条军规”理论，只有疯子才能获准免于飞行，但必须由本人提出申请。但你一旦提出申请，恰好证明你是一个正常人，还是在劫难逃。

第二十二条军规还规定，飞行员飞满25架次就能回国。但规定又强调，你必须绝对服从命令，要不就不能回国。因此上级可以不断给飞行员增加飞行次数，而你不得违抗。如此反复，永无休止。突出代表一种美国式的“黑色幽默”（black humor）。

\3. 《第五号屠宰场》（Slaughterhouse-Five）库尔特·冯内古特（Kurt Vonnegut）

主人公毕利，在第二次世界大战中，他随部队到达欧洲，参加了保吉战役，结果被德军俘虏，随后到德国德累斯顿的一个地下屠宰场做苦工。德累斯顿是一座历史悠久的美丽古城，没有任何军事目标。然而就是这样一座城市，1945年却遭到英美联军的联合轰炸，被一夜间夷为平地。毕利被关在地下冷藏室而幸免于难，然而这段经历却给他造成无法愈合的精神创伤。 

毕利由于战争精神深受刺激，心理受创伤之后经常出现幻想：他遭遇飞碟绑架，被送到特拉法玛多星球，在星球动物园中像动物般被展出和观看。毕利挣脱了时间的羁绊，他就寝的时候，是个衰老的鳏夫，醒来时却在举行婚礼。他从1955年的门进去，却从另一个门1941年出来了。

\4.  《辛德勒名单》  ( Schindler's List) 托马斯·基尼利(Thamas Keneally)

布克奖的获奖小说，以高度纪实的手法，刻画了二次大战时期德国商人奥斯卡·辛德勒冒着生命危险，倾注所有财力和智慧，营救数百位犹太人生命的真实故事。问世以来，这部小说以其撼人心魄的真实性和洋溢于字里行间的人道主义的光辉，感动了无数读者，被斯皮尔伯格改编成电影以后成为电影史上的经典之作。

奥斯卡·辛德勒是一位具有传奇色彩的真实的历史人物。作者尽量避免一切的虚构，作了大量的案头工作和调查取证，尽量区别真实与神话传奇。将辛德勒描写得有血有肉，十分逼真，凡人的弱点和美德都统一于他一身。

A Clean, Well-Lighted Place

It was very late and everyone had left the café except an old man who sat in the shadow the leaves of the tree made against the electric light.

In the day time the street was dusty, but at night the dew settled the dust and the old man liked to sit late because he was deaf and now at night it was quiet and he felt the difference.

The two waiters inside the café knew that the old man was a little drunk, and while he was a good client they knew that if he became too drunk he would leave without paying, so they kept watch on him.

"Last week he tried to commit suicide," one waiter said. "Why?"

"He was in despair." "What about?" "Nothing."

"How do you know it was nothing?" "He has plenty of money."

They sat together at a table that was close against the wall near the door of the café and looked at the terrace where the tables were all empty except where the old man sat in the shadow of the leaves of the tree that moved slightly in the wind.

A girl and a soldier went by in the street. The street light shone on the brass number on his collar.

The girl wore no head covering and hurried beside him.

"The guard will pick him up," one waiter said.

> <font color=red>"The guard will pick him up," one waiter said. "What does it matter if he gets what he's after?"</font>

"What does it matter if he gets what he's after?"

"He had better get off the street now. The guard will get him. They went by five minutes ago."

The old man sitting in the shadow rapped on his saucer with his glass.

The younger waiter went over to him. "What do you want?"

The old man looked at him. "Another brandy," he said.

"You'll be drunk," the waiter said.

The old man looked at him. The waiter went away.

"He'll stay all night," he said to his colleague.

"I'm sleepy now. I never get into bed before three o'clock. He should have killed himself last week."

The waiter took the brandy bottle and another saucer from the counter inside the café and marched out to the old man's table.

He put down the saucer and poured the glass full of brandy.

"You should have killed yourself lastweek," he said to the deaf man.

The old man motioned with his finger. "A little more," he said.

"Thank you," the old man said. The waiter took the bottle back inside the café.

He sat down at the table with his colleague again.

"He's drunk now," he said. "He's drunk every night."

"What did he want to kill himself for?" "How should I know."

"How did he do it?" "He hung himself with a rope."

"Who cut him down?" "His niece."

"Why did they do it?" "Fear for his soul."

"How much money has he got?" "He's got plenty."

"He must be eighty years old." "Anyway I should say he was eighty."

"I wish he would go home. I never get to bed before three o'clock. What kind of hour is that to go to bed?"

"He stays up because he likes it."

"He's lonely. I'm not lonely. I have awife waiting in bed for me."

"He had a wife once too." "A wife would be no good to him now."

"You can't tell. He might be better with a wife."

"His niece looks after him. You said she cut him down." "I know."

"I wouldn't want to be that old. An old man is a nasty thing."

"Not always. This old man is clean. He drinks without spilling. Even now, drunk. Look at him."

"I don't want to look at him. I wish he would go home. He has no regard for those who must work."

The old man looked from his glass across the square, then over at the waiters.

"Another brandy," he said, pointing to his glass.

The waiter who was in a hurry came over.

"Finished," he said, speaking with that omission of syntax stupid people employ when talking to drunken people or foreigners.

The waiter wiped the edge of the table with a towel and shook his head.

The old man stood up, slowly counted the saucers, took a leather coin purse from his pocket and paid for the drinks, leaving half a peseta tip.

The waiter watched him go down the street, a very old man walking unsteadily but with dignity.

"Why didn't you let him stay and drink?" the unhurried waiter asked.

They were putting up the shutters. "It is not half-past two."

"I want to go home to bed." "What is an hour?"

"More to me than to him." "An hour is the same."

"You talk like an old man yourself. He can buy a bottle and drink at home."

"It's not the same." "No, it is not," agreed the waiter with a wife.

He did not wish to be unjust. He was only in a hurry.

"And you? You have no fear of going home before your usual hour?"

"Are you trying to insult me?"

"No, hombre ([西]先生，老弟), only to make a joke."

"No," the waiter who was in a hurry said, rising from pulling down the metal shutters.

"I have confidence. I am all confidence."

"You have youth, confidence, and a job," the older waiter said. "You have everything."

"And what do you lack?" "Everythingbut work."

"You have everything I have."

"No. I have never had confidence and I am not young."

"Come on. Stop talking nonsense and lock up."

"I am of those who like to stay late at the café," the older waiter said.

"With all those who do not want to go to bed. With all those who need a light for the night."

"I want to go home and into bed."

"We are of two different kinds," the older waiter said. He was now dressed to go home.

"It is not only a question of youth and confidence although those things are very beautiful.

Each night I am reluctant to close up because there may be some one who needs the café."

"Hombre, there are bodegas (尤指西班牙卖酒的小杂货店) open allnight long."

"You do not understand. This is a clean and pleasant café. It is well lighted.

The light is very good and also, now, there are shadows of the leaves."

"Good night," said the younger waiter. "Good night," the other said.

Turning off the electric light he continued the conversation with himself.

It was the light of course but it is necessary that the place be clean and pleasant.

You do not want music. Certainly you do not want music.

Nor can you stand before a bar with dignity although that is all that is provided for these hours.

What did he fear? It was not a fear or dread.

It was a nothing that he knew too well. It was all a nothing and a man was a nothing too.

It was only that and light was all it needed and a certain cleanness and order.

Some lived in it and never felt it but he knew it all was nada y pues nada y nada y pues nada ([西]除了虚无还是虚无).

Our nada who art in nada, nada be thy name thy kingdom nada thy will be nada in nada as it is in nada.

Give us this nada our daily nada and nada us our nada as we nada our nadas and nada us not into nada but deliver us from nada; puesnada.

Hail nothing full of nothing, nothing is with thee.

He smiled and stood before a bar with a shining steam pressure coffee machine.

"What's yours?" asked the barman. "Nada."

"Otro loco mas ([西]又是个神经病)," said the barman and turned away.

"A little cup," said the waiter. The barman poured it for him.

"The light is very bright and pleasant but the bar is unpolished," the waiter said.

> ==unpolished英 ['ʌn'pɒlɪʃt] 美 ['ʌn'pɒlɪʃt] adj. 粗鲁的；无光泽的；未磨光的；未磨练的==

The barman looked at him but did not answer. It was too late at night for conversation.

"You want another copita?" the barman asked.

"No, thank you," said the waiter andwent out.

He disliked bars and bodegas. A clean, well-lighted café was a very different thing.

Now, without thinking further, he would go home to his room.

He would lie in the bed and finally, with daylight, he would go to sleep.

After all, he said to himself, it's probably only insomnia. Many must have it.

### 背景知识

**💧****创作背景**

《一个干净明亮的地方》是海明威短篇小说中的经典之作，讲述了两个男服务生（一长一少）准备结束一个在咖啡厅工作的夜晚，结果遇到一个老人常客又来买醉迟迟不归。

该短篇小说写于1933年，收在1938年出版的《海明威短篇小说》中。亲历了第一次世界大战的灾难，海明威不仅身体受到重创（身中二百多块弹片），更可怕的是心灵的创伤再也无法弥合，“像神圣、光荣、牺牲这些空洞的字眼总令我困窘……我观察了很久，没有见到什么神圣的东西，原来光荣的东西也没呈现出光荣，而牺牲就像芝加哥的屠宰场，不同的只是把肉埋掉罢了”。

战争的体验使海明威这一代人对生活感到痛苦迷旧，对生命的本质和人的生存意义产生了怀疑。在这篇故事中，海明威的虚无主义得到集中的表达和呈现：生命的本质是虚无飘渺（Life is nothingless）. 同时故事中的这个老人，和海明威笔下的其他主角也有异曲同工之处——从他自杀和饮酒的两个选择行为来分析，他展现了重压之下的优雅风度和精神不败的尊严感。

**💧****写作手法**



《华盛顿邮报》的图书编辑罗恩·查尔斯就曾评价说，海明威的短篇小说比他的长篇小说更优秀（Washington Post's books editor, Ron Charles, has said that Hemingway’s short stories are better than his novels）. 《一个干净明亮的地方》里除了大量使用简短句子外，还运用了其他手法来达到一种四两拨千斤的效果和味道：



\1. 对比（Contrast）

海明威使用的主要是传统的对比手法，比如：咖啡馆的干净、安宁与酒吧的嘈杂形成对比；树叶的阴影与咖啡馆的明亮形成对比（The light is very good and also, now, there are shadows of the leaves）; 再比如，街道上嬉笑行走的大兵和少女与咖啡馆低头喝酒的老人的对比（...the old man sat in the shadow of the leaves of the tree that moved slightly in the wind. A girl and a soldier went by in the street）.

还有黑夜与明亮的对比；阴影与亮光的对比；老人的孤独、迷惘与年轻侍者的忙碌、满足及年老侍者的空虚、无奈的对比；年轻的侍者性急、有老婆、有信心与年老的侍者无老婆、无信心、没有稳定感的对比。

一切的对比无不显示着小说主题的表达：第一次世界大战后，随着美国梦的破灭，许多人的迷惘、借酒消愁、追求刺激、精神上一片荒芜，人们渴望关心和被理解，却依然生活在空虚的阴影之下。



\2. 象征（Symbolism）

首先这个西班牙的小咖啡馆就是一个象征：有灯光且清洁，是保持尊严的地方。但在作者的心里，它不是一个具体的场所“干净”，象征人的平静状态，以及对自我的坚定把握“光亮”则象征保持冷静清醒的头脑。

老人有清醒的头脑，但他感到时间、环境、家对他的毁灭性的打击，感到死亡带来的威胁与空虚，于是他到咖啡馆来“买醉”，因为这是“一个清洁明亮的地方”，他需要有个明亮的地方找寻安慰、友谊，他需要明亮的地方对抗心里无边的黑暗。



\3. 重复（Repetition）

年老侍者在他的内心独自中，多次重复“空虚”。海明威生活在理想、幻想破灭的时代，他一生都像一勇士去战斗，对抗孤独、黑暗与死亡。但另一方面，面对动荡不安的社会、没有信心和稳定感的人们，所以开始思考人的心灵深处的东西：孤独、麻木、没有信仰，没有物质和精神上的支持，没有具体方法摆脱现实处境的孤独与无奈。

此外“干净”和“光亮”也是小说中出现频率很高的词。这是在空虚之中迷惘一代所追求的——一个有着亮光而不孤独的地方去排遣自己的孤独。

### 课文理解

故事发生在西班牙的一家咖啡馆，到了很晚的时候，一位老人还在喝酒，他是这家咖啡馆的常客。两个侍者开始讨论起他来。从他们的对话中我们可以得知，这位老人很有钱，但却因为仅仅感到绝望而尝试上吊自杀，最后被外甥女给救了下来——



💧**Clue 1**: A rich man who frequents the café has tried to kill himself out of despair.



**Evidence 1**: "Last week he tried to commit suicide," one waiter said.

"Why?"

"He was in despair."

"What about?"

"Nothing."

"How do you know it was nothing?"

"He has plenty of money."

“上个礼拜他想自杀。”一个侍者说道。

“为什么？”

“绝望呗。”

“为了什么？”

“不为什么。”

“你怎么知道不为什么？”

“他很有钱。”



**Evidence 2**: "He's lonely. I'm not lonely. I have a wife waiting in bed for me." "He had a wife once too."

"A wife would be no good to him now."

"You can't tell. He might be better with a wife."

“他孤单，我可不孤单，我有一个在床上等我的老婆。”

“他也有过老婆。”

“现在老婆对他来说已经没什么用了。”

“这很难说。有老婆他可能会活得好一点。”



老人看起来已经有八十多岁（"He must be eighty years old." ）虽然家产丰厚，但并无亲近的人，只有一个外甥女在照顾他。年轻的侍者不能理解老人为何每天在咖啡馆待到凌晨，并且永远喝得大醉，他甚至觉得人老了就是邋里邋遢的模样（"I wouldn't want to be that old. An old man is a nasty thing."）



但另一位年长侍者的态度却截然不同，他不仅看到老人身上依然残存的风度，并且对他的孤独也深有所感——



💧**Clue 2**:  The older waiter full sympathizes with the old man and his loneliness.



**Evidence 1**: "Not always. This old man is clean. He drinks without spilling. Even now, drunk. Look at him."...The waiter watched him go down the street, a very old man walking unsteadily but with dignity.

“也不都是那样。这个老头就很干净。他喝酒从不流出来，就像现在，都喝醉了。你看他。”……侍者看着他顺着街道往前走，一个很老的老人，虽然步履蹒跚，但不失尊严。



**Evidence 2**: It was not a fear or dread. It was a nothing that he knew too well. It was all a nothing and a man was a nothing too. It was only that and light was all it needed and a certain cleanness and order.

这不是害怕或恐惧，是一种他太熟悉了的虚无。一切都是虚无，人也是一种虚无。所需要的只是灯光和某种程度的整洁。



老人富有，但缺乏其他情感支撑，而对年长的侍者来说也是如此，除了工作，其余的他也一无所有（"You have youth, confidence, and a job," the older waiter said. "You have everything." "And what do you lack?" "Everything but work."）因此他格外理解这种空虚，并不是只要在热闹的酒吧就能得到慰藉的。这种空虚需要的是灯光和整洁（象征着“体面和尊严”）。



因此这个短篇探讨的其实是虚无（nothingness）的问题，以及如何去面对虚无。咖啡馆提供的整洁和光亮虽然不能完全消除孤独和虚无，但却延缓了这种痛苦，所以老人每天在这喝酒到凌晨，而年长侍者也愿意让想留下来的客人待得更久一点（"I am of those who like to stay late at the café," the older waiter said. "With all those who do not want to go to bed. With all those who need a light for the night."）



而回到家之后，他还是必须得面对现实、承受失眠的痛苦。（He would lie in the bed and finally, with daylight, he would go to sleep. After all, he said to himself, it's probably only insomnia. Many must have it.）

**💧Coffee Shop Etiquette Rules**

**咖啡店的礼貌守则**

当老人迟迟不肯离去的时候，年轻的侍者十分不耐烦："I don't want to look at him. I wish he would go home. He has no regard for those who must work."（“我不想看。我希望他回家去。他一点都不在乎那些必须上班的人。”）

当时已经凌晨三点了，老人这么做显然不够礼貌得体。今天的彩蛋我们就来了解一下在咖啡店必须注意哪些礼貌守则吧~

\1. Don't sit there all day with one drink in front of you

别在咖啡店坐一整天但只点一杯饮品

长时间地占有咖啡厅的座位虽然不会遭受驱赶，但其实是一件非常不礼貌的事情哦~就像我们不会在饭店里吃完午饭就坐上一整天直到晚饭时间一样，否则别人会当你这是在咖啡店“借宿”（to camp in a coffee shop）.



并且当有人只是想进来吃个蛋糕、喝杯咖啡或者坐下来休息聊会天，结果发现里面的人都是只点了一杯咖啡而坐着对了仨小时电脑的人，不免会很失望（Two people might want to come in and have cake, coffee, and a conversation. But they might be stopped by someone sitting at a laptop for three hours sipping a cup of tea.）长期以往也会影响咖啡店的盈利（对于独立的小咖啡馆而言）。



\2. Don't take conference calls in shops and talk loudly

别旁若无人地大声打视频电话

如果真的需要打视频电话，最好走到外面，而不是在安静或者需要维持个人空间独立的咖啡厅内（If you have to jump on a conference call, please take it outside it you can）. 

尤其是当你还是主讲人的时候，更不要旁若无人地在咖啡店里高谈阔论（If you're the dominant audio source in the cafe, you shouldn't be）. 



\3. Don't stretch an extension cord across the floor to plug in your laptop

别在咖啡店拉插线板来给电脑充电

不能插线板主要是出于安全考虑，尤其当其他客人在咖啡店里端着热咖啡到处移动的时候，除了可能会被绊倒，如果咖啡撒到插线板上，还有可能起火灾（Someone might trip on extension cords and spill out hot coffee）.

实在需要充电，可以和坐在插座旁的客人商量是否可以换位。但绝对不要自作主张地在咖啡厅里拉起插线板哦~



\4. Don't ask someone to watch your laptop

不要叫旁边的人帮你看电脑

有时候我们会犯懒，需要上洗手间或是短暂离开座位的时候总爱让旁边的人帮我们看一下电脑，而不愿意花一点工夫把电脑收进包里然后一起带到洗手间（Don't burden some poor sap sitting next to you just because you're too lazy to put your laptop into a bag and haul it into the bathroom）.

虽然对方也许会客气地答应，但这实际上是一件不太礼貌的事情。比如万一对方也需要上洗手间或者有急事需要马上离开呢？另一方面，假设对方真的离开了，又由谁来看着呢？（Besides, what if they have to go to the bathroom too? Who will watch the watcher's laptop.）因此出于为双方的考虑，最好的是自己能做的事情自己来完成。

The Doctor and the Doctor's Wife

Dick boulton came from the Indian camp to cut up logs for Nick’s father.

He brought his son Eddy and another Indian named Billy Tabeshaw with him.

They came in through the back gate out of the woods, Eddy carrying the long cross-cut saw.

It flopped over his shoulder and made a musical sound as he walked.

Billy Tabeshaw carried two big canthooks.

Dick had three axes under his arm. He turned and shut the gate.

The others went on ahead of him down to the lake shore where the logs were buried in the sand.

The logs had been lost from the big log booms that were towed down the lake to the mill by the steamer Magic.

> ②were towed down the lake “在湖面上托运”；tow和pull意思相同，表示“牵引，拖，拉”，比如：The ship had to be towed into the harbor.（那艘轮船不得不被拖进港口。） 

They had drifted up onto the beach and if nothing were done about them sooner or later the crew of theMagic would come along the shore in a rowboat, spot the logs, drive aniron spike with a ring on it into the end of each one and then tow themout into the lake to make a new boom.

But the lumbermen might never come for them because a few logs were not worth the price of a crew to gather them.

If no one came for them they would be left to waterlog and rot on the beach.

> ==waterlog英 ['wɔ:təlɒg] 美 ['wɔ:təˌlɔ:g] n. 涝灾==

Nick’s father always assumed that this was what would happen, and hired the Indians to come down from the camp and cut the logs up with the cross-cut saw and split them with a wedge to make cord wood and chunks for the open fireplace.

Dick Boulton walked around past the cottage down to the lake.

There were four big beech logs lying almost buried in the sand.

Eddy hung the saw up by one of its handles in the crotch of a tree.

Dick put the three axes down on the little dock.

Dick was a halfbreed and many of the farmers around the lake believed he was really a white man.He was very lazy but a great workeronce he was started.

He took a plug of tobacco out of hispocket, bit off a chew and spoke in Ojibway to Eddy and Billy Tabeshaw.

They sunk the ends of their cant-hooks into one of the logs and swung against it to loosen it in the sand.

> *这里形容他们握着钩杆抵在原木上转动，cant-hook是一种一端装有活动钩的木杆，用来钩住原木使其翻转。

They swung their weight against theshafts of the cant-hooks. The log moved in the sand.

Dick Boulton turned to Nick’s father.

“Well, Doc,” he said, “that’s a nice lot of timber you’ve stolen.”

“Don’t talk that way, Dick,” the doctor said.

“It’s driftwood.” Eddy and Billy Tabeshaw had rocked the log out of the wet sand and rolled it toward the water.

“Put it right in,” Dick Boulton shouted.

“What are you doing that for?” asked the doctor.

“Wash it off. Clean off the sand on account of the saw. I want to see who it belongs to,” Dick said.

The log was just awash in the lake. Eddy and Billy Tabeshaw leaned ontheir cant-hooks sweating in the sun.

> ==awash==

>
> 所有的人行道上全是垃圾。

Dick kneeled down in the sand and looked at the mark of the scaler’s hammer in the wood at the end of the log.

“It belongs to White and McNally,” he said, standing up and brushing off his trousers knees.

The doctor was very uncomfortable.

“You’d better not saw it up then, Dick,” he said, shortly.

Don’t get huffy, Doc,” said Dick. “Don’t get huffy. I don’t care who you steal from. It’s none of my business.”

“If you think the logs are stolen, leave them alone and take your tools back to the camp,” the doctor said.

His face was red. “Don’t go off at half cock, Doc,” Dick said.

He spat tobacco juice on the log. It slid off, thinning in the water.

“Now, Doc—” “Take your stuff and get out.” “Listen, Doc.”

“Oh, no, you won’t, Doc.” Dick Boulton looked at the doctor.

Dick was a big man. He knew how big a man he was.

He liked to get into fights. He was happy.

Eddy and Billy Tabeshaw leaned on their cant-hooks and looked at the doctor.

The doctor chewed the beard on hislower lip and looked at Dick Boulton.

Then he turned away and walked up the hill to the cottage.

They could see from his back how angry he was.

They all watched him walk up the hill and go inside the cottage.

Dick said something in Ojibway. Eddy laughed but Billy Tabeshaw looked very serious.

He did not understand English but he had sweat all the time the row was going on.

He was fat with only a few hairs of mustache like a Chinaman.

He picked up the two cant-hooks. Dick picked up the axes and Eddy took the saw down from the tree.

They started off and walked up past the cottage and out the back gate into the woods.

Dick left the gate open. Billy Tabeshaw went back and fastened it.

They were gone through the woods.

In the cottage the doctor, sitting on the bed in his room, saw a pile of medical journals on the floor by the bureau.

They were still in their wrappers unopened. It irritated him.

“Aren’t you going back to work, dear?” asked the doctor’s wife from the room where she was lying with the blinds drawn.

“No!” “Was anything the matter?” “I had a row with Dick Boulton.”

“Oh,” said his wife. “I hope you didn’t lose your temper, Henry.” “No,” said the doctor.

“Remember, that he who ruleth his spirit is greater than he that taketh acity,” said his wife.

He pushed the magazine full of the heavy yellow shells and pumped them out again.

They were scattered on the bed.

“Henry,” his wife called. Then paused a moment.

“Henry!” “Yes,” the doctor said.

“You didn’t say anything to Boulton to anger him, did you?” “No,” said the doctor.

“What was the trouble about, dear?”“Nothing much.”

“Tell me, Henry. Please don’t try and keep anything from me. What was the trouble about?”

“Well, Dick owes me a lot of money for pulling his squaw through pneumonia and I guess he wanted a row so he wouldn’t have to take itout in work.”

His wife was silent. The doctor wiped his gun carefully with a rag.

He pushed the shells back in against the spring of the magazine.

He sat with the gun on his knees. He was very fond of it.

Then he heard his wife’s voice from the darkened room.

“Dear, I don’t think, I really don’t think that any one would really do a thing like that.” “No?” the doctor said.

“No. I can’t really believe that any one would do a thing of that sort intentionally.” The doctor stood up and put the shotgun in the corner behind the dresser.

“Are you going out, dear?” his wife said. “I think I’ll go for a walk,” the doctor said.

If you see Nick, dear, will you tell him his mother wants to see him?” his wife said.

The doctor went out on the porch. The screen door slammed behind him.

He heard his wife catch her breath when the door slammed.

“Sorry,” he said, outside her windowwith the blinds drawn.

“It’s all right, dear,” she said.

He walked in the heat out the gate and along the path into the hemlockwoods.

It was cool in the woods even on such a hot day.

He found Nick sitting with his back against a tree, reading.

“Your mother wants you to come and see her,” the doctor said. “I want to go with you,” Nick said.

His father looked down at him. “All right. Come on, then,”

his father said. “Give me the book, I’ll put it in my pocket.”

“I know where there’s black squirrels, Daddy,” Nick said. “All right,” said his father. “Let’s go there.”

### 背景知识

**💧Fireplace in Western Family**

**壁炉——西方家庭的标志物**

医生带着帮手来到岸边锯原木，就是为了能把它们做成小木料或者是敞口壁炉用的柴禾（...and cut the logs up with the cross-cut saw and split them with a wedge to make cord wood and chunks for the open fireplace）. 说到壁炉，它几乎已经成为西方家庭（寒冷地区）的一个标志物，除了发展历史悠久，还衍生出了不少文化和迷信传统——

壁炉（fireplace或masonry heater）是独立或者就墙壁砌成的室内取暖设备，以可燃物为能源，内部上通烟囱，起源于西方家庭或宫殿取暖设施。由于其燃料为可再生资源，加以现代化改进，目前仍然在西方普遍使用，尤其在主张环保理念的高等教育阶层受到欢迎。壁炉分开放式和封闭式两种，后者热效率高的多。

开放式壁炉

早期人们在小屋或住处的中心挖一个浅坑，在其中放置木材生火取暖。燃烧产生的烟从屋顶的洞冒出。几千年后，随着两层建筑的出现，人们将壁炉移到建筑的外面。这时候的壁炉仍然是水平式的，因此常常将烟吹到外面，或是飘进室内。后来，利用烟囱将烟带到住处的外面，解决了这个困扰。

1578年的时候，Prince Ruppert建立改良气流和排放系统的壁炉炉囱。在18世纪时壁炉有两次重要的发展。Ben Franklin建立一个对流室，大大的改进壁炉和燃木室（wood stoves）的效率。而且，他在火堆的下方空出一个空间（basement）吸入空气，以造成一个由下往上的气流，将废气带到较高处。在18世纪后期，Count Rumford设计出一个高且浅的燃烧室，使其有更好的排气效果，能将废气往上引导且排放至屋外。

Rumford的设计是现代壁炉的基础。在北美和欧洲，在气候上较冷的地方，壁炉一直是一个家庭的主要特点，因为它给人们温暖，而得以渡过漫长冬季。烘烤温暖的感觉，和跳跃与闪烁的火焰，即使到了今天，依然让人在寒冷天气下觉得愉快。

由于壁炉的特殊重要性，它和人们的生活以及文化也产生了或大或小的联系。比如有这样一个仪式：在点燃炉火的时候，把和周围人数一样多的小石头放置在壁炉中，如果第二天早上如果有一块石头被挪动，主人就会在这一年去世。另外在多塞特的礼拜五节，在壁炉中悬挂一块烤面包据说会保证来年五谷丰登。

对于西方家庭来说，只要有条件，壁炉绝对是不可或缺的东西。虽然国内也有设计有壁炉的房屋，但一般受限于房屋结构，采暖方式大都是集中供暖，所以壁炉只作为装饰用，实用价值不大。 

### 课文理解

这个短篇的标题里提及的The Doctor是海明威另一篇故事《印第安人营地》（*Indian Camp*）里的主角，讲述的是他带着儿子Nick到印第安人那儿为一位难产的孕妇接生，并且展现出了重压下从容不迫的风度。但在今天的故事里，这位医生则显露了与之前截然不同的一面，也就是他的伪善之处。

当他的其中一位雇工Dick既调侃又鄙夷地说到他把河滩边的原木锯下来带回家无异于偷窃时——这些木头是从开往锯木厂的轮船上遗失下来的，之后很有可能会有轮船工人来回收（The logs had been lost from the big log booms that were towed down the lake to the mill by the steamer Magic）——医生恼羞成怒，因为自己就这么被堂而皇之地当成了窃贼（事实也的确如此）。



💧**Clue 1**: The Doctor is angrily embarrassed and shamed by being known as a thief.



**Evidence 1**: Dick Boulton turned to Nick’s father. “Well, Doc,” he said, “that’s a nice lot of timber you’ve stolen.” “Don’t talk that way, Dick,” the doctor said. “It’s driftwood.”

迪克·博尔顿对尼克的父亲回过头来说：“我说，医生，”他说，“你偷到了好大一批木材啊。”

“别这么说，迪克，”医生说。“这是飘上岸来的木头。”



**Evidence 2**: “Don’t get huffy, Doc,” said Dick. “Don’t get huffy. I don’t care who you steal from. It’s none of my business.” “If you think the logs are stolen, leave them alone and take your tools back to the camp,” the doctor said. His face was red.

“别发火啊，医生。”迪克说。“别发火。我才不管你是偷谁的。这不关我的事。”

“你要是认为木头是偷来的，就不锯算了，带着你的工具会营地去。”医生说。他的脸都红了。



医生气冲冲地回到了家，并且向妻子讲述了经过。他还猜想这个印第安人Dick可能是为了拖欠之前医生治好他妻子肺炎的医疗费，才故意找茬和医生吵架，接着被医生赶走得以脱身。（“Well, Dick owes me a lot of money for pulling his squaw through pneumonia and I guess he wanted a row so he wouldn’t have to take it out in work.”）



但医生的妻子认为他是恶意揣测（“Dear, I don’t think, I really don’t think that any one would really do a thing like that.”）还用《圣经》里的道义来教育他（“Remember, that he who ruleth his spirit is greater than he that taketh a city,” said his wife）. 医生又走回到林子里，他的儿子Nick显然察觉出了发生的一切，并且他也用实际行动来表明自己站在父亲的一边——



💧**Clue 2**:  The Doctor's son Nick is on his side.



**Evidence 1**: “Are you going out, dear?” his wife said. “I think I’ll go for a walk,” the doctor said. “If you see Nick, dear, will you tell him his mother wants to see him?” his wife said.

“你这是要出去走吗，亲爱的？”他的妻子说。

“我想出去走走。”医生说。

“亲爱的，你要是看见尼克，请跟他说妈妈要找他，行吗？”妻子说。



**Evidence 2**: He found Nick sitting with his back against a tree, reading. “Your mother wants you to come and see her,” the doctor said. “I want to go with you,” Nick said. His father looked down at him. “All right. Come on, then,” his father said.

他看见尼克背靠着一棵树坐着，正在看书。

“你母亲要你进去看看她。”医生说。

“我要跟你一起去。”尼克说。

他父亲低头看着他。“行啊，那就快走吧。”他父亲说。



医生和妻子的处世态度及方式截然不同，这里俩人的矛盾虽然没有在明面上展现，但也暗暗埋下了紧张的气氛。临出门前，妻子最后“发号施令”，让儿子Nick进来找妈妈。但医生见到儿子传达后，Nick并没有服从母亲的传令，而是选择了跟父亲待在一起。说明儿子其实对父亲和母亲之间的对立矛盾有所察觉，在这种情况下，他选择和父亲一起走的用意就十分明显了。



因此也有很多人认为，这篇小说投射了海明威对母亲甚至是母性权威的厌恶和逃避（他自小和父亲亲密，但和母亲十分疏远）。这也解释了为什么海明威的小说中女性角色塑造往往有缺失和偏颇，而他打造的硬汉形象则深入人心。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧Fun Facts About Squirrels**

**松鼠趣闻**



儿子Nick最后说要带父亲一起去看黑色的松鼠（“I know where there’s black squirrels, Daddy,” Nick said. “All right,” said his father. “Let’s go there.”）松鼠在国外是一种很常见的动物，今天的彩蛋我们就来了解一下关于松鼠的那些趣事秘闻吧~



\1. Food 食物

松鼠除了喜欢吃坚果，其实也会以小型昆虫、草根、树皮、树叶和橡子为食（Aside from the famous love of nuts, the facts are these furry friends of ours can also dine on small insects, roots, tree bark, leaves and acorns）.

虽然松鼠一年四季都有储藏食物的习惯，但是到了秋天尤甚（Squirrels will typically gather and save a lot of their food all year round but this is definitely true when it comes to the autumn time）. 他们会到处搜集坚果并且埋起来，冬天一走，他们就会从休眠中醒过来然后去找过冬前埋下的食物（After they have buried all of their food and when winter comes and goes, the squirrel will wake up out of hibernation and go look for the food they buried）.



\2. Apperance 样貌

松鼠的英文名称squirrel其实来自古希腊语的Skiouros, 意思是“shadow tail”（“像黑影一样的尾巴”），这是因为松鼠的尾巴毛发旺盛，看起来毛茸茸的（brushy and fluffy）, 像把刷子一样。

在全球，松鼠的种类多达200多种（In fact, there are 200 different kinds of Squirrels worldwide）. 其中最著名的一种是“飞天松鼠”（the flying squirrel）, 它们的身体有和蝙蝠及其他滑行哺乳动物相似的特殊结构——“翼膜”（patagium）, 这就使得它们可以在空中飞行（to glide through the air）. 科学家还声称，飞天松鼠从150英尺高的地方急速俯冲下来都没问题（They could daringly take the plunge from 150 feet）.

另外，全世界最小的松鼠品种，身形不过比一只普通茶杯大不了几英寸（just a few inches bigger than a typical teacup）. 这种松鼠来自于非洲，身长只有大约10厘米。而世界上最大的松鼠（Alpine Marmot）体长则可以达到73厘米。



\3. Birth 出生

成年松鼠的视力非常好，但刚出生的松鼠其实是什么也看不见的，相当于全盲（Despitehaving perfect vision as adults, baby squirrels are blind at birth）.

松鼠妈妈每年最多生两胎，一次在春天，另一次在夏天快结束的时候（Once in the spring time and once at the end of the summer）. 一胎一般生2到8个小松鼠，松鼠宝宝也会称作kitten（kitten也可以指刚出生的小猫哦~）。在接下来的几个月里，松鼠宝宝都靠母乳喂养成长，之后才能独立出去觅食（After that, these individuals grow mature and can fully hunt for food themselves）.



\4. Behavior 行为

当松鼠们聚集在一起生活的时候，它们往往会发展出一种“同志情谊”（camaraderie）, 表现为一种利他主义（altruism）. 比如当危险靠近的时候，它们会向同伴发出警告并一起协同躲避捕食者（When they feel that there is danger approaching. They produce warning calls to alert their fellow rodents from lurking predators）.

而发现危险并进行预警的那只松鼠会特地留到最后才离开。如果不是强烈的利他主义精神，它肯定第一个就溜之大吉了！

一般松鼠住在树洞里（the holes of trunks）或者是树梢上乌鸦遗弃的鸟窝里（in the treetop in abandoned crow's nests）. 到了一岁左右，它们开始寻找配偶，这时候它们才会找筑巢的地方（Squirrels will usually start looking for a nest when they start to mate）.

The End of Something

In the old days Hortons Bay was a lumbering town.

No one who lived in it was out of sound of the big saws in the mill by the lake.

the travelling carriage that hurled the logs against the revolving, circular saws and all the rollers, wheels, belts and iron piled on a hull-deep load of lumber.

The one-story bunk houses, the eating-house, the company store, the mill offices, and the big mill itself stood deserted in the acres of sawdust that covered the swampy meadow by the shore of the bay.

They were trolling along the edge of the channel-bank where the bottom dropped off suddenly from sandy shallows to twelve feet of dark water.

They were trolling on their way to set night lines for rainbow trout.

"There's our old ruin, Nick," Marjorie said.

Nick, rowing, looked at the white stone in the green trees. "There it is," he said.

"Can you remember when it was a mill?" Marjorie asked. "I can just remember," Nick said.

"It seems more like a castle," Marjorie said.

Nick said nothing. They rowed on out of sight of the mill, following the shore line. Then Nick cut across the bay.

"They aren't striking," he said.

"No," Marjorie said. She was intent on the rod all the time they trolled, even when she talked.

She loved to fish. She loved to fish with Nick.

Close beside the boat a big trout broke the surface of the water.

Nick pulled hard on one oar so the boat would turn and the bait, spinning far behind, would pass where the trout was feeding.

As the trout's back came up out of the water the minnows jumped wildly.

They sprinkled the surface like a handful of shot thrown into the water.

Another trout broke water, feeding on the other side of the boat.

"They're feeding," Marjorie said.

"But they won't strike," Nick said.

He rowed the boat around to troll past both the feeding fish, then headed it for the point.

Marjorie did not reel in until the boat touched the shore.

They pulled the boat up the beach and Nick lifted out a pail of live perch.

The perch swam in the water pail. Nick caught three of them with his hands and cut heir heads off and skinned them while Marjorie chased with her hands in the bucket,

finally caught a perch, cut its head off and skinned it. Nick looked at her fish.

"You don't want to take the ventral fin out," he said. "It'll be all right for bait but it's better with the ventral finin."

He hooked each of the skinned perch through the tail.

There were two hooks attached to aleader on each rod.

Then Marjorie rowed the boat out over the channel-bank, holding the line in her teeth, and looking toward Nick, who stood on the shore holding the rod and letting the line run out from the reel.

"That's about right," he called.

"Should I let it drop?" Marjorie called back, holding the line in her hand.

"Sure. Let it go." Marjorie dropped the line overboard and watched the baits go down through the water.

She came in with the boat and ran the second line out the same way.

Each time Nick set a heavy slab of driftwood across the butt of the rod to hold it solid and propped it up at an angle with a small slab.

He reeled in the slack line so the line ran taut out to where the bait rested on the sandy floor of the channel and set the click on the reel.

When a trout, feeding on the bottom, took the bait it would run with it, taking line out of the reel in a rush and making the reel sing with the click on.

Marjorie rowed up the point a little way so she would not disturb the line.

She pulled hard on the oars and the boat went up the beach. Little waves came in with it.

Marjorie stepped out of the boat and Nick pulled the boat high up the beach.

"What's the matter, Nick?" Marjorie asked.

"I don't know," Nick said, getting wood for a fire.

They made a fire with driftwood. Marjorie went to the boat and brought a blanket.

The evening breeze blew the smoke toward the point, so Marjorie spread the blanket out between the fire and the lake.

Marjorie sat on the blanket with her back to the fire and waited for Nick.

He came over and sat down beside her on the blanket.

In back of them was the close second-growth timber of the point and in front was the bay with the mouth of Hortons Creek.

It was not quite dark. The fire-light went as far as the water.

They could both see the two steel rods at an angle over the dark water. The fire glinted on the reels.

Marjorie unpacked the basket of supper. "I don't feel like eating," said Nick. "Come on and eat, Nick." "All right."

They ate without talking, and watched the two rods and the fire-light in the water.

"There's going to be a moon tonight," said Nick.

He looked across the bay to the hills that were beginning to sharpen against the sky.

Beyond the hills he knew the moon was coming up.

"I know it," Marjorie said happily. "You know everything," Nick said.

"Oh, Nick, please cut it out! Please, please don't be that way!"

"I can't help it," Nick said. "You do. You know everything. That's the trouble. You know you do." Marjorie did not say anything.

"I've taught you everything. You know you do. What don't you know, anyway?" "Oh, shut up," Marjorie said. "There comes the moon."

They sat on the blanket without touching each other and watched the moon rise. "You don't have to talk silly," Marjorie said. "What's really the matter?"

"I don't know." "Of course you know." "No I don't." "Go on and say it."

Nick looked on at the moon, coming up over the hills. "It isn't fun any more."

He was afraid to look at Marjorie. Then he looked at her.

She sat there with her back toward him. He looked at her back. "It isn't fun any more. Not any of it."

She didn't say anything. He went on.

"I feel as though everything was gone to hell inside of me. I don't know, Marge. I don't know what to say."

He looked on at her back."Isn't love any fun?" Marjorie said.

"No," Nick said. Marjorie stood up. Nick sat there, his head in his hands.

"I'm going to take the boat," Marjorie called to him. "You can walk back around the point."

"All right," Nick said. "I'll push the boat off for you."

"You don't need to," she said.

She was afloat in the boat on the water with the moonlight on it.

Nick went back and lay down with his face in the blanket by the fire. He could hear Marjorie rowing on the water.

He lay there for a long time. He lay there while he heard Bill come into the clearing walking around through the woods.

He felt Bill coming up to the fire. Billdidn't touch him, either.

"Did she go all right?" Bill said.

"Yes," Nick said, lying, his face on the blanket. "Have a scene?"

"No, there wasn't any scene." "How do you feel?"

"Oh, go away, Bill! Go away for a while."

Bill selected a sandwich from the lunch basket and walked over to have a look at the rods.

### 背景知识

**💧1. The vicissitudes of logging in America**

**美国伐木业的兴衰**

我们今天的故事发生在这样的背景之下：霍斯顿湾原来有丰富的木材资源，丰富的木材资源使这座城市变成木材业城市。但是现在由于木材已经开采完毕，城市开始衰败，木材工厂已经荡然无存（In the old days Hortons Bay was a lumbering town. No one who lived in it was out of sound of the big saws in the mill by the lake. Then one year there were no more logs to make lumber. ）我们今天一起来了解一下美国历史上真实存在的伐木业兴衰变迁。

美国伐木业兴起于17世纪，当英国的先驱者开始探索非洲大陆的茂密的原始森林时，美国的伐木业开始第一次腾飞。

加利福尼亚州的硬木对投资者特别有吸引力，18世纪90年代，新英格兰地区生产了36000000英尺松木板。在1840年至1900年，这里失去了大部分森林。

19世纪末到20世纪初，伐木工是个让人羡慕的职业。随着美国西部“淘金热”（Gold Rush）的兴起，成千上万人涌入加州淘金，伐木业也由此兴盛，并迅速成为美国西部最大的支柱产业。

当时，这些伐木工仅有斧子、锯子等简陋工具，却展现出了强大的破坏力，大片两三千年树龄、数十到上百米的红杉被砍伐倒下。

随着森林砍伐造成的环境问题越来越突出，美国社会对森林的认识观念也发生着变化。著名的浪漫主义作家夏多布利昂（Viscount De Chateaubriand）曾说过：“除了森林以外，美国没有什么是古老的。” 伟大的超验主义者亨利·梭罗（Henry David Thoreau）把森林所代表的荒野与人类文明相提并论，写道：“在荒野中世界得以保存！”

时光飞逝，百年过去，当时让人羡慕的伐木工却成为了一个濒临消失的职业。美国劳工局数据显示，2012年到2022年，预计伐木工的雇佣下滑率将达到43.3%，曾经盛极一时的伐木业已成明日黄花。

对自然环境的保护固然是让伐木业衰落的一个原因，另一方面，随着科技的进步，自动化的机器作业逐渐取代了传统人力劳动，导致伐木业大量劳动力过剩，大批伐木工人下岗。

\2. Autobiography

小说的自传性质

我们今天的短篇是海明威的半自传体小说，在1919年夏天，20岁的海明威与一个17岁的度假村服务生Marjorie Bump约会。Marjorie经常给海明威准备野餐的食物，他们会在夜晚的营火边用餐。在劳动节后Marjorie的暑期工作结束后，海明威又开始和其他人约会。文中虚构的人物Bill是以Bill Smith为原型，他是和海明威一起度过那个夏天的好朋友。

海明威很多短篇小说都以Nick Adams为主人公，比如：*Indian Camp*，*The Killers*等，他以自身为原型塑造了Nick，海明威和Nick拥有相似的经历，使这些短篇小说带有明显的自传性质。

在这些小说中Nick经历了生活的磨难，慢慢地体验和认识到了许多新的知识，学会了接受自己及现实世界的不如意之处。他所经历的这种从天真走向成熟、从依附走向独立、从盲从走向自主、从关注自我走向关注社会以及从无知走向自我完善的过程就是其从儿童期走向成年期，成为一名成熟的社会成员的过程。著名的评论家杨·菲力浦曾说 “典型的尼克·亚当斯故事就是成长故事。”

### 课文理解

今天故事的主角是长大后了的Nick（在The Doctor and the Doctor's Wife里出现的医生的儿子），他和一位叫作Marjorie的姑娘正在交往，并且一起来到霍尔顿斯湾（Hortons Bay）钓鱼。这一片地区曾经是伐木重镇，但是在伐木业衰落后，就只剩寥寥的遗迹来显示曾经的兴盛了。



因此标题The End of Something里的Something也是一个双关，它同时代表了伐木全盛时期的衰落（the end of the heydays of logging industry）以及Nick和女友Marjorie关系的结束. （the end of the romantic relationship between Nick and Marjorie）. 我们分别来看这两条主线是如何交叉联系在一起的——



💧**Clue 1**: The end of the heydays of logging industry.



**Evidence 1**: The one-story bunk houses, the eating-house, the company store, the mill offices, and the big mill itself stood deserted in the acres of sawdust that covered the swampy meadow by the shore of the bay.

一座座平房工棚、食堂、公司栈房、工厂办公室和大厂房本身都空无一人，留在湖湾边潮湿的草地上大片大片的锯木屑中。



**Evidence 2**: "There's our old ruin, Nick," Marjorie said.

Nick, rowing, looked at the white stone in the green trees. "There it is," he said.

"Can you remember when it was a mill?" Marjorie asked.

"I can just remember," Nick said.

"It seems more like a castle," Marjorie said.

Nick said nothing.

“那就是我们那老厂的废墟，尼克。”玛乔丽说。

尼克一边划着船，一边看着绿树从里的白石。“就在这儿。”他说。

“你还记得当初这是个工厂的情景吗？”玛乔丽问。

“我就快不记得了。”尼克说。

“看上去更像座城堡。”玛乔丽说。

尼克一言不发。



这里就已经为Nick和Marjorie的分手埋下了伏笔。Marjorie看到废墟的时候觉得它们就像城堡一样，但Nick并没有对她的这种浪漫联想（romantic imagination）作出任何回应，凸显出了他的兴致寡然以及冷淡疏离。尔后俩人上岸野餐，结果爆发了争吵——



💧**Clue 2**: The end of the romantic relationship betwen Nick and Marjorie.



**Evidence 1**: "It isn't fun any more." He was afraid to look at Marjorie. Then he looked at her. She sat there with her back toward him. He looked at her back. "It isn't fun any more. Not any of it."

“再也没劲了。”他不敢对玛乔丽看。过了会儿才对她看。她背朝着他，坐在那儿。他看着她的背影。“再也没劲儿了。一点劲儿也没了。”



**Evidence 2**: She didn't say anything. He went on. "I feel as though everything was gone to hell inside of me. I don't know, Marge. I don't know what to say." He looked on at her back.

"Isn't love any fun?" Marjorie said.

"No," Nick said.

她一言不发。他径自说下去。“我感到心里万念俱灰。我不知道，玛吉（Marge是Marjorie的昵称）。我不知道说什么才好。”他继续看着她的背影。

“难道爱情也没劲儿？”玛乔丽说。

“对。”尼克说。



Marjorie十分生气，走的时候连Nick提出帮她把船推下水的请求也拒绝了（Nick said. "I'll push the boat off for you. "You don't need to," she said.）但故事的紧张氛围并没有以此为结束，最后出现的一幕可以说才是整篇小说的点睛之笔：Nick在空地上躺了一会儿，他的朋友Bill出现了，Bill开口的第一句话就是："Did she go all right?"（“她当真走了吗？”）接着又问道："Have a scene?"（“吵了一场？”）



为什么不在场的Bill知道Nick和Marjorie提了分手呢？只能说明Nick其实早有计划并且一直在酝酿，而不是一时冲动做的决定（not spur-of-the-moment）. 这样也解释了Nick为什么在钓鱼的过程中表现冷淡，甚至还刻意找茬和Marjorie闹不愉快（"I know it," Marjorie said happily. "You know everything," Nick said. "Oh, Nick, please cut it out! Please, please don't be that way!"）



和Marjorie分手也并没有让Nick多好受（"How do you feel?" "Oh, go away, Bill! Go away for a while."）而他具体的心理活动和想法并没有再展开描述。作者把这一部分留在了我们下一个短篇小说The Three-Day Blow里：山顶小屋外大风刮了三天，借此Nick也向Bill袒露了自己的真实感受，他究竟是追悔莫及还是对于自己的选择坚定不移呢？我们一起期待明天的故事吧~

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****Second-growth/Secondary Forest**

**次生林**

在我们今天的内容中有这样的场景：十年以后，尼克和玛乔丽沿岸划着船来，这里除了厂基那断裂的白灰石露出在沼泽地的次生林之外，工厂已荡然无存。（Ten years later there was nothing of the mill left except the broken white limestone of its foundations showing through the swampy second growth as Nick and Marjorie rowed along the shore.）那么什么是次生林呢，我们一起来了解一下吧～

关于次生林的定义，国内外多有不同。中国的定义为：次生林是原始林或人工林经人为或自然破坏之后未经合理经营，又借助自然力恢复起来的一类天然林。国际热带木材组织（International Tropical Timber Organization)的定义为：次生林是在原始林植被遭受破坏后形成的裸露土地上再生的林木植被，这种次生植被是以自然的方式在游垦地、农地、牧地或培育用材林不成功的废弃地上自然发育和演替的。ITTO还将强度干扰后暂以灌木和杂草为主的林地称为“退化林地”。各种定义都认为：次生林来源于原始林遭受干扰后形成的裸地，并以天然恢复为主。

次生林可分为以下类型：过度采伐的次生林（post-extraction secondary forests）；弃耕后恢复的次生林（swidden fallow secondary forests）；火灾引起的次生林（post-fire forests）；人工恢复的次生林（rehabilitated secondary forests）.

次生林涵盖了从裸地到已接近天然林的所有次生植被类型，它以区域形式存在，或许也会镶嵌有少量的原始林或人工林。特别重要的是，次生林区域是山区居民主要的生产和生活场所，因此次生林受到的人类社会压力比一般森林资源更大。次生林代表着一种日益重要的森林资源，如果得到正确的经营，它完全能够为地方、国家和国际社会提供所需要的各种财产与服务。

次生林占全球森林面积的近60%，其余的是天然林、人工林和经济林等。从这个意义上说，只有次生林实现了可持续经营，才会真正地实现森林可持续经营目标。次生林的重要性体现在：维系社区生态环境和居民生计，满足木材及其他各种林产品需求，具有环境战略价值。次生林的可持续经营和利用是一个战略性问题。



位于英国牛津郡泰晤士河上游盆地的中心的威萨姆森林（Wytham woods），为牛津大学所有， 被称为淡褐色（Hazel）的森林，是落叶林地和草地的美丽集合。它的林地大致分为三个区域：原生代、次生林和种植园林。其中次生林地占地面积三分之一，是曾经用于牧草或种植的地区，但自然恢复到林地。

The Three-Day Blow

The rain stopped as Nick turned into the road that went up through the orchard.

The fruit had been picked and the fall wind blew through the bare trees.

Nick stopped and picked up a Wagner apple from beside the road,shiny in the brown grass from the rain. He put the apple in the pocket of his Mackinaw coat.

The road came out of the orchard on to the top of the hill.

There was the cottage, the porch bare, smoke coming from the chimney.

In back was the garage, the chickencoop and the second-growth timber like a hedge against the woods behind.

The big trees swayed far over in the wind as he watched.

> ==sway[sweɪ] vi. 摇摆;摆动;摇晃 vt. 影响;使改变看法 n. 影响力;支配;摇摆，摆动==

It was the first of the autumn storms.

As Nick crossed the open field above the orchard the door of the cottage opened and Bill came out. He stood on the porch looking out.

"Well, Wemedge," he said.

"Hey, Bill," Nick said, coming up thesteps.

They stood together, looking out across the country, down over the orchard, beyond the road, across the lower fields and the woods of the point to the lake.

> <font color=red>They stood together, looking out across the country, down over the orchard, beyond the road, across the lower fields and the woods of the point to the lake.</font>

The wind was blowing straight down the lake. They could see the surf along Ten Mile point.

"She's blowing," Nick said.

"She'll blow like that for three days,"Bill said.

"Is your dad in?" Nick said. "No. He’s out with the gun. Come on in."

Nick went inside the cottage. There was a big fire in the fireplace.

The wind made it roar. Bill shut the door.

"Have a drink?" he said.

He went out to the kitchen and came back with two glasses and a pitcher of water.

> ==pitcher[ˈpɪtʃɚ] n. 投手;壶，罐;双柄陶罐==

Nick reached the whisky bottle from the shelf above the fireplace.

"All right?" he said. "Good," said Bill.

They sat in front of the fire and drank the Irish whisky and water.

"It's got a swell, smoky taste," Nick said, and looked at the fire through the glass.

“That’s the peat,” Bill said.

“You can’t get peat into liquor,” Nick said.

“That doesn’t make any difference,” Bill said.

“You ever seen any peat?” Nick asked. “No,” said Bill.

“Neither have I,” Nick said.

His shoes, stretched out on the hearth, began to steam in front of the fire.

“Better take your shoes off,” Bill said. “I haven’t got any socks on.”

“Take them off and dry them and I’ll get you some,” Bill said.

He went upstairs into the loft and Nick heard him walking about overhead.

Upstairs was open under the roof and was where Bill and his father and he, Nick, sometimes slept.

In back was a dressing room. They moved the cots back out of the rain and covered them with rubber blankets.

Bill came down with a pair of heavy wool socks.

"It’s getting too late to go around without socks,” he said.

“I hate to start them again,” Nick said.

He pulled the socks on and slumped back in the chair, putting his feet up on the screen in front of the fire.

“You’ll dent in the screen,” Bill said. Nick swung his feet over to the side of the fireplace.

“Got anything to read?” he asked. “Only the paper.”

“What did the Cards do?” “Dropped a double header to the Giants.”

“That ought to cinch it for them.” “It’s a gift,” Bill said.

“Or he makes them discontented so they have to trade them to him.”

“Like Heinie Zim,” Nick agreed. “That bonehead will do him a lot of good.”

Bill stood up.“He can hit,” Nick offered.

The heat from the fire was baking his legs.

“He’s a sweet fielder, too,” Bill said. “But he loses ball games.”

“Maybe that’s what McGraw wants him for,” Nick suggested.

“Maybe,” Bill agreed.“There’s always more to it than we know about,” Nick said.

Bill reached down the whisky bottle. His big hand went all the way around it.

He poured the whisky into the glassNick held out.

“How much water?” “Just the same.”

He sat down on the floor beside Nick’s chair.

“It’s good when the fall storms come, isn’t it?” Nick said. “It’s swell.”

“It’s the best time of year,” Nick said.

“Wouldn’t it be hell to be in town?” Bill said.

“I’d like to see the World Series,” Nick said.

“Well, they’re always in New York or Philadelphia now,” Bill said.

“That doesn’t do us any good.” “I wonder if the Cards will ever win a pennant?”

“Not in our lifetime,” Bill said. “Gee, they’d go crazy,” Nick said.

“Do you remember when they got going that once before they had the train wreck?”

“Boy!” Nick said, remembering.

Bill reached over to the table under the window for the book that lay there, face down, where he had put it when he went to the door.

He held his glass in one hand and the book in the other, leaning back against Nick’s chair.

“What are you reading?” “Richard Feverel.” “I couldn’t get into it.”

“It’s all right,” Bill said. “It ain’t a badbook, Wemedge.”

“What else have you got I haven’t read?” Nick asked. “Did you read the Forest Lovers?”

“Yup. That’s the one where they go to bed every night with the naked sword between them.”

“That’s a good book, Wemedge.”

“It’s a swell book. What I couldn’t ever understand was what good the sword would do.

It would have to stay edge up all the time because if it went over flat you could roll right over it and it wouldn’t make any trouble.”

“It’s a symbol,” Bill said.“Sure” said Nick, “but it isn’t practical.”

“Did you ever read Fortitude?” “It’s fine,” Nick said.

“That’s a real book. That’s where his old man is after him all the time.Have you got any more by Walpole?”

“The Dark Forest,” Bill said. “It’s about Russia.”

“What does he know about Russia?”Nick asked.

“I don’t know. You can’t ever tell about those guys.

Maybe he was there when he was aboy. He’s got a lot of dope on it.”

“I’d like to meet him,” Nick said.

“I’d like to meet Chesterton,” Bill said.

“I wish he was here now,” Nick said.“We’d take him fishing to the ’Voix tomorrow.”

“I wonder if he’d like to go fishing,” Bill said.

“Sure,” said Nick. “He must be about the best guy there is. Do you remember the Flying Inn?”

“‘If an angel out of heaven gives you something else to drink.

Thank him for his kind intentions; Go and pour them down the sink.’”

“That’s right,” said Nick. “I guess he’s a better guy than Walpole.”

“Oh, he’s a better guy, all right,” Bill said.

"But Walpole’s a better writer." "I don’t know," Nick said.

“Chesterton’s a classic.” “Walpole’s a classic, too,” Bill insisted.

“I wish we had them both here,” Nick said. “We’d take them both fishing to the ’Voix tomorrow.”

“Let’s get drunk,” Bill said.“All right,” Nick agreed.

“My old man won’t care,” Bill said.

“Are you sure?” said Nick.“I know it,” Bill said.

“I’m a little drunk now,” Nick said. “You aren’t drunk,” Bill said.

He got up from the floor and reached for the whisky bottle.

Nick held out his glass. His eyes fixed on it while Bill poured.

Bill poured the glass half full of whisky.

“Put in your own water,” he said. “There’s just one more shot.”

“Got any more?” Nick asked.“There’s plenty more but dad only likes me to drink what’s open.”

“Sure,” said Nick.“He says opening bottles is what makes drunkards,” Bill explained.

“That’s right,” said Nick. He was impressed.

He had never thought of that before.

He had always thought it was solitary drinking that made drunkards.

> 他一向总是认为只有独自喝闷酒才会成为酒鬼呢。
>
> 💧solitary还有“唯一的，仅有的 ”的意思，比如：There was not a solitary shred of evidence (= none at all) .
>
> 一丁点证据都没有。

“How is your dad?” he asked respectfully.

“He’s all right,” Bill said. “He gets a little wild sometimes.”

“He’s a swell guy,” Nick said. He poured water into his glass out of the pitcher.

It mixed slowly with the whisky. There was more whisky than water.

“You bet your life he is,” Bill said. “My old man’s all right,” Nick said. “You’re damn right he is,” said Bill.

“He claims he’s never taken a drink in his life,” Nick said, as though announcing a scientific fact.

“Well, he’s a doctor. My old man’s apainter. That’s different.”

“He’s missed a lot,” Nick said sadly.

“You can’t tell.” Bill said. “Everything’s got its compensations.”

> ==compensation[ˌkɑːmpenˈseɪʃn] n. 补偿费，赔偿金;补偿;报酬==
>
> n. 补偿，使坏的情况变好的事物（things that make a bad situation better）

> 万事有失必有所得。

> 💧compensation还有“赔偿金”的意思，比如：He received one year's salary ascompensation for loss of office.

> 他得到一年的工资作为失业赔偿金。

“He says he’s missed a lot himself,” Nick confessed.

> ==confess[kənˈfes] vt.&vi. 坦白，招认;承认;忏悔==

“Well, dad’s had a tough time,” Bill said. “It all evens up,” Nick said.

They sat looking into the fire and thinking of this profound truth.

“I’ll get a chunk from the back porch,” Nick said.

He had noticed while looking into the fire that the fire was dying down.

Also he wished to show he could hold his liquor and be practical.

Even if his father had never toucheda drop Bill was not going to get him drunk before he himself was drunk.

“Bring one of the big beech chunks,” Bill said. He was also being consciously practical.

**💧****美国职业棒球大联盟**

**Major League Basebal（缩写：MLB）**

我们今天的内容中提到了Nick和Bill围着炉火聊到了美国职业棒球锦标赛（“I’d like to see the World Series,” Nick said. “Well, they’re always in New York or Philadelphia now,” Bill said.）今天我们就一起来了解一下美国职业棒球赛吧～

美国职业棒球大联盟（MLB），是目前世界上最高水准的职业棒球赛事。他共有30支球队，每个球队都在自己的城市有自己的球场。有些历史悠久的球队，球场也同样拥有独特的人文底蕴。球场的周边往往会形成繁华的商业区域，不仅仅是本地球迷享受休闲生活的好去处，也是国外旅游者乐于体验美国文化风韵的地标。

常规的赛季，在每年的4-9月份，遵循着规定的交叉赛程，每支球队要和联盟中大多数的球队交手，162场比赛里有81场在自己的球场（主场 home court），另外81场要去到对手的场地（客场 away ground）。每个对手的系列赛在3-4场左右。

随着常规赛事的推进，MLB会组织球迷根据球员上半段的表现进行网络票选，将自己喜欢的球员选出来组成2支全明星队伍，在8月份常规赛季中期，进行对决。大牌明星球员云集，让你一次看个尽兴。入选全明星赛，对球员来说也是极大的荣誉。

而精彩绝伦的季后赛则是常规赛季中战绩最佳队伍的终极对决。通常在金秋十月进行。也被称为“经典十月”（Classic October），近年由于季后赛环节经常有抢七出现，世界大赛巅峰争冠赛也会被拖进十一月初。但即使初冬的寒风也不会影响到比赛的精彩程度和球迷的激情。

棒球是对身体的条件要求并不太高的运动，更多的是靠智慧和意志。比如打者的选球，捕手的配球，投手的自信程度等等。MLB是一个世界的熔炉，MLB的球员有来自美国本土普通中产的孩子甚至哈佛大学的名校毕业生，也有来自拉美棒球训练营的充满梦想的小球员，古巴的职业球员，日本职业棒球的明星球员等等。

### 课文理解

今天的故事《三日狂风》（*The Three-Day Blow*）是《了却一段情》（*The End of Something*）的续篇。Nick来到山顶上Bill的小屋里（The road came out of the orchard on to the top of the hill. There was the cottage...）而故事开篇，作者就交待了当时的环境——正好是秋天的第一场风暴，为之后的故事发展埋下了伏笔——

💧**Clue 1**: There is the first of the autumn storms.



**Evidence 1**: The big trees swayed far over in the wind as he watched. It was the first of the autumn storms.

那些大树在远方的高处在风中摇摆着。这是秋天的头一场风暴。



**Evidence 2**: The wind was blowing straight down the lake. They could see the surf along Ten Mile point.

“She’s blowing,” Nick said.

“She’ll blow like that for three days,” Bill said.

大风正直扫湖面。他们看得见那十里岬沿岸的浪花。

“在刮风呢。”尼克说。

“这样刮要连刮三天。”比尔说。



Nick和Bill俩人开始有一搭没一搭地聊起天来，从棒球锦标赛到各种书籍和作家，其中提到的许多书本正好也是当时海明威和他的朋友Bill Smith俩人正在读的，主要是英国作家的小说作品。这一段对于许多读者来说会显得无比枯燥，俩人的谈话似乎不着边际，什么都扯上一点，没个看透。但其实海明威写这一段的用意，是渲染俩人之间此刻隐藏的尴尬和紧张的氛围。



在《了却一段情里》，Nick和女朋友分手后并不好过，在河边的树林里，他把Bill呵斥走了（"Oh, go away, Bill! Go away for a while."）而现在俩人都没开口提这件事。有趣的是，Bill一直在不停地让Nick喝酒——



💧**Clue 2**: Bill keeps on getting Nick into more drinks.



**Evidence 1**: “I’m a little drunk now,” Nick said. “You aren’t drunk,” Bill said.

He got up from the floor and reached for the whisky bottle. Nick held out his glass. His eyes fixed on it while Bill poured.

“我现在就有点醉了。”尼克说。“你没醉。”比尔说。

他从地板上站起身，伸手去拿那瓶威士忌。尼克将酒杯伸过来。比尔斟酒时，他两眼直盯着酒杯。



**Evidence 2**: “He’s a swell guy,” Nick said. He poured water into his glass out of the pitcher. It mixed slowly with the whisky. There was more whisky than water.

“他人倒是不坏。”尼克说。他从壶里往自己杯里倒水。水慢慢地同威士忌混在一起了。威士忌比水多。



**Evidence 3**: “I’ll get a chunk from the back porch,” Nick said....Also he wished to show he could hold his liquor and be practical. Even if his father had never touched a drop Bill was not going to get him drunk before he himself was drunk.

“我到后门廊去拿块柴火。”尼克说。他紧盯着炉火时注意到火快熄灭了。同时他也希望表示自己酒量大，头脑还管用。尽管他父亲一生滴酒不沾，但是比尔自己还没醉就休想灌倒他。



在这后，作者还描述了一个细节，Bill也装出了一副自己还没喝醉并且头脑清醒的样子来（“Bring one of the big beech chunks,” Bill said. He was also being consciously practical.）但俩人是否真的完全不受酒精作用的影响呢？在这之后他们对话的焦点又会发生什么转变？在明天故事的下半篇里也会有精彩上演哦~

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****美国的飓风**

 **Hurricane in America**

我们今天的故事发生在秋季的大风天气，这场大风刮了三天。（It was the first of the autumn storms...The wind was blowing straight down the lake...“She’s blowing,” Nick said. “She’ll blow like that for three days,” Bill said.) 今天我们就来一起了解一下美国多发的飓风吧～

“飓风”这个词源自加勒比海语的恶魔Hurican一词，也有说他其实是玛雅人神话中创世众神的其中一位，就是旋风与雷暴之神Hurakan. 美国中南部有很大的平原，当冷气流与暖气流的锋面向与的时候，地面没有足够高的山坡阻挡，所以，锋面的冲击容易扩大成为飓风。从这方面不难看出，美国之所以频繁出现飓风，主要与它的气候条件和地形有非常大的关系。

按世界气象组织定义：热带气旋中心持续风速达到12级，即每秒32.7米或以上，称为台风或飓风。通常人们将发生在东北太平洋和大西洋上的这种热带气旋称为飓风。（而在国际日期变更线以西的海洋上生成的热带气旋则称之为台风，例如中国）飓风依强度分为1至5级，级数越高表明最高持续风速越高，造成的破坏可能越大。

美国人为何谈飓风色变？翻看美国的历史，就会发现上面洒满了与飓风斗争的血与泪。 一般来说，每年的6月至11月是美国的飓风季节，其中8、9月份飓风最为集中。目前，世界气象组织采用了6张飓风命名表，每6年循环一次，而每张表上的名字按照首字母次序排列。如果某些飓风带来的破坏太大，它的名字可能会弃用，被踢出表格。

2017年，在休斯顿，飓风“哈维”过境带来大面积洪水，灾民紧急撤离。

飓风“艾尔玛”登陆美国后引发强风暴雨，佛罗里达州共有630万人收到撤离令，房屋车辆受损严重，还出现大面积停电。在佛罗里达州冬泉市，飓风过后路面塌陷，一辆面包车坠入坑内。

2012年，飓风“桑迪”横扫美国东海岸，带来狂风暴雨、暴雪及洪水灾害，毁坏大量建筑，百余人丧生，数十万人无家可归。在纽约，飓风“桑迪”带来大雨，洪水灌入地下停车场。

2005年，在路易斯安那州新奥尔良，街道被淹没。超级飓风“卡特里娜”登陆新奥尔良，使之成为一座“水城”，而政府的救援不力，更使之成为一座“炼狱”。

The Three-Day Blow

Nick came in with the log through the kitchen and in passing knocked a pan off the kitchen table.

He laid the log down and picked up the pan.

It had contained dried apricots, soaking in water.

He carefully picked up all the apricots off the floor, some of them had gone under the stove, and put them back in the pan.

He dipped some more water onto them from the pail by the table.

He felt quite proud of himself. He had been thoroughly practical.

He came in carrying the log and Bill got up from the chair and helped him put it on the fire.

“That’s a swell log,” Nick said.

“I’d been saving it for the bad weather,” Bill said.

“A log like that will burn all night.” “There’ll be coals left to start the fire in the morning,” Nick said.

“That’s right,” Bill agreed. They were conducting the conversation on a high plane.

“Let’s have another drink,” Nick said.

“I think there’s another bottle open in the locker,” Bill said.

He kneeled down in the corner in front of the locker and brought out asquare-faced bottle.

“It’s Scotch,” he said.“I’ll get some more water,” Nick said.

He went out into the kitchen again. He filled the pitcher with the dipper dipping cold spring water from the pail.

On his way back to the living room he passed a mirror in the dining room and looked in it.

His face looked strange. He smiled at the face in the mirror and it grinned back at him.

He winked at it and went on. It was not his face but it didn’t make any difference. Bill had poured out the drinks.

“That’s an awfully big shot,” Nick said.

“Not for us, Wemedge,” Bill said.

“What’ll we drink to?” Nick asked, holding up the glass.

“Let’s drink to fishing,” Bill said.

“All right,” Nick said. “Gentlemen, I give you fishing.” “All fishing,” Bill said. “Everywhere.”

“Fishing,” Nick said. “That’s what we drink to.” “It’s better than baseball,” Bill said.

“There isn’t any comparison,” said Nick. “How did we ever get talking about baseball?”

“It was a mistake,” Bill said. “Baseball is a game for louts. ”They drank all that was in their glasses.

“Now let’s drink to Chesterton.” “And Walpole,” Nick interposed.

Nick poured out the liquor. Bill poured in the water.

They looked at each other. They felt very fine.

“Gentlemen,” Bill said, “I give you Chesterton and Walpole.” “Exactly, gentlemen,” Nick said.

They drank. Bill filled up the glasses. They sat down in the big chairs in front of the fire.

“You were very wise, Wemedge,” Bill said. “What do you mean?” asked Nick.

“To bust off that Marge business,” Bill said. “I guess so,” said Nick.

“It was the only thing to do. If you hadn’t, by now you’d be back home working trying to get enough money to get married.”

> <font color=red>"If you hadn’t, by now you’d be back home working trying to get enough money to get married."</font>

Nick said nothing. “Once a man’s married he’s absolutely bitched,” Bill went on.

“He hasn’t got anything more. Nothing. Not a damn thing.

He’s done for. You’ve seen the guys that get married.”

Nick said nothing.“You can tell them,” Bill said.

“They get this sort of fat married look. They’re done for.” “Sure,” said Nick.

> <font color=red>“You can tell them,” Bill said. “They get this sort of fat married look. They’re done for.”</font>

>
> ②this sort of fat married look “这种结过婚的傻样儿”；fat在俚语里是“肤浅的，愚蠢的”（empty, stupid）的意思。

“It was probably bad busting it off,” Bill said.

“But you always fall for somebody else and then it’s all right. Fall for them but don’t let them ruin you.”

“Yes,” said Nick.“If you’d have married her you would have had to marry the whole family.

Remember her mother and that guy she married.”Nick nodded.

“Imagine having them around the house all the time and going to Sunday dinners at their house, and having them over to dinner and her telling Marge all the time what to do and how to act.”

Nick sat quiet.“You came out of it damned well,” Bill said.

“Now she can marry somebody of her own sort and settle down and be happy.

You can’t mix oil and water and you can’t mix that sort of thing any more than if I’d marry Ida that works for Strattons. She’d probably like it, too.”

Nick said nothing. The liquor had all died out of him and left him alone.

Bill wasn’t there. He wasn’t sitting infront of the fire or going fishing tomorrow with Bill and his dad or anything.

He wasn’t drunk. It was all gone. All he knew was that he had once had Marjorie and that he had lost her.

She was gone and he had sent her away.

That was all that mattered. He might never see her again.

Probably he never would. It was all gone, finished.

“Let’s have another drink,” Nick said.

Bill poured it out. Nick splashed in alittle water.

“If you’d gone on that way we wouldn’t be here now,” Bill said.

That was true. His original plan had been to go down home and get a job.

Then he had planned to stay in Charlevoix all winter so he could be near Marge.

Now he did not know what he was going to do.

“Probably we wouldn’t even be going fishing tomorrow,” Bill said. “You had the right dope, all right.” “Icouldn’t help it,” Nick said.

“I know. That’s the way it works out,” Bill said.

“All of a sudden everything was over,” Nick said.

"I don’t know why it was. I couldn’t help it.

Just like when the three-day blows come now and rip all the leaves off the trees.”

“Well, it’s over. That’s the point,” Billsaid. “It was my fault,” Nick said.

“It doesn’t make any difference whose fault it was,” Bill said.

“No, I suppose not,” Nick said.

The big thing was that Marjorie was gone and that probably he would never see her again.

He had talked to her about how they would go to Italy together and the fun they would have.

Places they would be together. It was all gone now.

“So long as it’s over that’s all that matters,” Bill said.

“I tell you, Wemedge, I was worried while it was going on.

You played it right. I understand her mother is sore as hell.

She told a lot of people you were engaged.”

> <font color=red>“You played it right. I understand her mother is sore as hell. She told a lot of people you were engaged.”</font>

“We weren’t engaged,” Nick said. “Itwas all around that you were.”

“I can’t help it,” Nick said. “We weren’t.” “Weren’t you going to get married?” Bill asked.

“Yes. But we weren’t engaged,” Nick said.

“What’s the difference?” Bill asked judicially.

> ==judicially英 [dʒʊ'dɪʃəlɪ] 美 [dʒʊ'dɪʃəlɪ] adv. 依法判决地，公平地==

“I don’t know. There’s a difference.”

“I don’t see it,” said Bill.

“All right,” said Nick. “Let’s get drunk.”

“All right,” Bill said. “Let’s get really drunk.”

“Let’s get drunk and then go swimming,” Nick said. He drank off his glass.

“I’m sorry as hell about her but whatcould I do?” he said.

“You know what her mother was like!” “She was terrible,” Bill said.

“All of a sudden it was over,” Nick said. “I oughtn’t to talk about it.”

“You aren’t,” Bill said. “I talked about it and now I’m through. We won’t ever speak about it again.

You don’t want to think about it. You might get back into it again.”

Nick had not thought about that. It had seemed so absolute.

That was a thought. That made him feel better.

“Sure,” he said. “There’s always thatdanger.”

He felt happy now. There was not anything that was irrevocable.

> <font color=red>irrevocable英 [ɪˈrevəkəbl] 美 [ɪˈrɛvəkəbəl] adj. 不可更改的，不可撤回的</font>

He might go into town Saturday night. Today was Thursday.

“There’s always a chance,” he said.

“You’ll have to watch yourself,” Bill said. “I’ll watch myself,” he said.

He felt happy. Nothing was finished.Nothing was ever lost.

He would go into town on Saturday.

He felt lighter, as he had felt before Bill started to talk about it. There was always a way out.

“Let’s take the guns and go down tothe point and look for your dad,” Nick said. “All right.”

Bill took down the two shotguns from the rack on the wall.

He opened a box of shells. Nick puton his Mackinaw coat and his shoes.

His shoes were stiff from the drying.He was still quite drunk but his head was clear.

“How do you feel?” Nick asked.

“Swell. I’ve just got a good edge on.” Bill was buttoning up his sweater.

> <font color=red>“Swell. I’ve just got a good edge on.” Bill was buttoning up his sweater.</font>

> I’ve just got a good edge on “我只是刚有点醉意罢了”；on edge 有“紧张，不安”的意思（being tense, nervous, and unable to relax）, 比如： My nerves were constantly on edge.（我的神经处于不断紧张中。）因此这里的got a good edge on可以理解为“精神感觉紧张的”，因为在这之前Bill和Nick的谈话几乎快到争吵的份上了，也可以延伸为“有醉意的”（Bill为自己态度不佳的找的说辞）。

“There’s no use getting drunk.” “No. We ought to get outdoors.”

They stepped out the door. The wind was blowing a gale.

“The birds will lie right down in the grass with this,” Nick said.

They struck down toward the orchard.

“I saw a woodcock this morning,” Bill said. “Maybe we’ll jump him,” Nick said.

“You can’t shoot in this wind,” Bill said.

Outside now the Marge business was no longer so tragic.

It was not even very important. The wind blew everything like that away.

“It’s coming right off the big lake,” Nick said. Against the wind they heard the thud of a shotgun.

“That’s dad,” Bill said. “He’s down inthe swamp.”

“Let’s cut down that way,” Nick said.

“Let’s cut across the lower meadow and see if we jump anything,” Bill said. “All right,” Nick said.

None of it was important now. The wind blew it out of his head.

Still he could always go into town Saturday night. It was a good thing to have in reserve.

**💧****Hunting in America**

**美国狩猎文化** 

我们今天的内容中有这样的场景：Nick和Bill聊天过后，拿着抢去找Bill正在狩猎的父亲。（“Let’s take the guns and go down to the point and look for your dad,” Nick said. “All right.” Bill took down the two shotguns from the rack on the wall. He opened a box of shells...) 我们今天一起来了解一下美国的狩猎文化吧～

美国狩猎文化起源于欧洲移民（immigrant）最初抵达北美洲，以野外打猎方式寻求温饱。发展到如今，“狩猎”在美国已成为带有平民化的休闲运动。上至总统（罗斯福总统就是著名的“狩猎人”）下至百姓，大家都能同等享受狩猎带来的乐趣。

在美国狩猎合法并不意味着可任意狩猎，而是有着很严格的法律限制：需在规定的时间、地点里打猎指定种类和数量的野兽，如若违法狩猎，将受到严重的处罚（罚款甚至牢狱之灾都有可能）。另一方面，从科学角度证实，狩猎有助于自然界的生态平衡，只要合法狩猎，环保人士也很少上诉狩猎行为。

猎人必须把猎物带回，或食用其肉，或使用其皮毛。到猎场滥杀，置猎物横尸野地，肆意浪费野生资源，不管有无猎证都属非法；但所有渔猎所获，从皮肉肢体到内脏都只能自家或送亲友享用，有任何商业行为谋利，属重罪非法。

美国对于申购打猎执照资格的控管，各州有松有紧，申购了打猎执照之后，除了可以按相关规定猎野兔、松鼠等小动物之外，其他如飞鸟、水禽、及各种大型猎物（Big Game），都还须加购许可证、贴章与猎签。

猎棕熊则是在北美州算危险性最高的狩猎，一般在阿拉斯加雇用有执照向导追猎，狩猎方式有徒步追踪，驾雪地摩托车追猎，也可乘小飞机或船寻猎。该州的滨海区域巨型棕熊，可重达千磅，高达3米，是美国与国际顶尖猎人的梦幻猎物（Dream Game）.

外国人到美国狩猎，目前问题的是很难把猎枪带进美国。一般必须有熟悉打猎的亲友带领，使用他们的猎枪猎具；或寻人安排聘专业向导或到猎场，借用或租用他们的猎枪实现到美国的打猎梦。

美国狩猎地点Top5推荐：

\1. Appleton, Wisconsin,威斯康星州的阿普尔顿，Boone和Crockett俱乐部将其授予美国白尾鹿打猎最好的地点。

\2. Vassalboro, Maine，缅因州Vassalboro在国家南部提供一流的火鸡射击场所。

\3. Lake Umbagog, New Hampshire,新罕布什尔州的Umbagog湖是狩猎鸭，鹅，乌鸦，wood鹬，熊，白尾鹿，驼鹿和土狼的一个主要场所。

\4. Wilson Hill, New York，纽约威尔逊山提供水禽狩猎，也可以进行鹿和小型狩猎。如果你喜欢打雉鸡，那个地区在秋天有很多。

\5. West Virginia's Charleston-Beckley corridor，西弗吉尼亚州的查尔斯顿- 贝克利走廊，在弓和步枪狩猎季节可以猎到熊。在那里，还可以猎到最好的鹿和松鼠。

### 课文理解

Nick和Bill继续喝酒的过程中，Bill终于主动提起Nick和女友分手的话题，并且表示了自己对Nick的支持和赞同。Bill有强烈的对婚姻的反对和厌恶，在他看来，婚姻足以摧毁一个男人——

💧**Clue 1**: Bill thinks that marriage ruins a man.

**Evidence 1**: “You were very wise, Wemedge,” Bill said.

“What do you mean?” asked Nick.

“To bust off that Marge business,” Bill said.

“你非常聪明，威米奇。”比尔说。

“你什么意思？”尼克说。

“把跟玛吉的那段关系了断啦。”比尔说。



**Evidence 2**:  “Once a man’s married he’s absolutely bitched,” Bill went on. “He hasn’t got anything more. Nothing. Not a damn thing. He’s done for. You’ve seen the guys that get married.”

“男人一旦结了婚就彻底完蛋啦。”比尔继续说。“他什么都没有了。一无所有。屁也没有。他玩儿完了。你见过结了婚的男人嘛。”



对于Bill的这番慷慨陈词，Nick虽然嘴上应和，但独自一人的时候依然对和Marge分手感到伤痛和后悔——



💧**Clue 2**: Nick is painful about his break-up with Marge.



**Evidence 1**: It was all gone. All he knew was that he had once had Marjorie and that he had lost her. She was gone and he had sent her away. That was all that mattered.

这一切全过去了。他只知道自己从前跟玛乔丽好过，后来失去了她。她走了，是他打发她走的。这是一切的关键。



**Evidence 2**: His original plan had been to go down home and get a job. Then he had planned to stay in Charlevoix all winter so he could be near Marge. Now he did not know what he was going to do.

他原来的计划是回家去找份活儿。后来计划整个冬天都留在夏勒伏瓦，这样可以亲近玛吉。现在他可不知道自己该做什么了。



但是作者并没有让故事以Nick的无措和伤感结尾，而是安排了一个转折。在Bill的提醒下，他想到了自己总会再遇见喜欢的女孩。（“There’s always a chance,” he said. “You’ll have to watch yourself,” Bill said. “I’ll watch myself,” he said. He felt happy. Nothing was finished.）



Nick的心境转移也和这三天的大风形成了呼应（None of it was important now. The wind blew it out of his head.）狂风似乎把他对这件事情的残念都刮走了，他也突然地兴奋了起来。这个结尾其实也留下了一个矛盾，甚至可以说是悖论。Nick一方面主动和Marge分手后无法摆脱空虚和痛苦，另一方面又盲目地期待着也许还有新的感情机会。这也可以说是一种非常不成熟的感情观。

**💧****Fishing in Different Countries**

**各国钓鱼趣味文化**



我们今天的内容中Nick和Bill在闲聊中提到了他们喜欢的娱乐方式：钓鱼，并以钓鱼祝酒。（“What’ll we drink to?” Nick asked, holding up the glass. “Let’s drink to fishing,” Bill said. “All right,” Nick said. “Gentlemen, I give you fishing.” “All fishing,” Bill said. “Everywhere.”）其实钓鱼在世界各国有着各种有趣的方式～

\1. 德国－－钓鱼要考证

在德国如果想要去钓鱼，必须到专门的培训学校学习，通过考试之后会颁发一本有效期为五年的钓鱼执照。凡是是去钓鱼必须带着钓鱼执照，持证上岗，否则被抓到的话要受到处罚的。不过，这个规定只是针对德国人，对于外国游客却不需要，但是也要注意文明垂钓。

\2. 丹麦－－钓鱼带尺子

丹麦位于北欧，地处北海与波罗的海之间，是一个半岛国家，因为它有广阔的海岸线，海产资源非常丰富，是世界四大渔业国之一。在丹麦，人们到海边钓鱼，除了带通常的钓鱼工具外，工具袋中还有一把尺子，原因是丹麦政府发布了一条法令，凡是身长不满22 cm的鱼，一律禁止捕捞。

\3. 新西兰－－钓鱼放风筝

号称“钓鱼天堂”的新西兰流行风筝钓鱼法。风筝钓鱼最大的优势就是风筝可以把钓线带到几百米开外，而岸边甩钩高手也只能甩几十米远。原理是，风筝把附有诱饵和浮子的钓线送几百米外的水域。钓线会随着风筝的升降，在水中上下起落。一旦有鱼上钩，钓线因受到鱼的牵引，便会从风筝的夹子上滑落下来，浮子则漂浮在海水中。然后钓鱼人捡起鱼线，就能把钓在钩上的鱼拉上岸。

\4. 日本－－钓鱼不摘钩

日本是世界钓鱼大国，全国约有3100多万钓鱼爱好者。日本人钓鱼很少从鱼的嘴里取下渔钩，这是为防止不小心手被渔钩划破或被锋利的鱼鳍刺伤，尤其是为预防身上长刺的有毒鱼。此外，从鱼口中取钩不仅麻烦，而且还贻误垂钓时间。因此，他们钓到鱼后，会立即用剪子剪断引线。这就要求他们在钓鱼前要准备很多绑好子线的钓钩，麻利换上钓钩后接着开始钓鱼。日本人办事历来既讲安全又讲效率，钓鱼自然也不例外。

\5. 韩国－－钓鱼搭炉子

韩国济州岛沿岸海阔水深，鱼儿很多，岸边筑有长长的防波大堤，是垂钓的好去处。每当太阳西斜时，会有许多举家而来的垂钓者。丈夫忙着投竿钓鱼，妻子与孩子们则找块平坦地方铺上塑料布，支起专用小炉子等鱼下锅。垂钓者一般五分钟左右就可钓上鱼来，一家人围坐在一起，吃着烧好的鲜鱼和带来的食品，喝着啤酒或饮料，其惬意不言而喻。

虽然钓鱼方法各式各样，但是这些钓鱼人有一个共同点，就是穿着上都喜欢穿一件钓鱼马甲。这种马甲有许多大小不一的口袋，钓鱼的渔具本就多，一般钓鱼都不会另外背包，马甲的多口袋可以防止手机、钱包、证件、水壶小物件和各种鱼线、鱼饵、渔具盒存放、拿去都非常方便。马甲上的D型挂环、环形织带等可以挂剪刀、鱼钩、鱼漂等，专业的还有设置鱼竿放置槽。

Mr. And Mrs. Elliot

Mr. and Mrs. Elliot tried very hard to have a baby.

They tried as often as Mrs. Elliot could stand it.

They tried in Boston after they were married and they tried coming over on the boat.

They did not try very often on the boat because Mrs. Elliot was quite sick.

She was sick and when she was sick she was sick as Southern women are sick.

That is women from the Southern part of the United States.

Like all Southern women Mrs. Elliot disintegrated very quickly under sea sickness, travelling at night, and getting up too early in the morning.

Hubert Elliot was taking postgraduate work in law at Harvardwhen he was married.

He was a poet with an income of nearly ten thousand dollars a year.He wrote very long poems very rapidly.

He was twenty-five years old and had never gone to bed with a woman until he married Mrs. Elliot.

He wanted to keep himself pure so that he could bring to his wife the same purity of mind and body that he expected of her.

He had been in love with various girls before he kissed Mrs. Elliot and always told them sooner or later that he had led a clean life.

He once tried to warn a girl he knew against a man of whom he had almost proof that he had been a rotter at college and a very unpleasant incident had resulted.

Mrs. Elliot’s name was Cornelia. She had taught him to call her Calutina, which was her family nickname in the South.

His mother cried when he brought Cornelia home after their marriage but brightened very much when she learned they were going to live abroad.

Cornelia had said, “You dear sweet boy,” and held him closer than ever when he had told her how he had kept himself clean for her.

Cornelia was pure too. “Kiss me again like that,” she said.

Hubert explained to her that he had learned that way of kissing from hearing a fellow tell a story once.

He was delighted with his experiment and they developed it as far as possible.

Sometimes when they had been kissing together a long time, Cornelia would ask him to tell her again that he had kept himself really straight for her.

The declaration always set her off again. At first Hubert had no idea of marrying Cornelia. He had never thought of her that way.

She had been such a good friend ofhis, and then one day in the little back room of the shop they had been dancing to the gramophone while her girl friend was in the front of the shop and she had looked up into his eyes and he had kissed her.

He could never remember just when it was decided that they were to be married.

But they were married. They spent the night of the day they were married in a Boston hotel.

They were both disappointed but finally Cornelia went to sleep.

Hubert could not sleep and several times went out and walked up and down the corridor of the hotel in his new Jaeger bathrobe that he had bought for his wedding trip.

As he walked he saw all the pairs of shoes, small shoes and big shoes, outside the doors of the hotel rooms.

This set his heart to pounding and he hurried back to his own room but Cornelia was asleep.

He did not like to waken her and soon everything was quite all right and he slept peacefully.

The next day they called on his mother and the next day they sailed for Europe.

It was possible to try to have a baby but Cornelia could not attempt it very often although they wanted a baby more than anything else in the world.

They landed at Cherbourg and came to Paris. They tried to have a baby in Paris.

Then they decided to go to Dijon where there was summer school and where a number of people who crossed on the boat with them had gone.

They found there was nothing to do in Dijon.

Hubert, however, was writing a great number of poems and Cornelia typed them for him.

They were all very long poems. He was very severe about mistakes and would make her re-do an entirepage if there was one mistake.

She cried a good deal and they tried several times to have a baby before they left Dijon.

They came to Paris and most of their friends from the boat came back too.

They were tired of Dijon and anyway would now be able to say that after leaving Harvard or Columbia or Wabash they had studied at the University of Dijon down in the Côte d’Or.

Many of them would have preferred to go to Languedoc, Montpellier or Perpignan if there are universities there.

But all those places are too far away. Dijon is only four and a half hours from Paris and there is a diner on the train.

So they all sat around the Café du Dome, avoiding the Rotonde across the street because it is always so full of foreigners, for a few days andthen the Elliots rented a château in Touraine through an advertisement in the New York Herald.

Elliot had a number of friends by now all of whom admired his poetry and Mrs. Elliot had prevailed upon him to send over to Boston for her girl friend who had been in the tea shop.

Mrs. Elliot became much brighter after her girl friend came and they had many good cries together.

The girl friend was several years older than Cornelia and called her Honey.

She too came from a very old Southern family.

The three of them, with several of Elliot’s friends who called him Hubie, went down to the château in Touraine.

They found Touraine to be a very flat hot country very much like Kansas.

Elliot had nearly enough poems for a book now.

He was going to bring it out in Boston and had already sent his check to, and made a contract with, a publisher.

In a short time the friends began to drift back to Paris.

Touraine had not turned out the way it looked when it started.

Soon all the friends had gone off with a rich young and unmarried poet to a seaside resort near Trouville.

There they were all very happy. Elliot kept on at the château in Touraine because he had taken it for all summer.

He and Mrs. Elliot tried very hard to have a baby in the big hot bedroomon the big, hard bed.

Mrs. Elliot was learning the touch system on the typewriter, but she found that while it increased the speed it made more mistakes.

The girl friend was now typing practically all of the manuscripts.

She was very neat and efficient andseemed to enjoy it.

Elliot had taken to drinking white wine and lived apart in his own room.

He wrote a great deal of poetry during the night and in the morning looked very exhausted.

Mrs. Elliot and the girl friend now slept together in the big medieval bed. They had many a good cry together.

> ==medieval英 [ˌmediˈi:vl] 美 [ˌmidiˈivəl] adj. 中世纪的==

In the evening they all sat at dinner together in the garden under a plane tree and the hot evening windblew and Elliot drank white wine and Mrs. Elliot and the girl friend made conversation and they were all quite happy.

### 背景知识

**💧****Medieval Furniture**

**中世纪风格家具**

我们今天的内容中提到了艾略特夫人和女伴同睡一张中世纪的大床。（Mrs. Elliot and the girl friend now slept together in the big medieval bed. ）那么中世纪风格的家具都是什么样子的呢？

中世纪是欧洲历史上的一个时代，由西罗马帝国灭亡（公元476年）直到文艺复兴时期（公元1453年）。这一千年的历史中形成了融合希伯来文化、日耳曼文化、古希腊、古罗马文化为一体的基督教文明。

人们通常将这个时期的艺术，分为三个形式：即拜占庭艺术、仿罗马式艺术和哥特式艺术。中世纪前期的家具风格以拜占庭式和罗马式为主流。到了12世纪后半叶，中世纪的代表哥特式家具风靡整个欧洲大陆，人们的视野被引向天空，垂直耸立的哥特式风格被广泛地引入到建筑和家具设计中。

\1. 拜占庭式家具（Byzantine Style Furniture）

受到基督教影响，拜占庭家具的装饰图案常用象征基督教的十字架符号，或在花冠藤蔓之间夹杂着天使、圣徒以及各种鸟兽、果实和叶饰图案。由于当时崇尚奢华生活，拜占庭家具装饰形式与过去相比更为华美。

家具在雕刻和镶嵌装饰上十分精细，常常将象牙雕刻的板面用于椅子、小箱、圣骨箱、门等重要的装饰部位，或作为镶嵌形式来点缀家具。在贮藏家具中大多以木材为主（solid wood furniture）形式上精心制作，同时，金、银、青铜饰件也常见于家具的装饰表现上。

拜占庭家具还融入了波斯、伊斯兰、甚至中国的影响，其特征为制作精巧的轴柱、X框架的座椅、圆形或半圆形餐桌、篷盖式睡床、可开合的橱柜以及精心装饰的衣箱。此外，由于丝织业的兴盛，家具的衬垫装饰和室内壁挂以及帷幔等饰物得到了很快的发展，部分丝织品以动物图案为装饰，明显地表露出波斯王朝的特异风格。

\2. 罗马式家具（Romanesque Furniture）

木材是罗马式家具的主要用材，除了松木等低档木材以外，常用的有胡桃木、橡木、欧洲椴木与栗木。此外，铜、铁、象牙、珍珠母等也常用于罗马式家具中。中世纪的整个欧洲家具制作技术发展较慢，家具连接主要靠榫卯接合、钉接合以及铁件的加固作用。罗马式家具方正、笨重，结构简洁，几乎所有支撑构件采用垂直的车木构件，橱柜采用中欧流行的拱顶形。

罗马式家具可以说是罗马式建筑的缩写，其主要标志是采用古罗马建筑的拱券和檐帽、柱子等作为家具构件的表面装饰手法，家具粗犷。但由于罗马文化的优秀遗产大部分在战火中焚毁，此时的家具无论从造型上还是从制作工艺上看明显带有北方条顿民族的粗野形态。

\3. 哥特式家具（Gothic Furniture）

哥特式艺术，始于12世纪的法国，盛行于13世纪，至14世纪末期，其风格逐渐大众化和自然化，成为国际哥特风格。在这一时期木材仍然是制作家具的主要用材。整个欧洲以橡木为主，法国、西班牙和意大利也用胡桃木，欧洲中部和黑海地区用金高松木等软质木材。也有坐具采用金属制作，使用时表面铺上软垫和织物。锁、合页等装饰五金用铁制作，采用敲打、透雕工艺。

哥特式家具从造型、装饰题材到制作工艺直接受到哥特式建筑风潮的影响。家具造型以垂直线条强调垂直庄重的形态，采用尖顶、尖拱、卷叶拱、棂花格、束柱以及浮雕等装饰，给人以刚直、挺拔、严谨的感受。

### 课文理解

今天的故事以一对夫妇为主角，男方是哈佛的高材生，年仅25岁，而女方则已40岁。小说开篇即交待俩人一直想要生一个孩子，但始终没有成功，接下来的情节都围绕着这条主线展开。首先Mr. Elliot在婚前一直保持童身，因为在他看来，只要维持自己的纯洁，就能够获得一段完美的婚姻关系——

💧**Clue 1**: Mr. Elliot thinks that keeping himself sexually pure will be the basis of a perfect relationship.



**Evidence 1**: He wanted to keep himself pure so that he could bring to his wife the same purity of mind and body that he expected of her.

他要保持童身，这样能将纯洁的心灵和身体给予妻子，而他对她也有着同样的期望。



**Evidence 2**:  Cornelia had said, “You dear sweet boy,” and held him closer than ever when he had told her how he had kept himself clean for her. Cornelia was pure too.

他告诉妻子，自己为了她而保持洁身自好，科妮莉娅便称他“亲爱的小宝贝”，还把他搂得格外紧。科妮莉娅也是纯洁的。



但是Mr. Elliot并没有获得期望的完美婚姻生活，他甚至连在和妻子结婚的时候都不是完全自主情愿的（At first Hubert had no idea of marrying Cornelia. He had never thought of her that way...He could never remember just when it was decided that they were to be married. But they were married.）而Mrs. Elliot在这段关系中也并不快乐——



💧**Clue 2**: Mrs. Elliot is also unhappy with her marriage.



**Evidence 1**: Hubert, however, was writing a great number of poems and Cornelia typed them for him. They were all very long poems. He was very severe about mistakes and would make her re-do an entire page if there was one mistake.

幸而休伯特正在写诗，写了好多，科妮莉娅在帮他打字。那些诗全都很长。他又很严格，绝不允许打错，要是有一个差错，就要她把整整一页重打。她哭过好几次，在离开第戎前，他俩几次三番试着怀上孩子。



**Evidence 2**: Elliot had taken to drinking white wine and lived apart in his own room. He wrote a great deal of poetry during the night and in the morning looked very exhausted. Mrs. Elliot and the girl friend now slept together in the big medieval bed. They had many a good cry together.

此时，艾略特喝上了白葡萄酒，独自住在另一间房中。他熬夜写了好多诗，早晨显得精疲力竭。艾略特太太和女友现在同睡在那只中世纪的大床上。她俩抱住了哭过好几回。



这篇小说在表面上探讨的是“不孕不育”（sterility）的话题，但也有人认为，这恰恰象征着“迷惘的一代”精神贫瘠的状态——竭力寻找满足感但无从获得（They search for an undefined sense of fulfillment, but never find it）. 也有人认为，Elliot夫妇的名字其实是在向美国诗人T. S. Elliot致敬，他创作的《荒原》（The Waste Land）是当时展现西方一代人精神上幻灭的经典之作。

**💧****Why Do Some People Feel Sick on Boat or Car？**

**为什么有些人会晕船和晕车呢？**



我们今天的内容中Eliot晕船的情节的描写。（They did not try very often on the boat because Mrs. Elliot was quite sick. She was sick and when she was sick she was sick as Southern women are sick. ）我们今天就来科普一下为什么有些人会晕船和晕车又有哪些小妙招能克服晕船和晕车吧～

从医学上说，晕车、晕船和晕机统称为晕动病，这个病虽不属疑难杂症，但是由于症状令人非常难受，晕车除了和人体个体差异有关系以外，主要和人体的前庭平衡器官这个平衡系统有关系。



许多人想不到这与人的耳朵有关。一般来说，人产生眩晕感主要是因为内耳、眼睛、小脑处于不正常状态造成的。至于晕车，耳部前庭神经功能紊乱是它产生的主因。人的耳朵生理构造分为外耳、中耳、内耳。其中内耳嵌在骨头里，在内耳中有一套调节人体平衡功能的器官，医学术语称为“前庭器官”。前庭是维持人体平衡的一个很重要的器官，它可以感受到人体头位、体位的变化，可以随时调整人身体的姿势，达到身体平衡。



当人们坐船或坐车时，身体经常会产生突然的变向运动，或者在竖直方向上突然变化，就会使前庭器变得不稳定，与此同时，人们眼睛看到情景也对大脑产生刺激，于是，眼睛耳朵向大脑发出不一样的指令，大脑就感到不对了，这时，大脑会发出警告，让人们感觉晕乎乎的，并且想通过呕吐来缓解这种状态的不一致。



此外，如果运行中有一些异常感觉以及运动过程中的一些特殊情况往往会加强晕车的表现，比如在车里觉得不舒服，或者周围的空气不好，或者在运行过程中经常遇到一些复杂的交通情况，都会对前庭器产生一些频繁的刺激。



那么晕车该如何预防呢？

\1. 不要在乘车、船、飞机前吃得太饱，也不要挨饿，尽可能提早吃些易消化食物，不要吃油腻食品。

\2. 应找颠簸不那么厉害的座位，如前两三排座位，眼望前方。

\3. 尽量打开窗门吸取新鲜空气。

\4. 乘船尽量要选较大的船，避免乘小船。

\5. 如有需要，准备一些如苯海拉明片等抗晕动药品，最迟应在乘车前30分钟服用。

\6. 可以听听收音机或和别人聊天、玩耍以分散注意力。

\7. 回忆美好的时光和高兴的往事有利抑制晕动病的症状。



推荐几个的实用小偏方：



\1. 嚼块生姜

生姜的辛辣味道能抑制恶心呕吐的感觉。需要提醒的是，姜会让血液变得稀薄，如果你在服用降血压的药物，一定要事先咨询医生。



\2. 带个橘子

乘车前1小时左右,将新鲜橘皮表面朝外,向内对折,然后对准两鼻孔两手指挤压,皮中便会喷射也带芳香味的油雾。可吸入10余次,乘车途中也照此法随时吸闻。



\3. 按手腕

如果感到胃部不适，恶心想吐，可用大拇指在手腕内侧折痕下方5厘米处的内关穴，按压几分钟，晕车症状就能减轻。



\4. 涂风油精

乘车途中，将风油精搽于太阳穴或风池穴。亦可滴两滴风油精于肚脐眼处，并用伤湿止痛膏敷盖。



\5. 盯住车外一点

适宜轻微的头晕眼花和呕吐。如果眼睛盯住车辆内部的物体，大脑就会收到“没有移动”的信号，使内耳和大脑不同步，进而出现头晕。此时可以盯住车外一个固定不动的点 (如远处的高楼)，这样能让内耳和大脑保持同步，缓解头晕。

Cat in the Rain

There were only two Americans stopping at the hotel.

They did not know any of the people they passed on the stairs on their way to and from their room.

Their room was on the second floor facing the sea.

It also faced the public garden and war monument.

There were big palms and green benches in the public garden.

In the good weather there was always an artist with his easel.

Artists liked the way the palms grew and the bright colors of the hotels facing the sea.

Italians came from a long way off to look up at the war monument.

It was made of bronze and glistened in the rain. It was raining.

"Don't get wet," he said.The wife went downstairs and the hotel owner stood up and bowed to her as she passed the office.

His desk was at the far end of the office. He was an old man and very tall.

"Il piove," the wife said. She liked the hotelkeeper.

"Si, si, Signora, brutto tempo. It is very bad weather."

He stood behind his desk in the far end of the dim room.

The wife liked him. She liked the way he wanted to serve her.

She liked the way he felt about being a hotel-keeper. She liked his old, heavy face and big hands.

Liking him she opened the door and looked out. It was raining harder.

A man in a rubber cape was crossing the empty square to the cafe.

The cat would be around to the right. Perhaps she could go along to the eaves.

> ==eave英 [i:v] 美 [i:v] n. 屋檐==

As she stood in the doorway an umbrella opened behind her. It was the maid who looked after their room.

"You must not get wet," she smiled, speaking Italian. Of course, the hotel-keeper had sent her.

With the maid holding the umbrella over her, she walked along the gravel path until she was under their window.

The table was there, washed bright green in the rain, but the cat was gone.

She was suddenly disappointed. The maid looked up at her.

"Ha perduto qualque cosa, Signora?" "There was a cat," said the American girl.

"A cat?""Si, il gatto.""A cat?" the maid laughed. "A cat in the rain?"

"Yes," she said, "under the table." Then, "Oh, I wanted it so much. I wanted a kitty."When she talked English the maid's face tightened.

"Come, Signora," she said. "We must get back inside. You will be wet."

"I suppose so," said the American girl.

They went back along the gravel path and passed in the door.

The maid stayed outside to close the umbrella.

As the American girl passed the office, the padrone bowed from his desk.

Something felt very small and tight inside the girl.

She went on up the stairs. She opened the door of the room. George was on the bed reading.

"Did you get the cat?" he asked, putting the book down.

"It was gone.""Wonder where it wentto," he said, resting his eyes from reading.

She sat down on the bed."I wanted it so much," she said.

"I don't know why I wanted it so much. I wanted that poor kitty. It isn't any fun to be a poor kitty out in the rain."

George was reading again.She wentover and sat in front of the mirror of the dressing table looking at herself with the hand glass.

She studied her profile, first one side and then the other.

> ==profile英 [ˈprəʊfaɪl] 美 [ˈproʊfaɪl] n. 侧面，侧影；简介；外形，轮廓==

Then she studied the back of her head and her neck.

"Don't you think it would be a good idea if I let my hair grow out?" she asked, looking at her profile again.

George looked up and saw the back of her neck, clipped close like a boy's.

"I like it the way it is.""I get so tired of it," she said. "I get so tired of looking like a boy."

George shifted his position in the bed. He hadn't looked away from her since she started to speak.

"You look pretty darn nice," he said.

She laid the mirror down on the dresser and went over to the window and looked out. It was getting dark.

"I want to pull my hair back tight and smooth and make a big knot at the back that I can feel," she said.

"I want to have a kitty to sit on my lap and purr when I stroke her."

"Yeah?" George said from the bed.

"And I want to eat at a table with my own silver and I want candles.

And I want it to be spring and I want to brush my hair out in front of a mirror and I want a kitty and I want some new clothes."

"Oh, shut up and get something to read," George said. He was reading again.

His wife was looking out of the window. It was quite dark now and still raining in the palm trees.

"Anyway, I want a cat," she said, "I want a cat. I want a cat now.

If I can't have long hair or any fun, Ican have a cat."

George was not listening. He was reading his book.

His wife looked out of the window where the light had come on in the square.

Someone knocked at the door.

"Avanti," George said. He looked upfrom his book. In the doorway stoodthe maid.

She held a big tortoise-shell cat pressed tight against her and swung down against her body.

> tortoise-shell cat 玳瑁猫，龟甲纹毛猫（a cat having black and cream and yellowish markings)名字来源于海龟的一种——玳瑁，因其皮毛颜色与海龟玳瑁非常相似，故称为玳瑁猫。玳瑁猫的名称是由“玳瑁色猫”简化而来的，因此玳瑁猫并不是猫的一个品种，只是对一种颜色的猫的统称，是黑、黄、白三种颜色混杂的猫。

"Excuse me," she said, "the padrone asked me to bring this for the Signora."

### 背景知识

**💧****The Monuments around the World**

**世界上令人惊叹的纪念碑**

我们今天的内容中描写到一对美国夫妇住的酒店房间正对着战争纪念碑，许多意大利人远道而来就是为了看这座战争纪念碑。（Their room was on the second floor facing the sea. It also faced the public garden and war monument...Italians came from a long way off to look up at the war monument. It was made of bronze and glistened in the rain.)



纪念碑是为了纪念一个人或重要的事件而建立的一种结构，或者是作为他们纪念历史时期或文化遗产的一部分，或者仅仅是历史建筑的一个例子。每一种文化纪念碑都是具有多种含义的象征，它可以代表一个时代、一个地区、一个信仰、一个文化、一个国家或一个城市。每一种建筑都讲述着自己的故事，今天我们来感受一下世界上一些恢弘的纪念碑吧～



\1. 印度泰姬陵（Taj Mahal）

泰姬陵是印度最受欢迎的旅游景点，被誉为“印度明珠”。1631年由莫卧儿皇帝沙贾汗修建，以纪念他的妻子去世后。该纪念碑位于阿格拉，每年吸引了阿格拉两倍的人口。1983年，泰姬陵被宣布为世界遗产，它代表了莫卧儿建筑成就的高峰，被评选为“世界新七大奇迹”。这栋建筑至今仍然像当初建造时那样宏伟，被认为是世界上最完美的建筑作品之一。



\2. 里约热内卢基督像（Cristo Redentor）

也叫巴西基督像，是一座装饰艺术风格的大型耶稣基督雕像，位于巴西的里约热内卢基督山上，是该市的标志，也是世界最闻名的纪念雕塑之一。落成于1931年，总高38米，体积庞大，有1145吨重，左右手的指间距达到了23米。雕像中的耶稣基督身着长袍，双臂平举，深情地俯瞰山下里约热内卢市的美丽全景，预示着博爱的精神和对独立的赞许。耶稣像面向着碧波荡漾的大西洋，张开着的双臂从远处望去，就像一个巨大的十字架，显得庄重、威严。



\3. 美国拉什莫尔山国家纪念公园（Mount Rushmore National Memorial）

俗称美国总统山、美国总统公园，拉什莫尔山国家纪念碑是史诗般的比例独特的地标。20世纪30年代，雕刻在南达科他州的花岗岩中，纪念碑描绘了一些国家历史上伟大的总统的面孔：乔治·华盛顿，托马斯·杰斐逊，西奥多·罗斯福和亚伯拉罕·林肯，这四位总统被认为代表了美国建国150年来的历史。



\4. 雅典卫城（Acropolis）

雅典卫城是希腊最杰出的古建筑群，是综合性的公共建筑，为宗教政治的中心地，也是世界上最著名的纪念碑之一。被称为雅典的“阿克罗波利斯”，原意为“高处的城市”或“高丘上的城邦”。它是古希腊文化中最重要的参考点，也是雅典城本身的象征，它代表了公元前5世纪艺术发展的顶峰。在佩里克尔的黄金时代，古希腊文明以一种理想的方式出现在山上，一些建筑杰作被竖立在它的地面上。



\5.  柬埔寨吴哥城（Angkor Thom）

吴哥城是一个有城墙的城市，是安科里王朝的最后一个首都。在1181年，贾瓦里曼七世从巴普修和菲利亚卡斯等现存的建筑开始，在他们周围建造了一个宏伟的封闭城市，加上了外墙、护城河和吴哥窟的一些最伟大的寺庙，其中包括他的国家庙宇巴戎，位于城市中心。城门有五个入口，每一个都有一个基点，还有通往皇宫的胜利大门。每扇门都有四个巨大的脸。南门经常是旅游的第一站。



\6. 阿拉伯克尔白圣殿（Kaaba temple）

克尔白圣殿是一个位于沙特阿拉伯麦加的长剑状建筑，是伊斯兰教最神圣的地方，最古老，也是世界上最著名的文化纪念碑。《可兰经》指出，卡巴是由亚伯拉罕和他的儿子以实玛利在阿拉伯半岛定居后建造的。这座建筑周围建了一座清真寺，无论在哪里，全世界的穆斯林都在祈祷时面对着卡巴。

### 课文理解

《雨中的猫》（Cat in the Rain）讲述了一对美国夫妇在意大利旅行，一天在旅馆里，妻子看到窗外的大雨里有一只猫蜷缩在绿色的桌子下，感觉可怜，想把那只猫救上来。但等到她走到窗下，却发现猫已经不见了。回到房间后，妻子无比失落，不断向丈夫哀诉。最后，旅馆的老板派侍女送上来了一只玳瑁猫。这对夫妇的对话和行为表现都暗藏了有意思的小细节，比如他们俩之间其实早已缺乏热情、貌合神离——

💧**Clue 1**: There is passion lacking between the couple.



**Evidence 1**: "I'm going down and get that kitty," the American wife said.

"I'll do it," her husband offered from the bed.

"No, I'll get it. The poor kitty is out trying to keep dry under the table."

The husband went on reading, lying propped up with the two pillows at the foot of the bed.

"Don't get wet," he said.

“我要下去捉那只小猫。”美国太太说。

“我来去捉吧。”她丈夫从床上说。

“不，我去捉。外边那只小猫正躲在桌子底下避雨呢。”

丈夫继续看书，他肩后垫着两只枕头，躺在床脚那一头。

“别淋湿了。”他说。



**Evidence 2**: "It was gone."

"Wonder where it went to," he said, resting his eyes from reading. She sat down on the bed.

"I wanted it so much," she said. "I don't know why I wanted it so much. I wanted that poor kitty. It isn't any fun to be a poor kitty out in the rain."

George was reading again.

“跑掉了。”

“不知跑到哪里去了。”他说。眼睛移开书，休息一下。她在床上坐下。

“我太想要那只猫了。”她说，“我不知道我为什么那么想要那只猫。我要那只可怜的小猫。做一只待在外面雨里的可怜的小猫，可不是什么乐事啊。”

乔治又在看书了。



第一个细节是当妻子提出要下去救猫的时候，丈夫只是礼貌性地提出要下去，随后便继续看书不为所动了。第二个细节是妻子回来后哀叹自己多么想要那只猫，丈夫敷衍地回答后就充耳不闻了。这两个细节都说明了这对夫妇彼此之间的冷淡疏离——丈夫欠缺对妻子的关心，妻子也毅然不顾地单独行动。



妻子又继续喋喋不休地哭诉，她不仅想要猫，她还想把自己的头发重新留长好扎个发髻，直到最后已经语无伦次了（"Anyway, I want a cat," she said, "I want a cat. I want a cat now. If I can't have long hair or any fun, I can have a cat."）这里实际上暗示了妻子对猫的渴望、以及对自己外型的不满，其实都是她内心对自己在婚姻中的女性地位和身份的焦虑外显——



💧**Clue 2**: The wife is anxious about her status and identity in the marriage.



**Evidence 1**: "Don't you think it would be a good idea if I let my hair grow out?" she asked, looking at her profile again.

George looked up and saw the back of her neck, clipped close like a boy's.

"I like it the way it is."

"I get so tired of it," she said. "I get so tired of looking like a boy."

“我把头发留起来，你不觉得很好吗？”她问道，又端详起自己的侧影来。

乔治抬起头，看她的后边的头颈。头发剪得短短的，真像一个男孩。

“我喜欢你现在这样子。”

“我可烦透这样子了。”她说，“看上去像个男孩，我真烦透了。”



**Evidence 2**: She laid the mirror down on the dresser and went over to the window and looked out. It was getting dark.

"I want to pull my hair back tight and smooth and make a big knot at the back that I can feel," she said. "I want to have a kitty to sit on my lap and purr when I stroke her."

她把镜子放在梳妆台上，走到窗边，向外望去。天渐渐黑了。

“我要把头发向后光滑地梳起扎紧，在后脑勺扎个我可以摸到的大发髻。”她说，“我要让一只小猫坐在我腿上，我一抚摸它，它就会呜呜叫。”



20世纪初的20年代，美国社会中的女性地位正在发生巨大的变化。比如女性开始留短发，打扮穿着更加中性，这些都代表了女性对开放和独立自由的渴望。这位妻子也追随了当时的浪潮，但她表现出了相反的焦虑和不安；或者说，她在重新找回女性在家庭当中的传统角色。对猫的渴望也是对孩子的渴望——成为母亲；留长头发就更不必说了，这是长久以来对女性特质的一个刻板印象。



最后小说的结尾也很有意味，旅馆的老板派侍女送来了一只猫。而在这之前，旅馆老板对这位妻子殷勤有加，这也激发了她的好感（The wife liked him. She liked the way he wanted to serve her. ）然而故事就这样戛然而止了（"Excuse me," she said, "the padrone asked me to bring this for the Signora."）剩下的是给读者无限的想象空间。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****All Kinds of Cats**

**各个种类的猫**

我们今天的故事是围绕雨中之猫展开的。（Outside right under their window a cat was crouched under one of the dripping green tables. The cat was trying to make herself so compact that she would not be dripped on.）在今天的彩蛋中我们就来看一看都有哪些种类的猫，一起来云吸猫吧～



\1. 英国短毛猫（British Shorthair）

体形圆胖，四肢粗短发达，毛短而密，头大脸圆，温柔平静，对人友善，极易饲养。大而圆的眼睛根据被毛不同而呈现各种颜色。作为一个古老的猫品种，其历史可追溯至古罗马时期的家猫，由于拥有悠久的育种历史，可以称得上是猫家族中的典范。更重要的是，有了广泛的配种历史后，这种猫拥有了更健康的身体和更温驯的性格。



\2. 美国短毛猫（American Shorthair）

又称美洲短毛虎纹猫，美国短毛猫素以体格魁梧，骨骼粗壮，肌肉发达，生性聪明，性格温顺著称，是短毛猫中的大体型猫。是由美国人把欧洲猫与美洲大陆的土种猫加以改良而育成，是家猫中的传统品种。1971年，其被选为美国最好的猫种之一。



\3. 波斯猫（Persian cat）

以阿富汗的土种长毛猫和土耳其的安哥拉长毛猫为基础，在英国经过100多年的选种繁殖，于1860年诞生的一个品种。波斯猫是最常见的长毛猫，波斯猫有一张讨人喜爱的面庞，长而华丽的背毛，优雅的举止，故有“猫中王子”、“王妃”之称，是世界上爱猫者最喜欢的纯种猫之一，占有极其重要的地位。



\4.  斯芬克斯猫（Sphynx cat）

亦称加拿大无毛猫（Canadian Hairless），是加拿大安大略省多伦多市养猫爱好者在1966年从一窝几乎是无毛的猫仔中，经过近交选育，特意为对猫毛过敏的爱猫者培育成的。这种猫是自然的基因突变产生的宠物猫，除了在耳、口、鼻、尾前锻、脚等部位有些又薄又软的胎毛外，其它全身部分均无毛，皮肤多皱有弹性。加拿大无毛猫性情温顺，独立性强，无攻击性，能与其它猫狗相处。



\5. 布偶猫（Ragdoll）

又称布拉多尔，发源于美国，是一种杂交品种宠物猫。是现存体型最大、体重最重的猫之一。头呈楔形，眼大而圆，被毛丰厚，四肢较长且富有肉感，尾长，身体柔软，毛色有重点色、手套色或双色等等。布偶猫较为温顺好静，对人友善。其美丽优雅又非常类似于狗的性格（Puppy cat），而又被称为"仙女猫"，"小狗猫"。特殊的外貌和温和的性格是布偶猫最大的特点之一。



\6. 暹罗猫（Siamese cat）

世界著名的短毛猫，也是短毛猫的代表品种。种族原产于暹罗（今泰国），故名暹罗猫。在200多年前，这种珍贵的猫仅在泰国的皇宫和大寺院中饲养，是足不出户的贵族。暹罗猫能够较好适应主人当地的气候，且性格刚烈好动，机智灵活，好奇心特强，善解人意。



\7. 加菲猫（Garfield）

有着浑圆的眼睛，大而圆的头部，两眼间距较阔，脖子短而粗，鼻子很短，因为鼻节较短泪腺发达容易流眼泪，性格温顺，十分亲人。

A Day's Wait

He came into the room to shut the windows while we were still in bed and I saw he looked ill.

He was shivering, his face was white, and he walked slowly as though it ached to move.

"What's the matter, Schatz?" "I've got a headache."

"You better go back to bed." "No, I'm all right."

"You go to bed. I'll see you when I'm dressed.”

But when I came downstairs he was dressed, sitting by the fire, looking a very sick and miserable boy of nine years.

When I put my hand on his forehead I knew he had a fever.

"You go up to bed," I said, "you're sick." "I'm all right," he said.

When the doctor came he took the boy's temperature.

"What is it?"I asked him. "One hundred and two."

Downstairs, the doctor left three different medicines in different colored capsules with instructions for giving them.

Back in the room I wrote the boy's temperature down and made a note of the time to give the various capsules.

"Do you want me to read to you?" "All right. If you want to," said the boy.

His face was very white and there were dark areas under his eyes.

He lay still in bed and seemed very detached from what was going on.

I read aloud from Howard Pyle's Book of Pirates; but I could see he was not following what I was reading.

"How do you feel, Schatz?"I asked him.

"Just the same, so far." he said.

I sat at the foot of the bed and read to myself while I waited for it to be time to give another capsule.

It would have been natural for him to go to sleep, but when I looked up he was looking at the foot of the bed, looking very strangely.

"Why don't you try to go to sleep? I'll wake you up for the medicine."

"I'd rather stay awake."After a while he said to me, "You don't have to stay here with me, Papa, if it bothers you."

"It doesn't bother me." "No, I mean you don't have to stay if it's going to bother you."

I thought perhaps he was a little light-headed and after giving him the prescribed capsule at eleven o'clock I went out for a while.

"Take this with water." "Do you think it will do any good?"

"Of course it will."I sat down and opened the Pirate book and commenced to read, but I could see he was not following, so I stopped.

"What?" "About how long will it be before I die?"

"You aren't going to die. What's the matter with you?"

"Oh, yes, I am. I heard him say a hundred and two."

"People don't die with a fever of onehundred and two. That's a silly way to talk."

### 背景知识

**💧****Celsius and Fahrenheit Scales**

**摄氏度和华氏度**

我们今天的内容中出现了两种不同的体温计，一种是以摄氏度量化，一种以华氏度。（It's like miles and kilometers. You aren't going to die. That's a different thermometer. On that thermometer thirty-seven is normal. On this kind it's ninety-eight. 这好比英里和公里。你不会死的。那是两种体温表啊。那种表上三十七度算正常。这种表要九十八度才算正常。）那么摄氏度和华氏度有哪些差别呢？



\1. 所代表的含义不同：

摄氏度：是指在1标准大气压下，纯净的冰水混合物的温度为0度，水的沸点为100度，其间平均分为100份，每一等份为1度，记作1℃。

华氏度：是指在标准大气压下，冰的熔点为32℉，水的沸点为212℉，中间有180等分，每等分为华氏1度，记作“1℉”。



\2. 适用范围不同：

摄氏度：包括我国在内的世界上绝大多数国家都使用摄氏度。

华氏度：世界上仅有5个国家使用华氏度，包括巴哈马、伯利兹、英属开曼群岛、帕劳、美利坚合众国及其他附属领土（波多黎各、关岛、美属维京群岛）。

\3. 代表符号不同：

摄氏度：用符号℃。是以其发明者安德斯·摄尔修斯（Anders Celsius，1701-1744）的姓氏的第一个字母“C”来表示。

华氏度：符号℉。是以其发明者德国人华伦海特（Gabriel D. Fahrenheit，1686—1736）命名的。



💧**Howard Pyle and Book of Pirates**

**霍华德•派尔和他的《海贼王》**

文章中提到爸爸给儿子读霍华德•派尔的《海贼王》。（I read aloud from Howard Pyle's*Book of Pirates*; but I could see he was not following what I was reading.）我们一起来了解一下吧～



\1. 霍华德•派尔（Howard Pyle）

美国著名插画家、作家，是难得一见的在文字写作和绘画方面皆造诣不凡的大师级人物。霍华德·派尔少年时代就表现出超人的绘画才能，为—些杂志定期绘制插图，此外他在写作方面也很有天赋，因之前接到许多民闾故事和传说，也就促成后来他创作了一系列骑士和英雄人物的历险记，主要作品有《海贼王》《罗宾汉奇遇记》《银手奥托》《骑士麦尔斯》等，大多取材于中世纪的神话或殖民地时期历史，再现了那个时代的社会风貌。霍华德·派尔的作品在英文领域—直有着良好的口碑，被列为世界名著，《海贼王》《骑士麦尔斯》等被列入欧美青少年必读书目。



\2. *Book of Pirates*

《海贼王》

这本书以独特的视角描述了一些历史上著名的海盗故事，从布兰德船长的幽灵到杰克巴里斯特的财宝，一幕幕或是妙趣横生或是惊心动魄，使人尤如身临其境。一大批极富盛名的海盗头子，包括著名的黑胡子爱德华·提奇、基德船长、黑色准男爵罗伯茨等都是这段时间海盗史上的传奇人物，使读者可以更真实地了解海盗的生存世界，真正走进那段血雨腥风的旷世传奇。 

### 课文理解

《一天的等待》（*A Day's Wait*）里的主人公是一个小男孩，他感染了流感，发着高烧（102华氏度，大约接近39摄氏度）。虽然这个故事在表面上似乎只是简单的小男孩因为不知道摄氏度和华氏度的差别，而误以为自己很快就要死了，但其实里面有很多暗藏的细节。首先是父亲和小男孩之间的言语交流鲜少，并且父亲也疏于察看儿子的心里状态。所以当他知道原来儿子误会了温度计算标准而陷入沮丧的时候很是惊讶——

💧**Clue 1**: The father doesn't tend much to the boy's inner feelings.



**Evidence 1**: After a while he said to me, 'You don't have to stay here with me, Papa, if it bothers you.'

'It doesn't bother me.'

'No, I mean you don't have to stay if it's going to bother you.'

I thought perhaps he was a little light-headed and after giving him the prescribed capsule at eleven o'clock I went out for a while.

过了一会儿，他对我说：“要是你心烦就不用在这儿陪我，爸爸。”

“我没心烦。”

“不，我是说如果叫你心烦的话，就不用在这儿陪。”

我以为他也许有点头晕，到了十一点我给他吃了医生开的药丸后就到外面去了一会儿。



**Evidence 2**: 'About what time do you think I'm going to die?' he asked.

'What?'

'About how long will it be before I die?'

'You aren't going to die. What's the matter with you?'

'Oh, yes, I am. I heard him say a hundred and two.'

'People don't die with a fever of one hundred and two. That's a silly way to talk.'

“你看我几时会死？”他问。

“什么？”

“我还能活多久才死？”

“你不会死的。你怎么啦？”

“哦，是的，我要死了。我听见他说一百零二度的。”

“发烧到一百零二度可死不了。你这么说可真傻。”



内心冲突是这篇小说的一大特点，人物之间没有外在的争斗或冲突，矛盾都隐藏在内心活动里。比如这里就是小男孩在不小心听到医生告诉父亲自己的体温后什么话也没说，而是暗自陷在悲观沮丧里。这样再回头看一开始小男孩对父亲说的话（让他如果觉得心烦就不用在床边陪着他），我们就能明白事出何因了。



这也解释了他之后表现出来的敏感，甚至可以说过度反应：他不让任何人走进他的房间，因为他觉得自己感染了流感就要死了，这是一个致命可怕的病，所以他不让家人进去看他。（At the house they said the boy had refused to let anyone come into the room. 'You can't come in,' he said. 'You mustn't get what I have.'）



虽然后来父亲给他解释清楚了其间的误会，但小男孩的心态是否真的重新恢复如初了呢？作者留下来了一个模棱两可的结尾——



💧**Clue 2**: The impact on the boy is ambiguous.



**Evidence 1**: 'Are you sure?'

'Absolutely,' I said. 'It's like miles and kilometers. You know, like how many kilometers we make when we do seventy in the car?'

'Oh,' he said.

“这话当真？”

“绝对错不了，”我说，“好比英里和公里。你知道我们开车时车速七十英里合多少公里吗？”

“哦。”他说。



**Evidence 2**: The hold over himself relaxed too, finally, and the next day it was very slack and he cried very easily at little things that were of no importance.

他内心的紧张终于松弛下来了。第二天一点也不紧张而来，为了一点小事，动不动就哭了。



最后一句提到：he cried very easily at little things that were of no importance，这里会让读者非常矛盾？前面不是说他不再那么紧张了吗？那么这里的“他动不动就为一点小事哭”是尽管他恢复好了，但他本来的性格就如此，还是指因为这一次的经历让他变得敏感多疑，所以总是很容易被惹哭？



结合作者自己在战场上的经历，以及目睹战事中的伤痛病死，这里可以猜测作者想表达的主旨是即便是很小的伤害或恐惧，都可以对一个人的性格造成影响，或者因此而永远烙上心理伤疤。

**💧****How to Describe Diseases**

**生病的英文表达方法**



我们今天的内容当中描述了Schatz患流感的情景。（He seemed to know all about influenza and said there was nothing to worry about if the fever did not go above one hundred and four degrees. This was a light epidemic of flu and there was no danger if you avoided pneumonia.）接下来我们一起来看一下生病该如何用英语表达吧～



\1. have：表示“生病”，后常跟表示疾病的名词，是最通俗的说法，多用于口语。

例句：As I remember, my brother and sister both had severe asthmatic attacks in the childhood.

我记得，我弟弟和妹妹小时候都得过严重的哮喘病。



\2. take/catch:均可表示“生病”，且含有“感染”之意。美国人多用take，英国人多用catch。

例句：Mary takes cold easily. 玛丽易患感冒。

Towards the end of the year, his son caught scarlet fever. 快到年底的时候他儿子得了腥红热。



\3. suffer from: 常用来表示“患病”，后接疾病名词，多用于医生与病人的交谈之中。

例句：Is there anybody in your family who has suffered from the same eye disease as you? 你家中还有没有人得过跟你一样的眼病?



\4. (be) ill with: 如表示“患......病”的时候后面须跟with，多见于英式英语。

例句：The patient is ill with influenza. 病人患流行性感冒。



\5. be vulnerable to: 一般常用来表示“易患......病”。

例句：Fibres from the macular region of the retina are particularly vulnerable to inflammation. 视网膜斑区的纤维特别易患炎症。



\6. expose...to (be exposed to): 以为“使......易患......病”，“易患......病”。

例句： An attack of fever weakens a child and exposes it to all kinds of infections. 发烧使患儿虚弱，易患各种感染。

When having cold, children are exposed to pneumonia. 孩子感冒时易患肺炎。



\7. be seized with: 一般表示“突然患......病”。

例句：The patient was seized with apoplexy yesterday afernoon.病人昨天下午忽患中风。



\8. be attacked with: 基本意是“为......疾病所侵袭”，常译成“患......病”。

例句：Attacked with acute myocardial inraction, the patient was surveilled for a week in hospital. 病人患急性心肌梗塞后，在医院里监护了一个星期。



\9. be afflicted with: 其基本意为“为......病所折磨”，常用来表达“患......病”，其特征是，不仅表示患病的开始，还表示患病过程中所受之苦，特别是精神上的痛苦。

例句：For many years Harold was afflicted with edematous laryngitis. 哈德罗患水肿性喉炎多年了。



\10. be infected with: 意为“被......所感染”，“被......所侵袭”，可译成“患......病”。

例句：On necropsy the patient was found to have been infected with tuberculosis as well. 尸检发现病人还患过结核病。

Big Two-Hearted River

The train went on up the track out of sight, around one of the hills of burnt timber.

Nick sat down on the bundle of canvas and bedding the baggage man had pitched out of the door of the baggage car.

There was no town, nothing but the rails and the burned-over coun-try.

The thirteen saloons that had lined the one street of Seney had not left a trace.

The foundations of the Mansion House hotel stuck up above the ground.

The stone was chipped and split by the fire.

It was all that was left of the town of Seney.

Even the surface had been burned off the ground.

Nick looked at the burned-over stretch of hillside, where he had expected to find the scattered houses of the town and then walked down the railroad track to the bridge over the river.

The river was there. It swirled against the log spiles of the bridge.

Nick looked down into the clear, brown water, colored from the pebbly bottom, and watched the trout keeping themselves steady in the current with wavering fins.

As he watched them they changed their positions by quick angles, only to hold steady in the fast water again.

Nick watched them a long time.

He watched them holding themselves with their noses into the current, many trout in deep, fast moving water, slightly distorted as he watched far down through the glassy convex surface of the pool,

its surface pushing and swelling smooth against the resistance of thelog-driven piles of the bridge.

Nick looked down into the pool from the bridge. It was a hot day.

A kingfisher flew up the stream.

It was a long time since Nick had looked into a stream and seen trout.

They were very satisfactory.

As the shadow of the kingfisher moved up the stream, a big trout shot upstream in a long angle, only his shadow marking the angle,

then lost his shadow as he came through the surface of the water, caught the sun, and then, as he went back into the stream under thesurface,

his shadow seemed to float down the stream with the current, unresisting, to his post under the bridge where he tightened facing upinto the current.

Nick’s heart tightened as the trout moved. He felt all the old feeling.

He turned and looked down the stream.

It stretched away, pebbly-bottomed with shallows and big boulders and a deep pool as it curved away around the foot of a bluff.

Nick walked back up the ties to where his pack lay in the cinders beside the railway track. He was happy.

He adjusted the pack harness around the bundle, pulling straps tight, slung the pack on his back, got his arms through the shoulder straps and took some of the pull off his shoulders by leaning his forehead against the wide band of the tump-line.

Still, it was too heavy. It was much too heavy.

He had his leather rod-case in his hand and leaning forward to keep the weight of the pack high on his shoulders he walked along the road that paralleled the railway track, leaving the burned town behind in the heat,

and then turned off around a hill with a high, fire-scarred hill on either side onto a road that went back into the country.

He walked along the road feeling the ache from the pull of the heavy pack.

The road climbed steadily. It was hard work walking up-hill.

His muscles ached and the day was hot, but Nick felt happy.

He felt he had left everything behind, the need for thinking, the need to write, other needs. It was all back of him.

From the time he had gotten down off the train and the baggage man had thrown his pack out of the open car door things had been different.

Seney was burned, the country was burned over and changed, but it did not matter.

It could not all be burned. He knew that.

He hiked along the road, sweating in the sun, climbing to cross the range of hills that separated the railway from the pine plains.

The road ran on, dipping occasionally, but always climbing.

>
> 快到帕克山山顶的时候，山路突降，继而又突升。

Nick went on up. Finally the road after going parallel to the burnt hillside reached the top.

Nick leaned back against a stump and slipped out of the pack harness.

Ahead of him, as far as he could see, was the pine plain.

The burned country stopped off at the left with the range of hills.

On ahead islands of dark pine treesrose out of the plain.

Far off to the left was the line of the river.

Nick followed it with his eye and caught glints of the water in the sun.

There was nothing but the pine plain ahead of him, until the far blue hills that marked the Lake Superior height of land.

He could hardly see them, faint and far away in the heat-light over the plain. If he looked too steadily they were gone.

But if he only half-looked they were there, the far-off hills of the height of land.

>
> 猎户座的迭代是为了打算远行到火星或遥远的小行星。

Nick sat down against the charred stump and smoked a cigarette.

His pack balanced on the top of the stump, harness holding ready, a hollow molded in it from his back.

Nick sat smoking, looking out over the country. He did not need to get his map out.

He knew where he was from the position of the river.

As he smoked, his legs stretched out in front of him, he noticed a grasshopper walk along the ground and up onto his woolen sock.

The grasshopper was black. As he had walked along the road, climbing, he had started many grasshoppers from the dust.

They were all black. They were not the big grasshoppers with yellow and black or red and black wings whirring out from their black wing sheathing as they fly up.

> ==sheath英 [ʃi:θ] 美 [ʃiθ] n. 套；鞘；护套；紧身连衣裙==

These were just ordinary hoppers, but all a sooty black in color.

Nick had wondered about them as he walked, without really thinking about them.

Now, as he watched the black hopper that was nibbling at the woolof his sock with its fourway lip, he realized that they had all turned black from living in the burned-over land.

He realized that the fire must have come the year before, but the grasshoppers were all black now.

He wondered how long they would stay that way.

Carefully he reached his hand downand took hold of the hopper by the wings.

He turned him up, all his legs walking in the air, and looked at his jointed belly.

Yes, it was black too, iridescent where the back and head were dusty.

“Go on, hopper,” Nick said, speaking out loud for the first time. “Fly away somewhere.”

He tossed the grasshopper up into the air and watched him sail away to a charcoal stump across the road.

Nick stood up. He leaned his back against the weight of his pack where it rested upright on the stumpand got his arms through the shoulder straps.

He stood with the pack on his back on the brow of the hill looking out across the country toward the distant river and then struck down the hillside away from the road.

Underfoot the ground was good walking.

Two hundred yards down the hillside the fire line stopped.

Then it was sweet fern, growing ankle high, to walk through, and clumps of jack pines; a long undulating country with frequent rises and descents, sandy underfoot and the country alive again.

> ==undulating英 ['ʌndjəˌletɪŋ] 美 ['ʌndjəˌletɪŋ] adj. 起伏的==
>
> ==descent英 [dɪˈsent] 美 [dɪˈsɛnt] n. 下降；坡道；堕落；出身，血统==

Nick kept his direction by the sun.

He knew where he wanted to strike the river and he kept on through thepine plain, mounting small rises to see other rises ahead of him

and sometimes from the top of a rise a great solid island of pines off to his right or his left.

He broke off some sprigs of the heathery sweet fern, and put them under his pack straps.

The chafing crushed it and he smelled it as he walked.

He was tired and very hot, walking across the uneven, shadeless pine plain.

At any time he knew he could strikethe river by turning off to his left.

It could not be more than a mile away.

But he kept on toward the north to hit the river as far upstream as he could go in one day’s walking.

For some time as he walked Nick had been in sight of one of the big islands of pine standing out above the rolling high ground he was crossing.

He dipped down and then as he came slowly up to the crest of the bridge he turned and made toward the pine trees.

There was no underbrush in the island of pine trees.

The trunks of the trees went straightup or slanted toward each other.

The trunks were straight and brown without branches.

The branches were high above. Some interlocked to make a solid shadow on the brown forest floor.

Around the grove of trees was a bare space. It was brown and soft underfoot as Nick walked on it.

This was the over-lapping of the pine needle floor, extending out beyond the width of the high branches.

The trees had grown tall and the branches moved high, leaving in thesun this bare space they had once covered with shadow.

Sharp at the edge of this extension of the forest floor commenced the sweet fern.

Nick slipped off his pack and lay down in the shade.

He lay on his back and looked up into the pine trees.

His neck and back and the small of his back rested as he stretched.

The earth felt good against his back. He looked up at the sky, through the branches, and then shuthis eyes.

He opened them and looked up again. There was a wind high up in the branches.

He shut his eyes again and went to sleep.

### 背景知识

**💧****The Wilderness Therapy**

**荒野疗法**

我们今天的内容中Nick在参加大战后，身心受到损伤，回到密执安州北部少年时代常去的钓鱼之地。后来在海明威的回忆录（memoir）《不固定的圣节》（*A Moveable Feast*）中“饥饿是有益的磨练”一节中写道：“该故事写的是战后还乡的事，但全篇中没有一字提到战争。”



Nick回到家乡想要缓解自己的战争创伤，然而家乡已是一片荒野（There was no town, nothing but the rails and the burned-over coun-try. The thirteen saloons that had lined the one street of Seney had not left a trace...It was all that was left of the town of Seney. Even the surface had been burned off the ground.）。在心理学当中，有一种治疗法就是荒野疗法，我们今天一起来了解一下吧～



美国人所说的荒野是指“没有为人类驯服,人类只是访客并不会常驻的地区”，它可能是森林，也可能是草原、湿地或是荒漠。荒野是美国文化的重要组成部分，在美国人心中，荒野意味着自由，也暗含着冒险。



荒野疗法是一种通过在远足途中传授生活经验和社交技巧来帮助内心有困扰的年轻人的方法，主要针对情感和行为问题，最短需要1周，最长不超过3个月，每次参与者不少于10人。



荒野环境通常比较恶劣，这使得每位参与者会选择优选处理好自己问题，同时意识到团队合作的重要性。与拓展训练类似，荒野疗愈目标之一是树立参与者的信心，拓展身体和心理极限，帮助参与者掌握生存技巧和建立防御机制。



此外，荒野区别于熟悉的城市环境，所以能轻易帮助参与者从不愉快的过往中解放出来。最单纯原始的荒野环境，也会是人类内心最依赖的环境，荒野疗法师会运用冒险和恐惧的力量，唤醒参与者与自然之间最原始的链接。



还有，简单地徒步穿越荒野，这使得大脑思维也变得简单，再加上荒野疗法师擅长运用自然隐喻，有效促进参与者内省，所以荒野疗愈会是一种行之有效的心理干预方法。



作为神经科临床治疗方法，医院患者是荒野治疗的主要受众，适应症包括药物滥用、青少年暴力和抑郁问题等等。不只是精神疾病，针对摄食障碍、身体残障和癌症等身体疾病，荒野疗愈也有很多成功案例。



作为教育方法，美国学校通过荒野疗愈来传授自然知识，提高学生风险控制能力和领导能力。对于网络成瘾和青少年犯罪等问题，荒野治疗通常是传统监禁的有效补充。除了治疗和教育之外，更多荒野治疗形态是与团队拓展训练结合在一起，帮助个人成长。



史蒂夫·卡迪萨诺（Steve Cartisano）因颇具争议的荒野治疗项目而出名，他创立了“挑战者基金会”（Challenger Foundation）和美国、南美地区其他一些项目。有一次卡迪萨诺被指控因疏忽而杀人，因为在他监管下的两个少年死于远程旅行。虽然荒野疗法可以达到预期效果，但是运用不道德的方法，有时甚至是残忍的方法来帮助苦苦挣扎的年轻人，这遭到了强烈指责。

### 课文理解

《大双心河》（*Big Two-Hearted River*）的背景是Nick从一战的欧洲战场返回，他故地重游，想要以此治疗战争留给自己的创伤。今天的内容里，就有多处环境描写暗示了战争带来的摧毁性结果——

💧**Clue 1**: The implication of war influences.



**Evidence 1**: The train went on up the track out of sight, around one of the hills of burnt timber...There was no town, nothing but the rails and the burned-over coun-try... The thirteen saloons that had lined the one street of Seney had not left a trace.

火车沿着轨道向前行驶，绕过一座满是烧焦树木的小山，就不见了踪影…没有村镇，什么也没有，只有铁轨和被火烧过的土地。赛妠镇唯一的一条街道边上曾经有过十三家酒馆，现在都已经荡然无存。



**Evidence 2**: The stone was chipped and split by the fire. It was all that was left of the town of Seney. Even the surface had been burned off the ground.

基石被火烧碎，开裂了。塞纳镇就剩下这些了。连土地的表层也被烧毁了。



小说一开篇，作者就描绘了村镇在战争侵袭后一片凋零的模样。不仅如此，还有对自然环境所遭受的破坏的描写，比如土地的表层也被“烧毁”了。burnt, burned-over以及had been burned off的重复出现和强调，也增添了整个环境氛围的压抑和沉重感。



Nick之所以回到这个地方，我们可以从下文的描述里看出，他其实是想重新疗愈自己所受的创伤。比如有一个细节提到他其实还是会不时地被某些景象触动而联系到自己的遭遇——



💧**Clue 2**: Nick is trying to restore his inner peace.



**Evidence 1**: ...as he went back into the stream under the surface, his shadow seemed to float down the stream with the current, unresisting, to his post under the bridge where he tightened facing up into the current.

Nick’s heart tightened as the trout moved. He felt all the old feeling.

它穿过水面回到水里，它的身影仿佛随着水流一路飘去，毫无阻碍地直漂到它在桥底下常待的地方，在那里绷紧着身子，脸冲着流水。

看着鳟鱼的动作，尼克的心抽紧了。旧时的感受全部涌上心头。



**Evidence 2**: It was hard work walking up-hill. His muscles ached and the day was hot, but Nick felt happy. He felt he had left everything behind, the need for thinking, the need to write, other needs. It was all back of him.

登山真是一件难事。尼克肌肉发痛，天气又热，但他感到很开心。他感到已把一切都抛在脑后了，不需要思索，不需要写作，不需要做其他事情。一切都被抛在脑后了。



为什么说看到鳟鱼Nick就联想到了自己的遭遇呢？上文里描写了鳟鱼在激流中努力稳住身子来抵抗流水的冲刷（big trout looking to hold themselves on the gravel bottom in a varying mist of gravel and sand, raised in spurts by the current），这里象征着像Nick这样的退伍士兵其实也无时不刻不在抵抗战争带来的“痛苦”的激流，避免让自己的精神世界扭曲变形。这种挣扎和努力他十分有同感。



接着他开始登山。这是一个体力活，他虽然感觉吃力，但心情十分愉悦。这里“向上”的动作也在暗示着他在努力挣脱现在所处的情感黑洞，而向积极的方向努力。走累了之后他卸下背包在树荫底下休息（Nick slipped off his pack and lay down in the shade.）最后他就这么睡着了（He shut his eyes again and went to sleep.）

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****How to Determine the Direction When We Get Lost in the Wild**

**在野外迷路时如何确定方向？**



我们今天的内容中有这样的场景，在荒野里Nick凭借太阳确定自己的方向（Nick kept his direction by the sun.）。现在野外生存越来越受都市人群的欢迎，喧嚣的闹市根本感受不到大自然的安宁，而旅游观光又弥补不了人们内心的空虚，所以就用工作之余难得的假期走入大自然去挑战自我，但是有挑战就有困难和危险，走入荒野一片茫然，没有人烟、没有道路，极易迷失方向陷入进退两难的困境，所以这个时候会用科学的方法辨别方向至关重要，下面就来讲讲在野外如何辨别方向吧～



\1. 利用指南针（ compass）判断方向

这是最方便的方法。磁针的北极指向地理的北极。



\2. 利用太阳判断方向

我国大部分地区在北回归线以北，正午太阳位于天顶偏向南方，对着太阳，前面是南，背面是北，左面是东，右面是西。太阳东升西落，早晨起来，面向太阳，前面是东，后面是西，左面是北，右面是南；傍晚对着太阳，前面是西，背后是东，左面是南，右面是北。如果是南半球太阳会是在朝北的方向东升西落。



\3. 利用手表判断方向

必须是指针式的手表。把当前的时间除以2,把所得的商数对准太阳.表盘上12所对的方向就是北方。如果是上午10点，把手表刻度盘上的“5”对准太阳，下午2点（14点）则把手表刻度盘上的“7”对准太阳，这时，手表刻度盘上的“12”指的就是北方。  



\4. 利用北极星（ Polaris ）判断方向

如果是晴朗的夜空可以观看北极星，北极星永远在地球的正北方。如果不知道哪颗星是北极星，可以先找到酷似勺子形状的北斗七星，在勺子最外沿的那颗星延伸五个星位对应的那颗亮星就是北极星。



\5. 利用木棍判断方向

在太阳的底下立一根木棍，把影子的末端摆一个记号，十五分钟后影子会移动，在移动后的末端再摆一个记号，连接两个记号形成一条线，这条线就是东西方向。



\5. 利用树木判断方向

通常情况下，北半球树木南面受到阳光照射的时间较长，枝叶长得茂密些；北面受到阳光照射较少，枝叶稀少些。树木的南面阳光照射比较充足，木质生长较快，形成的年轮宽些。因而，年轮较稀的一边是南方，年轮较紧密的一边是北方。 



\6. 利用积雪判断方向

丘陵上的积雪，南坡比北坡融化得快些。沟里的积雪，朝南的一面比朝北的一面融化得快些。　



\7. 利用青苔判断方向

青苔喜欢阴暗潮湿的环境。石头上的青苔往往生长在北面。

He leaned over with the pack on and picked up the leather rod-case and started out from the pine trees across the sweet fern swale, toward the river.

He knew it could not be more than a mile.

He came down a hillside covered with stumps into a meadow.

At the edge of the meadow flowed the river.

Nick was glad to get to the river. He walked upstream through the meadow.

His trousers were soaked with the dew as he walked.

> <font color=red>His trousers were soaked with the dew as he walked.</font>

> 他走着走着，裤腿被露水弄得湿透了。

>
> 我们的衣服给汗水湿透了。

After the hot day, the dew had come quickly and heavily.

The river made no sound. It was too fast and smooth.

At the edge of the meadow, before he mounted to a piece of high ground to make camp, Nick looked down the river at the trout rising.

They were rising to insects come from the swamp on the other side of the stream when the sun went down.

The trout jumped out of water to take them.

While Nick walked through the little stretch of meadow alongside the stream, trout had jumped high out of water.

> <font color=red>While Nick walked through the little stretch of meadow alongside the stream, trout had jumped high out of water.</font>

Now as he looked down the river, the insects must be settling on the surface, for the trout were feeding steadily all down the stream.

As far down the long stretch as he could see, the trout were rising, making circles all down the surface of the water, as though it were starting to rain.

The ground rose, wooded and sandy, to overlook the meadow, the stretch of river and the swamp.

Nick dropped his pack and rod-caseand looked for a level piece of ground.

He was very hungry and he wanted to make his camp before he cooked.

Between two jack pines, the ground was quite level.

That leveled a piece of ground large enough to sleep on.

His hands smelled good from the sweet fern. He smoothed the uprooted earth.

He did not want anything making lumps under the blankets.

When he had the ground smooth, he spread his three blankets.

One he folded double, next to the ground. The other two he spread ontop.

With the ax he slit off a bright slab of pine from one of the stumps and split it into pegs for the tent.

He wanted them long and solid to hold in the ground.

With the tent unpacked and spread on the ground, the pack, leaning against a jackpine, looked much smaller.

Nick tied the rope that served the tent for a ridge-pole to the trunk of one of the pine trees and pulled thetent up off the ground with the other end of the rope and tied it to the other pine.

The tent hung on the rope like a canvas blanket on a clothesline.

Nick poked a pole he had cut up under the back peak of the canvas and then made it a tent by pegging out the sides.

He pegged the sides out taut and drove the pegs deep, hitting them down into the ground with the flat ofthe ax until the rope loops were buried and the canvas was drum tight.

Across the open mouth of the tent Nick fixed cheesecloth to keep out mosquitoes.

He crawled inside under the mosquito bar with various things from the pack to put at the head of the bed under the slant of the canvas.

Inside the tent the light came through the brown canvas.

It smelled pleasantly of canvas. Already there was something mysterious and homelike.

Nick was happy as he crawled inside the tent. He had not been unhappy all day.

This was different though. Now things were done.

There had been this to do. Now it was done. It had been a hard trip.

He was very tired. That was done. He had made his camp.

He was settled. Nothing could touchhim. It was a good place to camp.

He was there, in the good place. Hewas in his home where he had made it. Now he was hungry.

He came out, crawling under the cheesecloth. It was quite dark outside. It was lighter in the tent.

Nick went over to the pack and found, with his fingers, a long nail ina paper sack of nails, in the bottom of the pack.

He drove it into the pine tree, holding it close and hitting it gently with the flat of the ax.

He hung the pack up on the nail. Allhis supplies were in the pack.

They were off the ground and sheltered now.

Nick was hungry. He did not believe he had ever been hungrier.

He opened and emptied a can of pork and beans and a can of spaghetti into the frying pan.

> ==spaghetti英 [spəˈgeti] 美 [spəˈɡɛti] n. 意大利粉，意大利面条==

"I've got a right to eat this kind of stuff, if I'm willing to carry it," Nick said.

His voice sounded strange in the darkening woods. He did not speak again.

He started a fire with some chunks of pine he got with the ax from a stump.

Over the fire he stuck a wire grill, pushing the four legs down into the ground with his boot.

Nick put the frying pan on the grill over the flames.

He was hungrier. The beans and spaghetti warmed.

Nick stirred them and mixed them together.

They began to bubble, making little bubbles that rose with difficulty to the surface.

There was a good smell. Nick got out a bottle of tomato catchup and cut four slices of bread.

> ==catchup英 ['kætʃəp] 美 ['kætʃəp] n. 调味酱（如蕃茄酱之类）==

The little bubbles were coming faster now.

Nick sat down beside the fire and lifted the frying pan off.

He poured about half the contents out into the tin plate.

It spread slowly on the plate. Nick knew it was too hot.

He poured on some tomato catchup. He knew the beans and spaghetti were still too hot.

He looked at the fire, then at the tent, he was not going to spoil it all by burning his tongue.

For years he had never enjoyed fried bananas because he had never been able to wait for them to cool.

His tongue was very sensitive. He was very hungry.

Across the river in the swamp, in the almost dark, he saw a mist rising. He looked at the tent once more.

All right. He took a full spoonful from the plate.

"Chrise," Nick said, "Geezus Chrise," he said happily.

He ate the whole plateful before he remembered the bread.

Nick finished the second plateful with the bread, mopping the plate shiny.

He had not eaten since a cup of coffee and a ham sandwich in the station restaurant at St. Ignace.

It had been a very fine experience. He had been that hungry before, but had not been able to satisfy it.

He could have made camp hours before if he had wanted to.

There were plenty of good places tocamp on the river. But this was good.

Nick tucked two big chips of pine under the grill.

The fire flared up. He had forgotten to get water for the coffee.

Out of the pack he got a folding canvas bucket and walked down thehill, across the edge of the meadow,to the stream.

The other bank was in the white mist.

The grass was wet and cold as he knelt on the bank and dipped the canvas bucket into the stream.

It bellied and pulled hard in the current. The water was ice cold.

Nick rinsed the bucket and carried itfull up to the camp.

Up away from the stream it was not so cold.

Nick drove another big nail and hung up the bucket full of water.

He dipped the coffee pot half full, put some more chips under the grill onto the fire and put the pot on.

He could not remember which way he made coffee.

He could remember an argument about it with Hopkins, but not which side he had taken.

He decided to bring it to a boil. He remembered now that was Hopkins’s way.

He had once argued about everything with Hopkins.

While he waited for the coffee to boil, he opened a small can of apricots. He liked to open cans.

He emptied the can of apricots out into a tin cup.

> ==apricot英 [ˈeɪprɪkɒt] 美 [ˈæprɪkɑ:t] n.&adj. 杏子；杏色(的)==

While he watched the coffee on the fire, he drank the juice syrup of the apricots, carefully at first to keep from spilling, then meditatively, sucking the apricots down.

> ==meditatively英 ['medɪtətɪvlɪ] 美 ['medəˌteɪtɪvlɪ] adv. 冥想地==

They were better than fresh apricots. The coffee boiled as he watched.

The lid came up and coffee and grounds ran down the side of the pot.

Nick took it off the grill. It was a triumph for Hopkins.

He put sugar in the empty apricot cup and poured some of the coffee out to cool.

It was too hot to pour and he used his hat to hold the handle of the coffee pot.

He would not let it steep in the pot at all. Not the first cup.

It should be straight Hopkins all the way. Hop deserved that.

He was a very serious coffee drinker. He was the most serious man Nick had ever known.

Not heavy, serious. That was a longtime ago. Hopkins spoke without moving his lips.

He had played polo. He made millions of dollars in Texas.

He had borrowed carfare to go to Chicago, when the wire came that his first big well had come in.

He could have wired for money. That would have been too slow.

They called Hop’s girl the Blonde Venus. Hop did not mind because she was not his real girl.

Hopkins said very confidently that none of them would make fun of hisreal girl.

He was right. Hopkins went away when the telegram came.

### 背景知识

**💧****Playing Polo**

**打马球**

我们今天的内容中Nick回想起Hopkins打马球的事情。（ He had played polo. ）我们今天一起来了解一下马球这项运动吧～

马球运动（Polo）指的是骑在马上，用马球杆击球入门的一种体育活动。马球在中国古代叫“击鞠”，发明始于汉代，兴盛于唐宋，在后来的几个世纪内流传到西方。它的名字则来自于印度，在印度当地，人们玩耍一种藏语中名叫pulu的木球。



后来，作为印度占领者的英国人将这个运动带回了大不列颠。很快，马球在英国军队中流行开来。Cachar地区首府Silchar成为现代马球的发源地。成立于1859年的Sichar俱乐部也成为世界上最古老的马球俱乐部。



1876年，詹姆斯·戈登·本纳特将马球传入美国。1878年举办了首届马球（军）团内锦标赛，这项运动迅速蔓延到世界其它国家和地区，特别是英联邦各国以及阿根廷。20世纪二三十年代是美国马球的“黄金时代”，出现了汤米·希区柯克、塞西尔·史密斯等著名选手。美国的马球运动主要在俱乐部进行。



马球曾在1908、1920、1924、1936年作为奥运会正式比赛项目 。英 、美、阿根廷、印度、中东等国今仍喜爱这项运动。



马球比赛两队对抗，每队4人，1号和2号为前锋，3号、4 号为后卫。运动员头戴马球帽，腿着皮制护膝，脚蹬棕色皮靴，身穿白色马裤和本队颜色的上衣。比赛以中线争球开始，运动员用球槌击球，每个人在场上不受位置限制。比赛过半或每攻进一球 （点球除外 ）双方交换场地。球进入两球门柱之间即得一分。



一场比赛为8小节，每节7分钟。节间休息 3分钟，半场间休息5分钟。马球场地长275米，宽 183米。马的身材和年龄不限 ，但需具备良好的速度、耐力和灵活性，特别是脾气温顺，否则易在激烈对抗中受惊、失控而引发事故。



马球运动有着一个古老而有趣的特别程序——作为一名观众，你有一项义务：踏草皮！当比赛第三巡结束的中场哨声吹响之后，坐在球场四周的球迷们便纷纷走上球场寻找那些翻起的草皮，尽情用力地踏实草皮，以使整个球场恢复平整。此刻，球场上一扫比赛紧张、激烈的气氛，取而代之的是球场上人们踏草皮的欢声笑语。



Polo衫原本称做网球衫（tennis shirt），原本是贵族打马球的时候所穿的服装，可能是因为舒适，他们喜欢穿着有领子的短袖衣服。久而久之就被人们称作是polo衫（polo shirt），后来广为大众喜爱，所以演变成一般的休闲服装。

### 课文理解

Nick醒来后，背起背包和钓竿袋开始向河边出发（He leaned over with the pack on and picked up the leather rod-case and started out from the pine trees across the sweet fern swale, toward the river.）他找了一片平地先搭起帐篷再做吃的东西。这一段是非常简单日常的描写，但从字里行间我们可以感受到Nick对这种安逸和简单的满足喜悦——

💧**Clue 1**: Nick is happy with the simple life there.



**Evidence 1**: Inside the tent the light came through the brown canvas. It smelled pleasantly of canvas. Already there was something mysterious and homelike. Nick was happy as he crawled inside the tent.

日光透过棕色帆布渗进帐篷。帆布气味很好闻，有一种神秘的气氛和家的样子。尼克爬进帐篷时，心里很开心。



**Evidence 2**: It was a good place to camp. He was there, in the good place. He was in his home where he had made it.

这是个扎营的好地方。他就在这儿，在这个好地方。他正在自己亲手建起的家里。



**Evidence 3**: He could have made camp hours before if he had wanted to. There were plenty of good places to camp on the river. But this was good.

他原本在几小时以前就可以扎营的，但是他不想那样做。这河边有的是宿营的好地点。这样就很好。



在这种简单的惬意中，作者用来描述Nick感受的词语也非常的简单但有力——good. 自己搭帐篷是好的，煮豆子和面条吃也是好的，这一切都让Nick十分满足。接着他开始准备自己煮咖啡。在这个过程中，他想起了自己的一位旧友，一个叫作Hopkins的人。他们曾经就如何煮咖啡发生过争执，但现在，他竟不自觉地开始按照Hopkins的方法煮咖啡了——



💧**Clue 2**: Nick reminisces about his old friend.



**Evidence 1**: He could remember an argument about it with Hopkins, but not which side he had taken. He decided to bring it to a boil. He remembered now that was Hopkins’s way.

他只记得曾为这事跟霍普金斯争论过，但是记不得自己赞成用哪种方法了。他决定让咖啡煮沸。他现在想起来了，这正是霍普金斯的方法。



**Evidence 2**: It should be straight Hopkins all the way. Hop deserved that. He was a very serious coffee drinker. He was the most serious man Nick had ever known.

就应该把霍普金斯的办法用到底。霍普金斯应该得到这样的待遇。他是个非常认真的喝咖啡的人。这是尼克所认识的最认真的人。



Nick通过这种方式来怀念过去的好友。从现在的情况推测，他们已经失联很久。在这之前的某一天，Hopkins突然收到电报说他的一口油井出油了（the wire came that his first big well had come in），也就是Hopkins成了一个暴发户。这里对Hopkins的描述也可以看作是作者对于与自然对立的金钱和物质主义的一个暗示。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****Many Sauces**

**各种调味酱汁**

我们今天的内容当中有这样的情节：Nick拿出一瓶番茄酱，切了四片面包。（ Nick got out a bottle of tomato catchup and cut four slices of bread. ）接着他将番茄酱倒在食物上（ He poured on some tomato catchup. ），这里的 tomato catchup是指番茄酱，catchup同ketchup，我们今天就来一起看一下都有哪些调味酱汁吧～



\1. Ketchup 番茄蘸酱

Ketchup是番茄蘸酱，用来冷食，比如蘸薯条吃。其实除了食用的冷热这点不同外，ketchup和tomato sauce制作材料也不同。Ketchup配料中一般包括洋葱、玉米和醋。有些配料大家应该都没吃出来吧？美国人很喜欢用品牌来给东西命名，Ketchup是一个很有名的番茄酱牌子，于是大家都叫番茄酱叫ketchup了。



\2. Tomato Sauce 番茄酱

中文里同样被叫做番茄酱，但请大家不要把它和ketchup搞混，否则Tomato sauce可是要伤心的。因为人家它血统纯正，是法式经典菜肴5大基本酱汁之一。Tomato sauce其实是做热菜的酱汁，除了番茄，一般会有油、香草、蔬菜和肉糜，做意大利面的时候用上它，绝对棒！



\3. Mayonnaise 蛋黄酱

它就是大家经常吃的蛋黄酱，可以做沙拉调料（dressing），很百搭哦。蛋黄酱的主要成分是至少70%总重的植物油和蛋黄，配料是芥末酱（mustard）和柠檬汁，其实白醋也很好，当然盐和胡椒不能少。 



\4. Ranch 农场酱

Ranch一般翻译为农场酱，可以搭配新鲜蔬菜，它有着浓郁的洋葱和大蒜味，比蒜蓉酱（garlic sauce）更具有奶香味，层次也更丰富。它除了可以用来做色拉，也可以蘸薯条、鸡翅、玉米片吃。



\5. Sour Cream 酸奶油

酸奶油在墨西哥菜里运用的很多。它口感比蛋黄酱轻薄，口味略酸。不爱吃酸的人可以把酸奶油配合有芝士的食物一起吃，可以很好地综合掉腻的感觉。推荐吃法：一颗草莓蘸上红糖，再裹上酸奶油，就变成了极为受欢迎的甜品。



\6. Guacamole 鳄梨酱

Guacamole是南美洲阿兹特克文化里的传统酱料，用鳄梨（牛油果）、番茄、洋葱、香菜和辣椒粉（cayenne pepper）等制成，最流行的就是蘸着墨西哥玉米片（tortilla chips）吃，是一大派对美食。也可以加在面包或墨西哥卷饼里吃。词尾“mole”就是酱料的意思，这个词也随着文化而进入了西班牙语中。



\7. Béchamel/White sauce 白酱

Béchamel白酱常以White sauce之名出现在各式西餐中，是意大利面和焗菜必不可缺的酱汁。主要材料是黄油、牛奶和面粉，加上不同的食材就可以变化万千。比如加入Gruyère或Parmesan奶酪，就是芝士酱（mornay sauce）；加上奶油就是奶油酱（cream sauce）；加上蘑菇就是蘑菇酱（mushroom sauce）.



\8. Hummus 鹰嘴豆泥

鹰嘴豆泥既可以作为酱料，又可以作为开胃菜，常见于中东、阿拉伯菜肴。做法很简单，将鹰嘴豆磨成泥，加上芝麻酱、橄榄油和其他香料就完成了。很多阿拉伯人用皮塔饼（Pita）蘸著鹰嘴豆泥吃就是一顿饭了。

He was excited but serious. They said good-bye and all felt bad.

It broke up the trip. They never saw Hopkins again.

That was a long time ago on the Black River.

Nick drank the coffee, the coffee according to Hopkins.

The coffee was bitter. Nick laughed.It made a good ending to the story.

His mind was starting to work. He knew he could choke it because he was tired enough.

He spilled the coffee out of the pot and shook the grounds loose into the fire.

He lit a cigarette and went inside the tent.

He took off his shoes and trousers, sitting on the blankets, rolled the shoes up inside the trousers for a pillow and got in between the blankets.

Out through the front of the tent he watched the glow of the fire, when the night wind blew on it.

It was a quiet night. The swamp was perfectly quiet.

Nick stretched under the blanket comfortably.

A mosquito hummed close to his ear. Nick sat up and lit a match.

The mosquito was on the canvas, over his head. Nick moved the match quickly up to it.

The mosquito made a satisfactory hiss in the flame. The match went out.

Nick lay down again under the blanket. He turned on his side and shut his eyes.

He was sleepy. He felt sleep coming. He curled up under the blanket and went to sleep.

> <font color=red>He curled up under the blanket and went to sleep.</font>

In the morning the sun was up and the tent was starting to get hot.

Nick crawled out under the mosquito netting stretched across the mouth of the tent, to look at the morning.

The grass was wet on his hands as he came out. He held his trousers and his shoes in his hands.

The sun was just up over the hill. There was the meadow, the river and the swamp.

There were birch trees in the green of the swamp on the other side of the river.

The river was clear and smoothly fast in the early morning.

Down about two hundred yards were three logs all the way across the stream.

They made the water smooth and deep above them.

As Nick watched, a mink crossed the river on the logs and went into the swamp.

Nick was excited. He was excited by the early morning and the river.

He was really too hurried to eat breakfast, but he knew he must.

He built a little fire and put on the coffee pot.

> <font color=red>He built a little fire and put on the coffee pot.</font>

While the water was heating in the pot he took an empty bottle and went down over the edge of the high ground to the meadow.

The meadow was wet with dew and Nick wanted to catch grasshoppers for bait before the sun dried the grass.

> ==grasshopper英 [ˈgrɑ:shɒpə(r)] 美 [ˈgræshɑ:pə(r)] n. 蚱蜢；蝗虫==

He found plenty of good grasshoppers. They were at the base of the grass stems.

Sometimes they clung to a grass stem. They were cold and wet with the dew, and could not jump until the sun warmed them.

> 在整个审判中，她都坚持相信他是清白的。

Nick picked them up, taking only the medium-sized brown ones, and put them into the bottle.

He turned over a log and just under the shelter of the edge were several hundred hoppers.

It was a grasshopper lodging house.Nick put about fifty of the medium browns into the bottle.

While he was picking up the hoppers the others warmed in the sun and commenced to hop away.

They flew when they hopped. At first they made one flight and stayed stiff when they landed, as though they were dead.

Nick knew that by the time he was through with breakfast they would be as lively as ever.

Without dew in the grass it would take him all day to catch a bottle full of good grasshoppers and he would have to crush many of them, slamming at them with his hat.

He washed his hands at the stream.He was excited to be near it.

Then he walked up to the tent. The hoppers were already jumping stiffly in the grass.

In the bottle, warmed by the sun, they were jumping in a mass. Nick put in a pine stick as a cork.

It plugged the mouth of the bottle enough, so the hoppers could not get out and left plenty of air passage.

He had rolled the log back and knew he could get grasshoppers there every morning.

Nick laid the bottle full of jumping grasshoppers against a pine trunk.

Rapidly he mixed some buckwheat flour with water and stirred it smooth, one cup of flour, one cup of water.

He put a handful of coffee in the pot and dipped a lump of grease out of a can and slid it sputtering across the hot skillet.

> ==sputter英 [ˈspʌtə(r)] 美 [ˈspʌtɚ] vi. 发出啪啪声，毕剥作响 n. 劈啪声；慌乱的说话方式==

On the smoking skillet he poured smoothly the buckwheat batter.

It spread like lava, the grease spitting sharply.

Around the edges the buckwheat cake began to firm, then brown, then crisp.

The surface was bubbling slowly to porousness. Nick pushed under the browned under surface with a fresh pine chip.

He shook the skillet sideways and the cake was loose on the surface. I won’t try and flop it, he thought.

He slid the chip of clean wood all the way under the cake, and flopped it over onto its face. It sputtered in the pan.

> ==flop英 [flɒp] 美 [flɑ:p] vi. 猛然坐下或躺下；摔落；失败 n. 惨败；失败之作；扑通声==

When it was cooked Nick regreasedthe skillet. He used all the batter.

It made another big flapjack and one smaller one.

Nick ate a big flapjack and a smaller one, covered with apple butter.

He put apple butter on the third cake, folded it over twice, wrapped it in oiled paper and put it in his shirt pocket.

He put the apple butter jar back in the pack and cut bread for two sandwiches.

In the pack he found a big onion. He sliced it in two and peeled the silky outer skin.

Then he cut one half into slices and made onion sandwiches.

He wrapped them in oiled paper and buttoned them in the other pocket of his khaki shirt.

He turned the skillet upside down on the grill, drank the coffee, sweetened and yellow brown with the condensed milk in it, and tidied up the camp. It was a good camp.

> ==condensed英 [kən'denst] 美 [kənˈdɛnst] adj. 精简的；浓缩的==

Nick took his fly rod out of the leather rod-case, jointed it, and shoved the rod-case back into the tent.

He put on the reel and threaded theline through the guides.

He had to hold it from hand to hand, as he threaded it, or it would slip back through its own weight.

It was a heavy, double tapered fly line.

Nick had paid eight dollars for it a long time ago.

It was made heavy to lift back in the air and come forward flat and heavyand straight to make it possible to cast a fly which has no weight.

Nick opened the aluminum leader box.

The leaders were coiled between the damp flannel pads.

Nick had wet the pads at the water cooler on the train up to St. Ignace.

In the damp pads the gut leaders had softened and Nick unrolled one and tied it by a loop at the end to the heavy fly line.

He fastened a hook on the end of the leader.

It was a small hook; very thin and springy.

Nick took it from his hook book, sitting with the rod across his lap.

He tested the knot and the spring ofthe rod by pulling the line taut.

It was a good feeling. He was careful not to let the hook bite into his finger.

He started down to the stream, holding his rod, the bottle of grasshoppers hung from his neck bya thong tied in half hitches around the neck of the bottle.

> ==hitch英 [hɪtʃ] 美 [hɪtʃ] vt.&vi. 搭便车；向上拉；攀爬；套住 n. 小故障；(某种)结==

His landing net hung by a hook from his belt.

Over his shoulder was a long flour sack tied at each corner into an ear.

The cord went over his shoulder. The sack flapped against his legs.

Nick felt awkward and professionally happy with all his equipment hanging from him.

The grasshopper bottle swung against his chest.

In his shirt the breast pockets bulged against him with the lunch and his fly book.

> ==bulge英 [bʌldʒ] 美 [bʌldʒ] vi. 鼓起；凸出；塞满 n. 凸起；鼓起部分；骤增；暴涨==

He stepped into the stream. It was a shock. His trousers clung tight to his legs.

His shoes felt the gravel. The water was a rising cold shock.

Rushing, the current sucked against his legs.

Where he stepped in, the water wasover his knees.

He waded with the current. The gravel slid under his shoes.

He looked down at the swirl of water below each leg and tipped up the bottle to get a grasshopper.

He was sucked under in the whirl by Nick’s right leg and came to the surface a little way down stream.

He floated rapidly, kicking. In a quick circle, breaking the smooth surface of the water, he disappeared. A trout had taken him.

### 背景知识

**💧****北美五大湖**

**Great Lakes**

*Big Two-Hearted River*（《大双心河》）这个短篇讲述的是Nick在参加大战后，身心受到损伤，回到密执安州北部少年时代常去的钓鱼之地。美国东北部的密执安州处于美国和加拿大交界处的五大湖地带。该州北部为一东西向的大半岛，北面以苏必利尔湖与加拿大为界，南面为密执安湖及休伦湖。我们今天的内容中也出现了Hopkins想要买游艇，带大家一起沿着苏必利尔湖的北岸航行。（He would get a yacht and they would all cruise along the north shore of Lake Superior. ）



北美五大湖是世界最大的淡水湖群，即北美洲的苏必利尔湖、密歇根湖、休伦湖、伊利湖和安大略湖五个相连湖泊的总称，有“北美大陆地中海”之称。我们今天就来了解一下美国著名的五大湖吧～

\1. 苏必利尔湖（Lake Superior）



是北美洲五大湖最西北和最大的一个，也是世界面积最大的淡水湖，是世界第二大湖。湖东北面为加拿大，西南面为美国。湖面东西长616千米，南北最宽处257千米，有近200条河流注入湖中，以尼皮贡和圣路易斯河为最大。湖中主要岛屿有罗亚尔岛（美国国家公园之一)、阿波斯特尔群岛等等。



沿湖多林地，风景秀丽，人口稀少。苏必利尔湖水质清澈，湖面多风浪，湖区冬寒夏凉。季节性渔猎和旅游为当地娱乐业主要项目。还蕴藏有多种矿物。有很多天然港湾和人工港口。全年通航期为8个月。该湖1622年为法国探险家发现，湖名取自法语，意为“上湖”。



\2. 休伦湖（Lake Huron）

为北美五大湖中第二大湖，在五大湖中位置居中。它由西北向东南延伸，自北接纳了苏必利尔湖及密歇根湖，南经底特律旁边的圣克莱尔湖、底特律河流入伊利湖。湖区东北部多岛屿，其中包括世界上最大的湖岛马尼图林岛。岛上湖沼众多，更是形成了世界之最的湖中湖——马尼图林湖。湖区主要经济活动有伐木业和渔业。沿湖多游览区。4月初至12月末为通航季节。休伦湖是第一个为欧洲人所发现的湖泊，名源出休伦族印第安人。



\3. 密歇根湖（Lake Michigan）

也叫密执安湖，是北美五大湖中面积居第三位，唯一全部属于美国的湖泊。东北西南走向，湖北部与休伦湖相通，南北长517千米，最宽处190千米，湖岸线长2100千米。有约100条小河注入其中，北端多岛屿，以比弗岛为最大。

湖区气候温和，冬季虽港湾封冻，但湖面却极少全面绅冰，全年有轮渡往来。沿湖岸边有湖波冲蚀而成的悬崖，东南岸多有沙丘，尤以印第安纳国家湖滨区和州立公园的沙丘最为著名。东岸水果产区颇有名，以苹果、桃、梨为代表。北岸曲折多港湾，湖中多鳟鱼、鲑鱼，垂钓业兴旺。南端的芝加哥为重要的工业城市，并有加里、马斯基根等很多港口。



\4. 伊利湖（Lake Erie）

是北美五大湖的第四大湖，东、西、南面为美国，北面为加拿大。湖水面积25667平方千米。呈西南——东北走向，平均深度18米，最深64米，是五大湖中最浅的一个，蓄水量455立方千米。底特律河、休伦河等众多河流注入其中，湖水由东端经尼亚加拉河排出。岛屿集中在湖的西端，以加拿大的皮利岛为最大，岛上有加拿大皮利角国家公园。北岸多农业平原，周围人口密集，城市众多。



\5. 安大略湖（Lake Ontario）

是北美洲五大湖最东和最小的一个，名字来自易洛魁语skanadario，意思是“美丽之湖”。北为加拿大，南是美国，大致成椭圆形。有尼亚加拉、杰纳西等河流注入，经韦兰运河和尼亚加拉河与伊利湖连接。著名的尼亚加拉大瀑布上接伊利湖，下灌安大略湖，两湖落差99米。湖水由东端流入圣劳伦斯河。安大略湖北面为农业平原，工业集中在港口城市圣凯瑟琳、多伦多、金斯顿等。港湾每年12月至来年4月不通航。

### 课文理解

今天内容的开头接着昨天的故事，Nick回忆起过去的一个好友Hopkins，他因为油井而突然成为了暴发户。最后他承诺的很多约定还没兑现就离开了（The Hop Head was rich. He would get a yacht and they would all cruise along the north shore of Lake Superior. He was excited but serious. They said good-bye and all felt bad. It broke up the trip.）自此，Hopkins的朋友再没见到过他。Nick对于这些回忆并没有感觉痛苦，相反地，他对于一切的结束态度很平和，也非常自得于当下的状态——

💧**Clue 1**: Nick is content with the present.



**Evidence 1**: The coffee was bitter. Nick laughed. It made a good ending to the story. His mind was starting to work. He knew he could choke it because he was tired enough.

咖啡很苦。尼克笑笑。故事这样结束，倒是很不错。他的头脑开始转动起来了。他知道，他可以把这思路阻断，因为他太累了。



**Evidence 2**: The mosquito was on the canvas, over his head. Nick moved the match quickly up to it. The mosquito made a satisfactory hiss in the flame. The match went out. Nick lay down again under the blanket.

蚊子立在他头顶的帆布帐篷上。尼克点着火柴去烧蚊子。蚊子在火中发出嘶的一声，这声音听来叫人快慰。火柴熄了。尼克再次盖上毯子躺了下来。



一晚好眠后，Nick第二天的计划是去钓鱼。从一大早起他就开始准备：捉蚱蜢当鱼饵、烹饪食物等等。作者花了相当的笔墨描述这个准备过程，还写到了Nick如何仔细地端详他的钓竿，这些细节都说明了Nick是在非常慎重细致地准备开展钓鱼这项活动——



💧**Clue 2**: Nick prepares the fishing carefully.



**Evidence 1**: Nick took it from his hook book, sitting with the rod across his lap. He tested the knot and the spring of the rod by pulling the line taut. It was a good feeling. He was careful not to let the hook bite into his finger.

尼克坐在那里，钓竿横在膝上，从农钓钩匣中取出这个钓钩。他把钩线拉紧，看看这个结打得牢不牢，看看钓竿的弹性怎么样。这是一种很好的感觉。他非常小心，不让钓钩钩到手指。



**Evidence 2**: Nick felt awkward and professionally happy with all his equipment hanging from him. The grasshopper bottle swung against his chest. In his shirt the breast pockets bulged against him with the lunch and his fly book.

身上挂着这么些东西，尼克感到走路有些别扭，但是又觉得自己好像成了一个行家，心里很开心。那瓶蚱蜢摇晃着，打着他的前胸。衬衫口袋鼓鼓的，塞在里面的是他提前做好的午饭和盛着假蝇的小匣。



Nick做这些事情的时候，刻意地增加了仪式感。可以猜测，钓鱼也是他恢复战争创收并且重拾对生活的积极信心中的重要一步。

**💧****Various Special Cakes**

**国外各种特色“饼”**

我们今天的内容中有Nick自己用煎锅（skillet）烤荞麦饼（buckwheat cake）的情节（Rapidly he mixed some buckwheat flour with water and stirred it smooth, one cup of flour, one cup of water...On the smoking skillet he poured smoothly the buckwheat batter. It spread like lava, the grease spitting sharply. Around the edges the buckwheat cake began to firm, then brown, then crisp... 他迅速地用水和着一些荞麦面，搅得很均匀，用量是一杯面加一杯水......他把荞麦糊滑溜地倒进这冒烟的煎锅。它像岩浆般扩散开来，牛油清脆地卜卜发响。荞麦饼的四周变得硬起来，然后发黄，然后发脆......) 我们今天来一起看一下国外有哪些独具特色的“饼”吧～



\1. 松饼（Muffin）



平时我们爱吃的“松饼”，被翻译成英文叫做“muffin”，再翻译过来就变成了“英格兰松饼”、“杯状小松糕”、“马芬蛋糕”。所有以纸杯作为模具的蛋糕都被叫做纸杯蛋糕（cupcake）， muffin cupcake也属于其中一种，muffin的面糊中含有黄油、鸡蛋、糖、低粉和泡打粉，口感会比戚风蛋糕（Chiffon Cake）浓厚很多。



最常见的muffin有巧克力muffin、香蕉muffin、蔓越莓muffin、柠檬muffin，有些甚至可以做成咸的，例如蔬菜muffin、芝士蒜香muffin…



\2. 华夫饼（Waffle）

华夫饼不管做成圆的还是方的，它都是带格子的，香港人喜欢叫它格子饼。华夫饼由发酵的面糊，倒入一边带模具的烤盘中，再盖上另一边烤盘，加热烘烤几分钟制成。新鲜出炉的华夫饼是脆脆的，不同地方有不同的吃法。美国的华夫饼口感紧密，外表看上去比较薄，通常会混合山核桃、巧克力或浆果，配上黄油、枫糖浆、培根、糖粉、蜂蜜或其他果酱。美国人喜欢把它们当成早餐。



\3. 煎饼（Pancake）

一般来说，我们所说的松饼应该是Pancake，最正统的叫法是煎饼或者薄烤饼。煎饼是一种扁平的蛋糕，用淀粉制成，含有鸡蛋、牛奶和黄油，在热的平底锅（Pan）上用油或是黄油煎，因此得名Pancake。煎饼的厚度可以自己定，但一般都偏向于薄，最经典的煎饼最外层皮是金黄色，或是微焦带点棕色，内部柔软，多孔且富有弹性。



\4.  可丽饼（Crepe）

可丽饼是一种法式煎饼，又被叫做法式薄饼，以小麦粉为原材料，比英式煎饼更薄。在煎的时候，其他煎饼是两面都煎，而可丽饼只煎一面，煎成一大张饼后折成扇形。可丽饼在国内以甜口味为主，吃法多种多样，可以卷上各种奶油、水果、巧克力酱等等。在法国，可丽饼也可以是咸的，除了可以包裹奶油水果冰激凌，或撒上糖粉，还可以包裹鸡蛋、火腿、奶酪、蔬菜、鱼肉......



\5. 荷兰煎饼（Pannenkoeken）

是荷兰最普遍也最受欢迎的风味餐点,有点类似法国的可丽饼，又有点像意大利的披萨。将奶、蛋、和面粉稍微煎成饼后，放入已熏好的培根、火腿、奶酪，及切成薄片的苹果、葡萄干、香蕉等各式水果，最后淋上黑枫糖浆（maple syrup），又咸又甜，十分特别。



\6.  热香饼（Hotcakes）

在北美，煎饼又被叫做hotcakes，用发酵粉使煎饼发酵，因此会厚一些。配煎饼的酱汁和配料就多了，糖粉、果酱、冰淇淋、水果、坚果、蜂蜜…...  美式煎饼最常见的吃法是在原味的Pancake上淋上一层加拿大的枫糖浆，而且是加热后的枫糖浆，饼里的奶香味与蛋香味在枫糖浆的作用下越发清晰，层层递进。

Big Two-Hearted River

Another hopper poked his face out of the bottle. His antenna wavered.

He was getting his front legs out of the bottle to jump.

Nick took him by the head and held him while he threaded the slim hookunder his chin, down through his thorax and into the last segments ofhis abdomen.

The grasshopper took hold of the hook with his front feet, spitting tobacco juice on it. Nick dropped him into the water.

Holding the rod in his right hand he let out line against the pull of the grasshopper in the current.

He stripped off line from the reel with his left hand and let it run free.

He could see the hopper in the littlewaves of the current.

It went out of sight. There was a tugon the line.

Nick pulled against the taut line. It was his first strike.

Holding the now living rod across the current, he brought in the line with his left hand.

The rod bent in jerks, the trout pumping against the current.

Nick knew it was a small one. He lifted the rod straight up in the air. Itbowed with the pull.

He saw the trout in the water jerking with his head and body against the shifting tangent of the line in the stream.

Nick took the line in his left hand and pulled the trout, thumping tiredly against the current, to the surface.

His back was mottled the clear, water-over-gravel color, his side flashing in the sun.

The rod under his right arm, Nick stooped, dipping his right hand into the current.

He held the trout, never still, with his moist right hand, while he unhooked the barb from his mouth, then dropped him back into the stream.

He hung unsteadily in the current, then settled to the bottom beside a stone.

Nick reached down his hand to touch him, his arm to the elbow under water.

The trout was steady in the moving stream, resting on the gravel, beside a stone.

As Nick’s fingers touched him, touched his smooth, cool, underwater feeling he was gone, gone in a shadow across the bottom of the stream.

He’s all right, Nick thought. He was only tired.

He had wet his hand before he touched the trout, so he would not disturb the delicate mucus that covered him.

If a trout was touched with a dry hand, a white fungus attacked the unprotected spot.

> ==fungus英 [ˈfʌŋgəs] 美 [ˈfʌŋɡəs] n. 真菌；真菌类==

Years before when he had fished crowded streams, with fly fishermen ahead of him and behind him, Nick had again and again come on dead trout, furry with white fungus, drifted against a rock, or floating belly up insome pool.

He did not rebait his hook and held it in his hand as he waded.

He was certain he could catch smalltrout in the shallows, but he did not want them.

There would be no big trout in the shallows this time of day.

Now the water deepened up his thighs sharply and coldly.

Ahead was the smooth dammed-back flood of water above the logs.

The water was smooth and dark; onthe left, the lower edge of the meadow; on the right the swamp.

Nick leaned back against the current and took a hopper from the bottle.

He threaded the hopper on the hook and spat on him for good luck.

Then he pulled several yards of linefrom the reel and tossed the hopperout ahead onto the fast, dark water.

It floated down towards the logs, then the weight of the line pulled the bait under the surface.

Nick held the rod in his right hand, letting the line run out through his fingers.

There was a long tug. Nick struck and the rod came alive and dangerous, bent double, the line tightening, coming out of water, tightening, all in a heavy, dangerous, steady pull.

Nick felt the moment when the leader would break if the strain increased and let the line go.

The reel ratcheted into a mechanical shriek as the line went out in a rush.

Too fast. Nick could not check it, the line rushing out, the reel note rising as the line ran out.

With the core of the reel showing, his heart feeling stopped with the excitement, leaning back against thecurrent that mounted icily his thighs,Nick thumbed the reel hard with his left hand.

It was awkward getting his thumb inside the fly reel frame.

As he put on pressure the line tightened into sudden hardness and beyond the logs a huge trout went high out of water.

As he jumped, Nick lowered the tip of the rod.

But he felt, as he dropped the tip to ease the strain, the moment when the strain was too great; the hardness too tight.

Of course, the leader had broken. There was no mistaking the feeling when all spring left the line and it became dry and hard.

Then it went slack. His mouth dry, his heart down, Nick reeled in.

> <font color=red>Then it went slack.</font>

He had never seen so big a trout. There was a heaviness, a power not to be held, and then the bulk of him, as he jumped.

He looked as broad as a salmon.

> ==salmon英 [ˈsæmən] 美 [ˈsæmən] n. 鲑鱼；鲑鱼肉；橙红色==

Nick’s hand was shaky. He reeled in slowly.

The thrill had been too much. He felt, vaguely, a little sick, as though it would be better to sit down.

The leader had broken where the hook was tied to it.

Nick took it in his hand. He thought of the trout somewhere on the bottom, holding himself steady over the gravel, far down below the light, under the logs, with the hook in his jaw.

Nick knew the trout’s teeth would cut through the snell of the hook.

The hook would imbed itself in his jaw. He’d bet the trout was angry.

Anything that size would be angry. That was a trout.

He had been solidly hooked. Solid as a rock.

He felt like a rock, too, before he started off.

By God, he was a big one. By God,he was the biggest one I ever heardof.

Nick climbed out onto the meadow and stood, water running down his trousers and out of his shoes, his shoes squelchy.

He went over and sat on the logs. He did not want to rush his sensations any.

He wriggled his toes in the water, inhis shoes, and got out a cigarette from his breast pocket.

He lit it and tossed the match into the fast water below the logs.

A tiny trout rose at the match, as it swung around in the fast current.

Nick laughed. He would finish the cigarette.

He sat on the logs, smoking, drying in the sun, the sun warm on his back, the river shallow ahead entering the woods, curving into the woods, shallows, light glittering, big water-smooth rocks, cedars along the bank and white birches,

the logs warm in the sun, smooth tosit on, without bark, gray to the touch; slowly the feeling of disappointment left him.

It went away slowly, the feeling of disappointment that came sharply after the thrill that made his shoulders ache.

It was all right now. His rod lying out on the logs, Nick tied a new hook on the leader, pulling the gut tight until it grimped into itself in a hard knot.

He baited up, then picked up the rod and walked to the far end of thelogs to get into the water, where it was not too deep.

Under and beyond the logs was a deep pool.

Nick walked around the shallow shelf near the swamp shore until hecame out on the shallow bed of the stream.

On the left, where the meadow ended and the woods began, a great elm tree was uprooted.

Gone over in a storm, it lay back into the woods, its roots clotted withdirt, grass growing in them, rising a solid bank beside the stream.

The river cut to the edge of the uprooted tree.

From where Nick stood he could see deep channels, like ruts, cut in the shallow bed of the stream by the flow of the current.

Pebbly where he stood and pebbly and full of boulders beyond; where it curved near the tree roots, the bed of the stream was marly and between the ruts of deep water green weed fronds swung in the current.

Nick swung the rod back over his shoulder and forward, and the line, curving forward, laid the grasshopper down on one of the deep channels in the weeds.

A trout struck and Nick hooked him.

### 背景知识

**💧****Salmon**

**三文鱼？鲑鱼？**

我们今天的内容中一直围绕着Nick来到河边垂钓来讲述，（He had never seen so big a trout. There was a heaviness, a power not to be held, and then the bulk of him, as he jumped. He looked as broad as a salmon. 他从没见过这样大的鳟鱼，分量很沉，力气大得拉不住，再说，它跳起来时露出的个头多大啊。它看上去象鲑鱼般宽阔。）这里trout是指“鳟鱼”，salmon是指“鲑鱼”，我们生活中常见的三文鱼译为salmon，我们今天来一起了解一下三文鱼吧～



说起三文鱼，我们脑海中肯定会浮现出以下关键词：日料、刺身。超市的生鲜柜台里，三文鱼鱼腩、鱼头，鱼骨，以及一盒又一盒的三文鱼寿司摆放整齐，等着被吃掉。

三文鱼（salmon），来源于拉丁语中的“salmo”，意为奋力跃起。之所以取这样的名字，源于三文鱼的洄游特征。每年到了产卵期，它们千里逆流，甚至还要跳跃和冲撞数十英尺高的障碍，只为回到当初出生的河流产卵。



18世纪，生物命名法的创立者林奈把这种鱼的学名形象地定为“salmo salar”，也就是现在的鲑鱼属大西洋鲑。而大西洋鲑以外的各种“三文鱼”，中国人给它们起了一个更通俗的名字——大马哈鱼。市面上的三文鱼种类很多，有挪威的、芬兰的、美国阿拉斯加产三文鱼。挪威是世界上最大的大西洋三文鱼生产国，出口到世界上上百个国家。买的时候看清产地即可，不需要过多挑剔。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/61756928ab92a3386b3e58c86e788326-sz_178162.png)



在英文世界里“Salmon”不光指大西洋鲑，还指太平洋鲑属的很多种鱼。为了进一步区分，又在统称前加上了产地、形态等特征，诸如Pink salmon（粉三文鱼）、Coho salmon（银三文鱼）、Sockeye salmon（红三文鱼）等众多鱼种。

而经常冒充三文鱼的虹鳟鱼虽属于太平洋鲑属，但虹鳟的通用英文名是rainbow trout，trout对应的概念是“鳟鱼”，指的是大马哈鱼属和鲑鱼属的鱼中，生活史全部于淡水中完成，没有跨盐度洄游行为的一个类群。价格便宜 + 肉色偏红+ 刺身厚度薄+ 脂肪纹理窄且很清晰+ 肉表面无光泽的所谓三文鱼，通常就是虹鳟鱼。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/2177f13721ec5202806a05472326b41d-sz_158853.png)



三文鱼最为常见的，就是架在冰块上，以刺身生吃，沾着日本酱油与青芥末，再搭配点白萝卜丝解腻，或卷着一起吃。生吃三文鱼，确实是营养价值最高、吸收最好的吃法。



野生的三文鱼是有寄生虫的。所以，吃生鱼片会有得寄生虫病的危险，日本是发达国家中寄生虫病高发国家。但是，实际生活中，我们并非把单纯的野生的三文鱼直接生吃。三文鱼食用前用低温冷冻可杀灭寄生虫，通常可以用零下30摄氏度左右的低温，急速冷冻保存24个小时左右。



如果不太接受生吃方法，或不能完全保证三文鱼非常新鲜的情况下可以选择熟吃的方法，但为了尽量保留其中的营养，最好是五成熟即食。推荐两种吃法：一种是涮食，在大约70度左右的汤中，薄的肉片沾过即可食用；另外可以微煎，将三文鱼切近一厘米左右的厚度，在少油的煎锅中将两面微微煎黄即可。

### 课文理解

Nick起先钓到了一只鳟鱼，但他觉得不够大，所以又把这条鳟鱼放生了（...he unhooked the barb from his mouth, then dropped him back into the stream）. 这里有一个细节说明了Nick和其他垂钓者的不同，他对自然更存敬畏和爱护之心，也更有道德责任感——



💧**Clue 1**: Nick sets himself apart from other fishermen.



**Evidence 1**: He had wet his hand before he touched the trout, so he would not disturb the delicate mucus that covered him. If a trout was touched with a dry hand, a white fungus attacked the unprotected spot.

他先弄湿了手才去摸那鳟鱼，这样才不会弄坏覆盖在鱼身上的那一层薄薄的黏液。如果干手去摸鳟鱼，黏液被弄破的地方就会被白色真菌感染。



**Evidence 2**: Nick did not like to fish with other men on the river. Unless they were of your party, they spoiled it.

尼克不喜欢跟别人一起在河边钓鱼。除非大家是一伙的，否则有些人总使人扫兴。



这里说的“一伙”（of your party）其实就是指像Nick这样爱护生灵并且有道德感的垂钓者，可以看出来Nick骨子里有很强的正义感。



接着Nick继续寻找可以钓到大鳟鱼的地方（He was certain he could catch small trout in the shallows, but he did not want them. There would be no big trout in the shallows this time of day.）他开始往深水的区域前进。果然在这里有一只大鱼上了钩，但随之而来的是一场悲伤的意外，接钩绳因为无法承受压力直接绷断了（Of course, the leader had broken.）Nick这时候表现出了既有沮丧又有快意的复杂情感——



💧**Clue 2**: Nick feels at once depressed and thrilled.



**Evidence 1**: His mouth dry, his heart down, Nick reeled in. He had never seen so big a trout. There was a heaviness, a power not to be held, and then the bulk of him, as he jumped.

尼克嘴巴发干，心情低沉，把钓线收起来，绕到卷轴上。他从来没见过这样大的鳟鱼，分量真重，力气真大，拉也拉不住，还有，它跳起来的时候，那块头多大啊。



**Evidence 2**: Nick’s hand was shaky. He reeled in slowly. The thrill had been too much. He felt, vaguely, a little sick, as though it would be better to sit down.

尼克的手在发抖。他慢慢地收起钓线，绕到卷轴上。这实在太刺激了。恍惚之间，他感到一点点恶心，还是坐下来为好。



这一条大鳟鱼就像我们人生中曾经憧憬向往并短暂拥有的幸福，但却一不小心被夺走了，并且无法失而复得。对于Nick来说也是如此，他有过的青春美好，随着战争的来临，都被湮没甚至摧毁掉了。而他如此地想要使一切恢复原样，也难免因为希冀过高而出现失望。



但是他的钓鱼旅程还没有结束。明天是我们这篇故事的结尾部分，Nick的态度是否会发生转变，他最后能不能治愈自己在战争中所受的创伤呢？

**💧**美国森林旅行

Forest Travelling in America



我们今天的内容中有Nick在森林边的场景：他坐在圆木上，抽着烟，在阳光里晒干裤腿，太阳晒得他背脊很暖和，前面的河边浅滩钻进树林，弯弯曲曲地进入树林，望着这些浅滩，闪闪发亮的阳光，被水冲得很光滑的大石块，河边的雪松和白桦树，被阳光晒暖的圆木，光滑可坐，没有树起，摸上去很古老。（He sat on the logs, smoking, drying in the sun, the sun warm on his back, the river shallow ahead entering the woods, curving into the woods, shallows, light glittering, big water-smooth rocks, cedars along the bank and white birches, the logs warm in the sun, smooth to sit on, without bark, gray to the touch; slowly the feeling of disappointment left him.）森林旅行在现在越来越流行，森林公园成为了大家在这个喧嚣的世界放松身心的好去处。



美国可以说是森林旅游的鼻祖，1872年被正式命名的黄石国家公园算是森林旅游的前身，二战之后，依托森林发展旅游的趋势逐渐兴起，到1960年，森林旅游的现实价值获得了各界人士的承认，并一跃成了森林资源开发的主要部分之一。



森林旅游是指人们以森林、湿地、荒漠和野生动植物资源及其外部物质环境为依托，开展的观光游览、休闲度假、健身养生、文化教育等旅游活动。目前森林旅游度假的一些类型包括：度假村项目、露营地和私人度假社区等。



\1. 通加斯国家森林（Tongass National Forest）Alaska



通加斯国家森林是美国最大的国家森林，占地六百八十万公顷，面积是美国第二大国家森林的三倍。通加斯国家森林包含19个自然保护区、阿德默勒尔蒂群岛国家纪念公园、以及薄雾峡湾国家风景区。



它拥有美国境内现存最大的巨树保留区，以及全球仅存老龄温带雨林的将近三分之一，且树龄悠久至最高800年岁数的云杉、铁木衫、西洋杉。因其地理形势和气候条件形成大量冰河、结冰区。太平洋里的五种野生鲑鱼都能在通加斯国家森林的河里看到，还有其他如比目鱼等鱼种。



\2. 吉福德·平肖国家森林（Gifford Pinchot National Forest ）Washington



吉福德·平肖国家森林因有许多几万年前因火山爆发而形成的隧道、山洞等而出名，其中长达2.5英里长的“猿洞”最受观光客欢迎，其太平洋峰步道也是许多健行登山客的最爱。 你可以在吉福德·平肖国家森林中许多的河流里看到各种不同的鲑鱼及鳟鱼，在森林间也有机会一睹驼鹿、黑熊、山羊、山猫的踪迹。



3.科科尼诺国家森林（Coconino National Forest）Arizona



科科尼诺国家森林位于亚利桑那州，是一片全美知名、涵盖最多元生态的高海拔森林。树木生长在12000米的高山上。主要的树种是山杨和黄松，树叶交相辉印，构成一幅美丽的彩绘画。科科尼诺国家森林之所以如此命名是因为它穿过了莫戈永和科科尼诺高原。从知名的红岩、松木林、到高山苔原，都能在科科尼诺国家森林一次满足你的探索。



\4. 毗斯迦山国家森林（Pisgah National Forests） North Carolina



毗斯迦山国家森林最吸引人的是随季节变化色彩、满山满谷的簇叶，宛如大自然替这森林画上的美丽地毯。长达200英里的健行步道，是吸引游客前来散步、慢跑、欣赏自然美景的人气之选。



5.大提顿国家森林（Bridger-Teton National Forest）Wyoming



大提顿国家森林为目前世界上最大、最完整的温带生态系统之一，在森林里以大陆分水岭界分了约有120万英亩的联邦保护生态地区。其中最热门的景点为一条由1925年一场不知名的山崩造成的5英里长的下滑河川（Gros Ventre Slide Geologic Area）还可能看到麋鹿、大角羊、灰熊、山猫、秃鹰、驼鹿，森林主要涵盖树种有山杨、道格拉斯冷杉、松树林、云杉、和白皮松。



\6. 西波拉国家森林（Cibola National Forest）New Mexico



从北连至新墨西哥中部，西波拉国家森林总长一千六百万英亩、海拔一万一千三百英尺，被誉为广阔的天空岛。有四个保护林区，为麋鹿、驼鹿、黑熊、山猫等动物之栖息地。

Big Two-Hearted River

Holding the rod far out toward the uprooted tree and sloshing backward in the current, Nick worked the trout, plunging, the rod bending alive, out of the danger of the weeds into the open river.

Holding the rod, pumping alive against the current, Nick brought thetrout in.

He rushed, but always came, the spring of the rod yielding to the rushes, sometimes jerking under water, but always bringing him in.

Nick eased downstream with the rushes. The rod above his head he led the trout over the net, then lifted.

The trout hung heavy in the net, mottled trout back and silver sides in the meshes.

Nick unhooked him; heavy sides, good to hold, big undershot jaw, and slipped him, heaving and big sliding, into the long sack that hung from his shoulders in the water.

Nick spread the mouth of the sack against the current and it filled, heavy with water.

He held it up, the bottom in the stream, and the water poured out through the sides.

Inside at the bottom was the big trout, alive in the water.

Nick moved downstream. The sack out ahead of him sunk heavy in the water, pulling from his shoulders.

It was getting hot, the sun hot on the back of his neck.

Nick had one good trout. He did not care about getting many trout.

Now the stream was shallow and wide. There were trees along both banks.

The trees of the left bank made short shadows on the current in the forenoon sun.

Nick knew there were trout in each shadow.

In the afternoon, after the sun had crossed toward the hills, the trout would be in the cool shadows on the other side of the stream.

The very biggest ones would lie up close to the bank.

> <font color=red>The very biggest ones would lie up close to the bank.</font>

You could always pick them up there on the Black.

When the sun was down they all moved out into the current.

Just when the sun made the water blinding in the glare before it went down, you were liable to strike a bigtrout anywhere in the current.

It was almost impossible to fish then, the surface of the water was blinding as a mirror in the sun.

Of course, you could fish upstream, but in a stream like the Black, or this, you had to wallow against the current and in a deep place, the water piled up on you.

It was no fun to fish upstream with this much current.

Nick moved along through the shallow stretch watching the banks for deep holes.

A beech tree grew close beside the river, so that the branches hung down into the water.

> <font color=red>A beech tree grew close beside the river, so that the branches hung down into the water.</font>

The stream went back in under the leaves.

There were always trout in a place like that.

Nick did not care about fishing that hole.

He was sure he would get hooked in the branches.

> <font color=red>He was sure he would get hooked in the branches.</font>

It looked deep though. He dropped the grasshopper so the current took it under water, back in under the overhanging branch.

The line pulled hard and Nick struck. The trout threshed heavily, half out of water in the leaves and branches.

The line was caught. Nick pulled hard and the trout was off.

He reeled in and holding the hook in his hand, walked down the stream.

Ahead, close to the left bank, was a big log.

Nick saw it was hollow; pointing up river the current entered it smoothly,only a little ripple spread each side of the log.

The water was deepening. The top of the hollow log was gray and dry. It was partly in the shadow.

Nick took the cork out of the grasshopper bottle and a hopper clung to it. He picked him off, hooked him and tossed him out.

He held the rod far out so that the hopper on the water moved into the current flowing into the hollow log.

Nick lowered the rod and the hopper floated in.

There was a heavy strike. Nick swung the rod against the pull.

It felt as though he were hooked into the log itself, except for the live feeling.

He tried to force the fish out into the current. It came, heavily.

The line went slack and Nick thought the trout was gone.

Then he saw him, very near, in the current, shaking his head, trying to get the hook out.

His mouth was clamped shut. He was fighting the hook in the clear flowing current.

Looping in the line with his left hand, Nick swung the rod to make the line taut and tried to lead the trout toward the net, but he was gone, out of sight, the line pumping.

Nick fought him against the current, letting him thump in the water against the spring of the rod.

> ==thump==
>
> v. 撞击（to fall on or hit a surface hard, with a loud dull sound; to make sth do this）
>
> 原文：Nick fought him against the current, letting him thump in the water against the spring of the rod.

> 💧thump作动词时，还有“（心脏）怦怦跳”的意思，比如：My heart was thumping wildly but I didn't let my face show any emotion.
>
> 我的心在狂跳不已，但是我仍面不改色。

He shifted the rod to his left hand, worked the trout upstream, holding his weight, fighting on the rod, and then let him down into the net.

He lifted him clear of the water, a heavy half circle in the net, the net dripping, unhooked him and slid him into the sack.

He spread the mouth of the sack and looked down in at the two big trout alive in the water.

Through the deepening water, Nick waded over to the hollow log.

He took the sack off, over his head, the trout flopping as it came out of water, and hung it so the trout were deep in the water.

Then he pulled himself up on the log and sat, the water from his trouser and boots running down into the stream.

He laid his rod down, moved along to the shady end of the log and took the sandwiches out of his pocket.

He dipped the sandwiches in the cold water. The current carried away the crumbs.

He ate the sandwiches and dipped his hat full of water to drink, the water running out through his hat just ahead of his drinking.

It was cool in the shade, sitting on the log.

He took a cigarette out and struck amatch to light it.

The match sunk into the gray wood,making a tiny furrow.

Nick leaned over the side of the log,found a hard place and lit the match.

He sat smoking and watching the river.

Ahead the river narrowed and went into a swamp.

The river became smooth and deep and the swamp looked solid with cedar trees, their trunks close together, their branches solid.

It would not be possible to walk through a swamp like that. The branches grew so low.

You would have to keep almost level with the ground to move at all.

You could not crash through the branches.

That must be why the animals that lived in swamps were built the way they were, Nick thought.

He wished he had brought something to read. He felt like reading.

He did not feel like going on into the swamp.

He looked down the river. A big cedar slanted all the way across thestream.

> ==slant英 [slɑ:nt] 美 [slænt] vt.&vi. 使倾斜；歪斜 vt. 有偏向性地陈述，报道 n. 倾向，倾斜；偏见；斜面，斜角==

Beyond that the river went into the swamp.

Nick did not want to go in there now.

He felt a reaction against deep wading with the water deepening upunder his armpits, to hook big trout in places impossible to land them.

In the swamp the banks were bare, the big cedars came together overhead, the sun did not come through, except in patches; in the fast deep water, in the half light, thefishing would be tragic.

In the swamp fishing was a tragic adventure. Nick did not want it.

He did not want to go down the stream any further today.

He took out his knife, opened it and stuck it in the log.

Then he pulled up the sack, reached into it and brought out one of the trout.

Holding him near the tail, hard to hold, alive, in his hand, he whacked him against the log.

> ==whack英 [wæk] 美 [hwæk, wæk] vt.&n. 重击==

The trout quivered, rigid. Nick laid him on the log in the shade and broke the neck of the other fish the same way.

He laid them side by side on the log. They were fine trout.

Nick cleaned them, slitting them from the vent to the tip of the jaw.

All the insides and the gills and tongue came out in one piece.

They were both males; long gray-white strips of milt, smooth andclean.

All the insides clean and compact, coming out all together.

Nick tossed the offal ashore for the minks to find.

He washed the trout in the stream. When he held them back up in the water they looked like live fish.

Their color was not gone yet. He washed his hands and dried them on the log.

Then he laid the trout on the sack spread out on the log, rolled them up in it, tied the bundle and put it inthe landing net.

His knife was still standing, blade stuck in the log.

He cleaned it on the wood and put it in his pocket.

Nick stood up on the log, holding his rod, the landing net hanging heavy, then stepped into the water and splashed ashore.

He climbed the bank and cut up intothe woods, toward the high ground.

He was going back to camp. He looked back. The river just showed through the trees.

There were plenty of days coming when he could fish the swamp.

### 背景知识

**💧****Sandwiches**

**三明治的起源和各国特色**

我们今天的内容中有这样的情节：He laid his rod down, moved along to the shady end of the log and took the sandwiches out of his pocket. He dipped the sandwiches in the cold water. The current carried away the crumbs. He ate the sandwiches... 他搁下钓竿，把身子移到圆木背阴的那一端，从口袋里拿出三明治。他把三明治浸在冷水内。流水把一些面包屑带走了。他吃掉了三明治...... Nick总是带三明治作食物，我们今天来就一起来了解一下三明治的起源和各国特色的三明治吧～



三明治的起源

在“三明治”这个词被发明之前，世上就已经先有了三明治。三明治最早的起源，可以追溯到犹太人Hillel the Elder，据说在公元前1世纪，他就已经在逾越节上，把羊肉和药草包夹在犹太面包里享用。这是有史料记载的最早的、最像三明治的吃法。

三明治这个命名，源自一位十八世纪的英国人John Montague。他是三明治伯爵四世（the Fourth Earl of Sandwich），据传这位伯爵特别喜欢玩牌，玩到了废寝忘食的地步。他的仆人只好把肉、奶酪和蔬菜夹在面包里，让他在玩牌的时候也可以填饱肚子，又不会让碰过食物的手弄脏牌。这位伯爵在玩牌时兴之所至，就把这种食物命名为自己爵位的名称：Sandwich（三明治）。



在18世纪，三明治多被视为夜晚赌钱娱乐时的分享食物，到后来，又上升成为贵族们的宵夜。到了19世纪，工业社会的发展，让三明治在英国和西班牙成为广受工人欢迎的食物，因为它便携、方便、顶饱，非常适合外出工作时食用。20世纪，面包成为美式饮食中的典型代表，搭上这趟顺风车的三明治，开始在全球风靡起来。



如何作出一款美味的三明治呢？



第一步：面包的选择，一般来说，做三明治都是选用切片面包。想要健康一点就选择全麦，正常情况下白面包就可以。第二步：选择调味酱，三明治常用到的酱有：黄油、美乃滋、黄芥末酱、番茄酱、烧烤酱等。第三步：食材搭配，肉、蔬菜、奶酪都不能少，其他食材如鸡蛋、辣椒、牛油果、橄榄等，都可以根据喜好添加。第四步：三明治再烹饪，如果你想吃到口感更酥脆的、热乎乎的三明治，就需要用烤箱和煎锅再进行一次烹饪。



各国特色三明治



\1. 丹麦三明治

丹麦三明治又被称为“没有盖子的三明治”和“开放三明治“，顾名思义，这种三明治是只有两层，一层面包片，一层馅。但是别看丹麦三明治只有一小片面包，它对面包的选择其实有着特殊的要求，就是必须用丹麦的黑面包，它比我们平时吃的切片面包要紧实许多。



\2. 土耳其三明治

由土耳其大厨Mahmut Aygun发明，皮塔饼中间夹着香嫩多汁的薄切烤羊肉、生菜丝、番茄、青瓜、薄荷和酸奶酱，光看这组合就知道必定美味。它的首次亮相其实是在德国，Mahmut Aygun在1971年从土耳其移居到了德国，然后在柏林开了家简餐，那里正是这土耳其风味三文治的诞生地。



\3. 法国三明治

如果你很爱芝士，那么法国人发明的这种三明治你一定不能错过。方包内夹着火腿和芝士，外层还有芝士包裹，在黄油中煎得焦香，超级高卡路里，但绝对可以让芝士狂热粉打呼满足。地道的三明治一般会用Emmental或Gruyère这两种芝士，还可以在奶酪火腿三明治上加一枚水波蛋。

### 课文理解

昨天的内容里，Nick因为接钩线断了而丢了一条即将到手的大鳟鱼，在经历了这场惊心动魄后，Nick重新恢复信心开始钓鱼。这一次，他钓到了一条“好”鳟鱼（Nick had one good trout. He did not care about getting many trout.）紧接着他又钓到了一条大鳟鱼，Nick非常满意便坐下来休息了（He spread the mouth of the sack and looked down in at the two big trout alive in the water.）这里Nick有两个心理活动都很有引申含义，首先是他突然想起来看书这回事，这里象征的是他在精神和思想上的一次重生——

💧**Clue 1**: The thought of reading books indicates a mental rejuvenation.



**Evidence 1**: He wished he had brought something to read. He felt like reading. He did not feel like going on into the swamp.

他想，要是带几本书来就好了。他真想读书。他不想继续往沼泽地走了。



从Nick来到这片地区以后，如果说露营、徒步以及钓鱼等等都是体力和生理上的活动，那么“看书”则是出现的第一项和精神思想有关的活动。所以这里是一个积极暗示，说明Nick已经从对身体的注意转移到了对精神的关照。我们再来看Nick的另一个心理活动：他暂时不愿意再往沼泽地里走——



💧**Clue 2**: Nick intends to delay his fishing in the swamp.



**Evidence 1**: Nick did not want to go in there now. He felt a reaction against deep wading with the water deepening up under his armpits, to hook big trout in places impossible to land them... In the swamp fishing was a tragic adventure. Nick did not want it. He did not want to go down the stream any further today.

尼克不想马上走进沼泽地。水越来越深了，都到了他的腋窝底下，蹚在水里，他感到了不小的阻力，他不想到即使钓了大鳟鱼也没法拿上岸的地方去… 在沼泽地里钓鱼，是一桩可悲的事。尼克不想这样干了。今天他不想再往下游多走一步了。



**Evidence 2**: He was going back to camp. He looked back. The river just showed through the trees. There were plenty of days coming when he could fish the swamp.

他要走回宿营地去。他回头望望，那河流在树林里隐约可见。今后可以到沼泽地钓鱼的日子多着呢。



我们先来看看沼泽地是一片怎样的地方：那里除了岸边荒芜（the banks were bare）以外，深水处还十分湍急（the fast deep water）、半明不暗（the half light），阳光也透不进来。但也是在沼泽地里才栖息着更大的鳟鱼。



对照Nick现在的心境，他已经取得了很大的进步，比如他在痛失一条大鳟鱼后并没有陷入在持久的悲伤和悔恨里，又或者是他开始从和自然的接触中得到治愈和力量。沼泽地对他来说可能意味着更隐蔽的创伤和神秘莫测的阴暗地，而当下是惬意舒适的，所以他愿意再拖延一会。无论如何，他终将踏入那片沼泽地。

**💧****The Book Lists of the Great Writers**

**名家的书单**



我们今天的内容中有Nick钓完鱼后悔自己没带书来读的情节。（He wished he had brought something to read. He felt like reading. He did not feel like going on into the swamp. 他想，但愿自己带了些书报来。他很想读些东西。他不想继续向前走进沼地。）在《海明威谈创作》这本书里，有几篇文章谈到了一个青年想要成为作家应该读什么书。如他所说，想要成为作家，应该什么书都读。我们今天就一起了解一下著名作家给我们提供了什么样的书单吧～



\1. 欧内斯特·海明威（Ernest Hemingway ）



海明威曾经说过，“没有一个朋友像书一样忠诚”。1935年，他在《Esquire》杂志上列出了自己的一些“朋友”，表示“宁愿再读一次……也不愿年收入一百万美元。”



这些书包括：《安娜·卡列尼娜》（*Anna Karenina*）、《远方与往昔》（*Far Away and Long Ago*）、《呼啸山庄》（*Wuthering Heights*）、《包法利夫人》（*Madame Bovary*）、《战争与和平》（*War and Peace*）、《猎人笔记》（*A Sportsman's Sketches*）、《卡拉马佐夫兄弟》（*Brothers Karamazov*）、《都柏林人》（*Dubliners*）、叶芝的《自传》（*Autobiographies*）等等。



\2. 弗拉基米尔·纳博科夫（Vladimir Nabokov）

《洛丽塔》（Lolita）的作者纳博科夫在索引卡片上写作，“逐步誊抄，扩充，重新组织直至成书”。《巴黎评论》杂志写道，他在20世纪50年代接受法国电视台采访时分享了他认为可以称为“伟大文学作品”的书单：詹姆斯·乔伊斯的《尤利西斯》（*Ulysses*），卡夫卡的《变形记》（*The Metamorphosis*），安德烈·别雷的《彼得堡》（*Petersburg*），还有普鲁斯特《追忆似水年华》（*In Search of Lost Time*）的前半部分。



\3. 弗朗西斯·菲茨杰拉德（Francis Fitzgerald）

1936年，菲茨杰拉德离世前四年，那时他住在北卡罗来纳州的格罗夫公园酒店。 在他企图开枪自杀后，酒店坚持让护士多萝西·理查逊监护他。期间，菲茨杰拉德给了这位护士一张22本书的书单，都是他认为的“必读书目”。

其中包括西奥多·德莱塞的《嘉莉妹妹》（*Sister Carrie*），欧内斯特·勒南的《耶稣的一生》（*The Life of Jesus*），亨利克·易卜生的《玩偶之家》，以及舍伍德·安德森的《小城畸人》（*Winesburg, Ohio*）。



\4.  马克·吐温（Mark Twain）



1887年，马克·吐温给缅因州牧师查尔斯·D.克瑞回了一封信。马克·吐温回复道，他最喜爱的书包括：卡莱尔的《法国大革命》（*The French Revolution*），托马斯·马洛里爵士的《亚瑟王之死》（*The Death of King Arthur*），《天方夜谭》（*Arabian Nights*）等等。 他还提到了《B.B.》，并表示这本书是“我在几年前写的，不是为了出版，只是为了自己读”。



\5. 简·奥斯汀（Jane Austen）



经典小说《傲慢与偏见》（*Pride and Prejudice*）和《爱玛》（*Emma*）的作者简·奥斯汀本人就是书、诗歌和戏剧的忠实读者。她的阅读书目包括拜伦的《海盗》（*The Corsair*），让利斯夫人的《奥林匹与泰奥菲尔》（*Olimpe and Theophile*），以及安·拉德克利夫的《尤多尔佛之谜》（*The Mysteries of Udolpho*）。 不过，她最喜欢的是塞缪尔·理查森的《查尔斯·格兰迪森爵士》（*Sir Charles Grandison*）。



\6.  塞缪尔·贝克特（Samuel Beckett）



《等待戈多》（*Waiting for Godot*）的作者贝克特一直是个注重个人隐私的人，甚至在写作方面获得赞誉后也是如此。2011年，作者从1941年至1956年的许多信件出版了，让全世界看到了他的交友和阅读习惯。



贝克特在信中提到了许多书：他评价儒勒·凡尔纳的《环游世界八十天》（*Around the World in 80 Days by Jules Verne*）充满活力；他还写道，第四次阅读台奥多·冯塔纳的《血泪的控诉》（*Effi Briest*）时，他依旧在同样的地方流下了泪水；并且在很长一段时间里，他最喜欢的书是杰罗姆·大卫·塞林格的《麦田里的守望者》（*The Catcher in the Rye*）。
