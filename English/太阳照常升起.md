Robert Cohn was once middleweight boxing champion of Princeton.

Do not think that I am very much impressed by that as a boxing title, but it meant a lot to Cohn.

He cared nothing for boxing, in fact he disliked it, but he learned it painfully and thoroughly to counteract the feeling of inferiority and shyness he had felt on being treated as a Jew at Princeton.

There was a certain inner comfort in knowing he could knock down anybody who was snooty to him, although, being very shy and a thoroughly nice boy, he never fought except in the gym.

He was Spider Kelly's star pupil.

> Spider Kelly的原名是Tommy "Spider" Kelly (1867.9.6 – 1927.1.4），来自纽约的黑人区（Harlem, New York）, 因此大家也会把他称作“The Harlem Spider”. 在1890到1892之间，他都是最轻量级拳击手中的世界冠军（the world champion bantamweight fighter）.

Spider Kelly taught all his young gentlemen to box like featherweights, no matter whether they weighed one hundred and five or two hundred and five pounds.

> 拳击比赛分为8个体重级别，Spider Kelly属于的是Bantamweight（“最轻量级”），bantam这个词原本指“矮脚鸡”，体重在112到118磅之间（约51到54公斤）的拳击手属于这个级别；而Featherweight则是“羽量级”，这一级别的拳击手体重在118到126磅（约54到57公斤）之间。Cohnn本身是属于Middleweight “中量级”的（Robert Cohn was once middleweight boxing champion of Princeton），体重约在73公斤以下。

But it seemed to fit Cohn. He was really very fast.

He was so good that Spider promptly overmatched him and got his nose permanently flattened.

> ==permanently英 ['pɜ:mənəntlɪ] 美 [ˈpəmənəntlɪ] adv. 永久地，长期不变地==
>
> <font color=red>He was so good that Spider promptly overmatched him and got his nose permanently flattened.</font>

> 他学得很好，斯拜德马上安排他跟强手交锋，给他终生留下了一个扁平的鼻子。
>
> **💧表达精讲**

> ①overmatch的本义是指“比……强”，比如be a match for表示“旗鼓相当”，而overmatch就是to be more than a match for.
>
> *但是这里的overmatch并不是指Spider比Cohn厉害然后把他的鼻子打扁了；在体育术语里，overmatch指“为……安排强手”（to match with a superior opponent）. 所以这里是Spider看到Cohn学得很优秀，所以马上让他跟高手过招。
>
> ②flatten从“使变平”这个意思还可以引申为“夷为平地，炸平”，相当于level. 比如：Hundreds of homes were flattened/levelled by the tornado. 数百户住宅被龙卷风夷为平地。

This increased Cohn's distaste for boxing, but it gave him a certain satisfaction of some strange sort, and it certainly improved his nose.

> <font color=red>This increased Cohn's distaste for boxing, but it gave him a certain satisfaction of some strange sort, and it certainly improved his nose.</font>

>
> **💧知识拓展**
>
> 为什么把鼻子打扁了些反而还好看了呢？这其实源于对犹太人面部特征的刻板印象。在13世纪中叶的欧洲，犹太人的鹰钩鼻（hooked noses）往往在画作里被过度渲染成充满敌意的样子（singled out as a hostile caricature），以致于后来一提到犹太人，大家就觉得他们都是鼻梁突起高耸、然后鼻头向下弯。Cohn在大学的时候遭受嘲笑也多半是因为这个，现在鼻子扁了一点，他反而感到庆幸。

In his last year at Princeton he read too much and took to wearing spectacles. I never met any one of his class who remembered him.

They did not even remember that he was middleweight boxing champion.

I mistrust all frank and simple people, especially when their stories hold together, and I always had a suspicion that perhaps Robert Cohn had never been middleweight boxing champion,

> <font color=red>I mistrust all frank and simple people, especially when their stories hold together...</font>

and that perhaps a horse had stepped on his face, or that maybe his mother had been frightened or seen something, or that he had, maybe, bumped into something as a young child,

but I finally had somebody verify the story from Spider Kelly.

> ==verify英 [ˈverɪfaɪ] 美 [ˈvɛrəˌfaɪ] vt. 核实；证明；判定==

Spider Kelly not only remembered Cohn. He had often wondered what had become of him.

Robert Cohn was a member, through his father, of one of the richest Jewish families in New York,and through his mother of one of the oldest.

At the military school where he prepped for Princeton, and played a very good end on the football team, no one had made him race-conscious.

> ==prep vt. 使(某人)做好进行手术〔考试〕的准备==
>
> ==race-conscious 种族意识的==

No one had ever made him feel he was a Jew, and hence any different from anybody else, until he went to Princeton.

He was a nice boy, a friendly boy, and very shy, and it made him bitter.

He took it out in boxing, and he came out of Princeton with painful self-consciousness and the flattened nose, and was married by the first girl who was nice to him.

He was married five years, had three children, lost most of the fifty thousand dollars his father left him, the balance of the estate having gone to his mother, hardened into a rather unattractive mould under domestic unhappiness with a rich wife;

> <font color=red>He was married five years, / had three children, / lost most of the fifty thousand dollars his father left him, / the balance of the estate having gone to his mother, / hardened into a rather unattractive mould under domestic unhappiness with a rich wife...</font>

> 他结婚五年，生了三个孩子，父亲留给他的五万美元几乎挥霍殆尽（遗产的其余部分归他母亲所有），由于和有钱的妻子过着不幸的家庭生活，他变得冷漠无情、使人讨厌……
>
> **💧句式拆解**
>
> ①首先来看这个句子主体部分的谓语有哪些：He was married..., had..., lost..., hardened into...（注意这里没有按照通常的语法规则用and作连接）；
>
> ②the balance of the estate having gone to his mother 属于独立主格结构（在盖茨比当中出现过不只一次哦~）整个句子本身的主语是he（Cohn），这里出现了the balance of the estate作主语，后面则是having gone的现在分词短语作伴随状语；因为主语不同，所以整个结构都是可以独立在句子之外来看的；
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①the balance of the estate “遗产的其余部分”；estate常见指“庄园，住宅”，但在这里是“个人全部财产（尤指遗产）”；balance表示“剩余（部分）”，也就是the rest. 比如：The firm owns about 96% of the portfolio, with the balance belonging to our family. （资产组合中，公司拥有96%左右的股份，剩余部分为我们家族所有。）
>
> *再补充一个知识点，balance从“剩余”这个含义还延伸出了很多日常惯用表达，比如表示“银行账户余额”：My bank balance isn’t good.（我的银行账户里余额不多了。）
>
> 还可以用来指“假期余额”: The balance of my annual leave still has 5 days.（我剩下的年假还有5天。）
>
> ②harden into 指“变得冷酷无情”（to become less sympathetic and gentle）, 比如：Her years of drunken bickering hardened my heart.（她常年醉酒吵闹让我的心麻木了。）
>
> ③a rather unattractive mould “讨人厌的类型”；mould本义是“模具”，在这里指“人的气质类型”（type of person）. 比如：a hero in the ‘Superman’ mould（“超人”型的英雄）

and just when he had made up his mind to leave his wife she left him and went off with a miniature-painter.

> ==miniature英 [ˈmɪnətʃə(r)] 美 [ˈmɪniəˌtʃʊr, -tʃɚ, ˈmɪnə-] adj. 小型的，微小的 n. 微型复制品；微小模型；微型画；微型人像画==

As he had been thinking for months about leaving his wife and had not done it because it would be too cruel to deprive her of himself, her departure was a very healthful shock.

The divorce was arranged and Robert Cohn went out to the Coast.

In California he fell among literary people and, as he still had a little of the fifty thousand left, in a short time he was backing a review of the Arts.

The review commenced publication in Carmel, California, and finished in Province town, Massachusetts.

By that time Cohn, who had been regarded purely as an angel, and whose name had appeared on the editorial page merely as a member of the advisory board, had become the sole editor.

It was his money and he discovered he liked the authority of editing. He was sorry when the magazine became too expensive and he had to give it up.

By that time, though, he had other things to worry about. He had been taken in hand by a lady who hoped to rise with the magazine.

> <font color=red>He had been taken in hand by a lady who hoped to rise with the magazine.</font>
>
> 他已经被一位指望跟这家杂志一起飞黄腾达的女士捏在手心里了。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> had been taken in hand “被捏在手心里”，take sb in hand也就是“掌控、支配某人”，hand在这里相当于control. 比如a manager with a firm hand表示“一位手段强硬（管理严格）的经理”。

She was very forceful, and Cohn never had a chance of not being taken in hand. Also he was sure that he loved her.

When this lady saw that the magazine was not going to rise, she became a little disgusted with Cohn and decided that she might as well get what there was to get while there was still something available, so she urged that they go to Europe, where Cohn could write.

They came to Europe, where the lady had been educated, and stayed three years. During these three years, the first spent in travel, the last two in Paris, Robert Cohn had two friends, Braddocks and myself. Braddocks was his literary friend. I was his tennis friend.

The lady who had him, her name was Frances, found toward the end of the second year that her looks were going, and her attitude toward Robert changed from one of careless possession and exploitation to the absolute determination that he should marry her.

> ==exploitation英 [ˌeksplɔɪˈteɪʃn] 美 [ˌɛksplɔɪˈteʃən] n. 开发；剥削；利用==
>
> n. 开发；剥削；利用
>
> ...and her attitude toward Robert changed from one of careless possession and exploitation to the absolute determination that he should marry her.
>
> 一反过去漫不经心地掌握并利用科恩的常态，断然决定他必须娶她。
>
> 💧exploitation可以指贬义上的“剥削，利用”，也可以指中性意义上的“开发，开采”，比如：the controlled exploitation of resources（有节制的资源开发）

During this time Robert's mother had settled an allowance on him, about three hundred dollars a month. During two years and a half I do not believe that Robert Cohn looked at another woman.

He was fairly happy, except that, like many people living in Europe, he would rather have been in America, and he had discovered writing.

He wrote a novel, and it was not really such a bad novel as the critics later called it, although it was a very poor novel. He read many books, played bridge, played tennis, and boxed at a local gymnasium.

> ==gymnasium英 [dʒɪmˈneɪziəm] 美 [dʒɪmˈneziəm] n. 健身房，体育馆==

I first became aware of his lady's attitude toward him one night after the three of us had dined together. We had dined at l'Avenue's and afterward went to the café? de Versailles for coffee.

We had several fines ([法]白兰地) after the coffee, and I said I must be going. Cohn had been talking about the two of us going off somewhere on a weekend trip.

He wanted to get out of town and get in a good walk.

I suggested we fly to Strasbourg and walk up to Saint Odile, or somewhere or other in Alsace.

"I know a girl in Strasbourg who can show us the town," I said.

Somebody kicked me under the table.

I thought it was accidental and went on: "She's been there two years and knows everything there is to know about the town. She's a swell girl."

> ==swell adj. 漂亮的；一流的==

I was kicked again under the table and, looking, saw Frances, Robert's lady, her chin lifting and her face hardening.

"Hell," I said, "why go to Strasbourg? We could go up to Bruges, or to the Ardennes."

Cohn looked relieved. I was not kicked again. I said good-night and went out.

Cohn said he wanted to buy a paper and would walk to the corner with me.

"For God's sake," he said, "why did you say that about that girl in Strasbourg for? Didn't you see Frances?"

"No, why should I? If I know an American girl that lives in Strasbourg what the hell is it to Frances?"

"It doesn't make any difference. Any girl. I couldn't go, that would be all." "Don't be silly."

"You don't know Frances. Any girl at all. Didn't you see the way she looked?"

"Oh, well," I said, "let's go to Senlis." "Don't get sore."

"I'm not sore. Senlis is a good place and we can stay at the Grand Cerf and take a hike in the woods and come home."

"Good, that will be fine." "Well, I'll see you tomorrow at the courts," I said.

"Good-night, Jake," he said, and started back to the café? "You forgot to get your paper," I said.

"That's so." He walked with me up to the kiosque at the corner. "You are not sore, are you, Jake?" He turned with the paper in his hand.

"No, why should I be?" "See you at tennis," he said. I watched him walk back to the café? holding his paper.I rather liked him and evidently she led him quite a life.

> <font color=red>I rather liked him and evidently she led him quite a life.</font>
>
> 我挺喜欢他，可弗朗西丝显然弄得他的日子很不好过。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> quite a life 在这里有讽刺、调侃的意味，暗指quite a bad/terrible life；通常quite用于强调后面的名词有不寻常的地方（一般是正面的），比如：That was quite a party you had.（你的聚会搞得非常不错。）但这里结合语境应是在说反话。

### 背景知识

**💧1. About the author**

欧内斯特·米勒·海明威（Ernest Miller Hemingway，1899年7月21日－1961年7月2日），出生于美国伊利诺伊州芝加哥市郊区奥克帕克，美国作家、记者，被认为是20世纪最著名的小说家之一。

孩童时代的海明威喜欢读图画书和动物漫画，听各类型的故事。还承袭了父亲的兴趣，如打猎、钓鱼、在森林和湖泊中露营等。自高中起，海明威在写作上的天赋就已经崭露头角，因此18岁高中毕业时，又因为不愿意读大学，所以他便直接到了报社当记者开始写作生涯。

1918年，第一次世界大战爆发后，海明威不顾父亲的反对，辞掉了记者一职，并尝试加入美国军队以观察第一次世界大战的战斗情况。但是由于视力缺陷导致体检不及格，他最后被调到红十字会担任救护车司机。这段经历让海明威目睹了战争的残酷，他早期的小说《永别了，武器》（*Farewell to Arms*）的创作灵感便来源于此。

（1918年的海明威）

1921年，海明威娶了他的第一任妻子——哈德莉·理察逊（Hadley Richardson），并在9月迁到了芝加哥北部的三层公寓居住。到12月，海明威一家迁出国外。在巴黎居住的期间，海明威创作了《在我们的时代里》、《太阳照常升起》等作品。

（1926年一家三口）

离婚后，他迎娶了第二任妻子——宝琳·费孚（Pauline Pfeiffer），举家回到美国，过上了宁静的田园生活。

（1931到1939年间海明威在佛罗里达的居所）

1937年至1938年，他以战地记者的身份奔波于西班牙内战（Spanish Civil War）前线，创作了以美国人参加西班牙人民反法西斯战争为题材的长篇小说《丧钟为谁而鸣》（1940）。在第二次世界大战期间，他也作为记者随军行动，并参加了解放巴黎的战斗。

战后海明威客居古巴，潜心写作。1952年，《老人与海》问世，深受好评，翌年获普利策奖（Pulitzer Prize）. 1954年获贝尔文学奖。卡斯特罗掌权后，他离开古巴返美定居。因身上多处旧伤，百病缠身，精神忧郁，1961年7月2日用猎枪自杀。

**💧2. About the book**

《太阳照常升起》是海明威创作的第一部长篇小说，书名来自于扉页摘抄的《圣经》“传道书”中的经文：

One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.

The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.

一代过去、一代又来，地却永远长存。

日头出来、日头落下、急归所出之地。



The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.

风往南刮、又向北转、不住的旋转、而且返回转行原道。



All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.

江河都往海里流、海却不满．江河从何处流、仍归还何处。



小说本身以1924年至1925年这一历史时段和名城巴黎为背景，故事的主人公都在感情上遭受过创伤，或者因为战争而落下心理或生理机能障碍。作者描绘了他们在失落和绝望中放浪形骸，向醉生梦死、浮躁喧闹的生活方式寻求刺激和慰藉的精神状态，同时也展现了他们在一边愤世嫉俗一边寻求出路的努力。

故事的主要情节是美国青年巴恩斯（Jake Barnes）在第一次世界大战中脊椎受伤，失去性能力，战后在巴黎任记者时与英国人阿施利夫人（Lady Brett Ashley）相爱，夫人一味追求享乐，而他只能借酒浇愁。两人和一帮男女朋友去西班牙潘普洛纳（Pamplona）参加斗牛节，追求精神刺激。夫人拒绝了犹太青年科恩（Robert Cohn）的苦苦追求，却迷上了年仅十九岁的斗牛士罗梅罗（Romero）. 然而，在相处了一段日子以后，由于双方年龄实在悬殊，而阿施利夫人又不忍心毁掉纯洁青年的前程，这段恋情黯然告终。夫人最终回到了巴恩斯身边，尽管双方都清楚，彼此永远也不能真正地结合在一起。

借这本书，海明威成为了名副其实“迷惘的一代”的代言人，并以此书开创了海明威式的独特文风。关于“迷惘的一代”（The Lost Generation），这个称呼首先是美国文学评论家格特鲁德·斯坦因（Gertrude Stein）提出的对于第一次世界大战到第二次世界大战期间出现的美国一类作家的总称。《太阳照常升起》扉页上的题词就是她写的："You are all a lost generation"（你们都是迷惘的一代。）

“迷惘的一代”共同表现出的是对美国社会发展的一种失望和不满。他们之所以迷惘，是因为这一代人的传统价值观念完全不再适合战后的世界，可是他们又找不到新的生活准则。他们认为，只有现实才是真理，可现实是残酷的。于是他们只能按照自己的本能和感官行事，竭力反叛以前的理想和价值观，用叛逆思想和行为来表达他们对现实的不满。

但《太阳照常升起》不仅是“迷惘的一代”的代言作，对于今天身处迷惘以及有前卫和逆反青年、渴望独创艺术以及更加开放的心灵空间的读者来说，这本书也会让他们找到共鸣。

### 课文理解

和《了不起的盖茨比》相同，《太阳照常升起》也是以第一人称的口吻来写的，叙述者是Jake Barnes. 在一开篇，Jake没有交代自己的背景，而是先介绍了另一位主人公Robert Cohn. 根据Jake的描述，他们是Cohn再婚后搬到欧洲才认识的。Jake也是Cohn在法国唯二的朋友之一，俩人是网球的球友（During these three years, the first spent in travel, the last two in Paris, Robert Cohn had two friends, Braddocks and myself. Braddocks was his literary friend. I was his tennis friend）.

Cohn是一个非常有意思的人物，他的身上有很多矛盾点，比如他因为犹太人的身份在大学时期受到种族歧视而很怨愤，当通过学习拳击可以把那些目空一切的人击倒的时候，他的心里才稍微获得了一点平衡感，但他也只敢在拳击场上这么做（being very shy and a thoroughly nice boy, he never fought except in the gym）. 这种自卑感也影响到了他后来的择偶和婚姻——

💧**Clue 1**:   Cohn has been feeling inferior as being Jewish.



**Evidence 1**: He took it out in boxing, and he came out of Princeton with painful self-consciousness and the flattened nose, and was married by the first girl who was nice to him.

他在拳击中发泄这种情绪，他带着痛苦的自我意识和扁平的鼻子离开普林斯顿大学，碰到第一个待他好的姑娘就结了婚。

这个“待他好”的姑娘是否真的如此呢？下文提到了他的婚姻生活并不幸福：(he) hardened into a rather unattractive mould under domestic unhappiness with a rich wife. 这里面有两个细节，首先是他开始变得“冷酷无情，使人讨厌”，其次他们的婚姻不幸还跟他的妻子有钱有关。

需要补充的是，Cohn并不是一个穷小子出身，他的父母都来自非富即贵的显赫家族（through his father, of one of the richest Jewish families in New York, and through his mother of one of the oldest）, 只是他在父亲过世后挥霍无度，最后才变得没剩下几个钱。可以猜想他可能是因为失去家里的财政地位而处处受压制，或者是这个姑娘当初“对他好”只是觊觎他的家庭背景。俩人最后拆伙也非常戏剧化：



**Evidence 2**: As he had been thinking for months about leaving his wife and had not done it because it would be too cruel to deprive her of himself, her departure was a very healthful shock.

他已有好几个月尽考虑着要离开他的妻子，因为觉得使她失去他未免太残酷，所以没有那么做，因此她的出走对他倒是一次很有利的冲击。

Cohn把妻子的离家出走形容为一次“很有利的冲击”（a very healthful shock）, 因为在他看来，自己避免了主动对妻子造成伤害，所以虽然这件事给他带来了一定的影响，他反而觉得是很有益身心的。

在五年的婚姻告终后，他开始利用自己仅剩的积蓄投身到文艺界里。就在他资助一家文艺评论杂志的时候，他又被另一个想从他身上捞好处的女人（Frances）缠住了，后来她还半说服半强制地让Cohn把自己娶回家。但这个女人对他似乎也只有专横和占有欲，为了说明这个，Jake讲了一次三人一起吃饭的经历——



💧**Clue 2**: Frances is in control of Cohn's life.



**Evidence 1**: I suggested we fly to Strasbourg and walk up to Saint Odile, or somewhere or other in Alsace. "I know a girl in Strasbourg who can show us the town," I said. Somebody kicked me under the table.

我建议坐飞机到斯特拉斯堡，从那里步行到圣奥戴尔或者阿尔萨斯地区的什么别的地方。“我在斯特拉斯堡有个熟识的姑娘，她可以带我们观光这座城市，”我说。有人在桌子底下踢了我一脚。



**Evidence 2**: I was kicked again under the table and, looking, saw Frances, Robert's lady, her chin lifting and her face hardening.

在桌子下面我又挨了一脚，我一看，只见弗朗西丝，就是罗伯特的情人，撅着下巴 ，板着面孔呢。

当Jake提到可以让自己认识的一个姑娘作为地陪的时候，Cohn明显非常难紧张，所以连踢了Jake两脚。事后他还向Jake解释说，他无论如何也不能去的。（"It doesn't make any difference. Any girl. I couldn't go, that would be all."）而且不论是怎么样的女孩，都会引起Frances的不悦。（"You don't know Frances. Any girl at all. Didn't you see the way she looked?"）

Cohn是完全在Frances的掌控之中的（had been taken in hand），在他们结婚之前就是如此了，否则Frances也没有办法以自己“姿色日渐衰退”（her looks were going）为借口把自己嫁给Cohn. 所以在Jake看来，Cohn在Frances手里的日子真的很不好过。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧Iceberg Theory 冰山理论**

大多数人第一次读海明威的时候都会觉得故事太过寡淡无味、缺乏引人入胜的悬念，情节似乎也只是人物对话的堆砌。如果你也有这种感觉，那么说明你可能忽略了海明威其实采取了一种很特殊的写作策略，也就是依据所谓的“冰山理论”。

冰山理论（Iceberg Theory）指的是人的语言对于人的思想的表达就好像冰山一样，只有八分之一在水上面，有八分之七在水下；意思是说人的语言是不足以表达思想的，对于作者而言，也没有必要写得太过于直露，因为读者是能读懂的。它还有另一个名称，“省略理论”（Theory of Omission）, 这就已经足够说明了这个理论的目的就在于达成一种“简约艺术”。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/8730e9b8d891b0c896c99da811720df4-sz_74111.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)

但这种省略并不是简单的减少字数，或是刻意删减情节，它是有一定的原则的。海明威在自己的一篇文学评论“The Art of Short Story”里写道：

"A few things I have found to be true. If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened. If you leave or skip something because you do not know it, thestory will be worthless. The test of any story is how very good the stuff that you, not your editors, omit."

“我发现了几件事实：如果作者在作品里省略的是自己已知的信息，那么故事会有一种凝练感。但如果作者只是因为自己无从知晓而省略或跳过，那么故事最终就失去了价值。所以一个故事的好与坏，不在于出版社编辑删掉的那部分有多好，而是作者自己删掉的内容。”

所以关键在于作者要对自己想写的东西心里很有数，这样对于读者来说，只要作家写得真实，会强烈的感觉到他所省略的地方，好像作者已经把他们写出来了似的。

总而言之，“冰山理论”就是用简洁的文字塑造出鲜明的形象，把自身的感受和思想情绪最大限度的埋藏在形象之中，使之情感充沛却含而不露、思想深沉而隐而不晦，而将文学的可感性与可思性巧妙的结合起来，让读者对鲜明形象的感受去发掘作品的思想意义。

That winter Robert Cohn went over to America with his novel, and it was accepted by a fairly good publisher.

For four years his horizon had been absolutely limited to his wife. For three years, or almost three years, he had never seen beyond Frances.I am sure he had never been in love in his life.

He had married on the rebound from the rotten time he had in college, and Frances took him on the rebound from his discovery that he had not been everything to his first wife.

Also, playing for higher stakes than he could afford in some rather steep bridge games with his New York connections, he had held cards and won several hundred dollars.

It was all that was needed to set him off.

I did not realize the extent to which it had set him off until one day he came into my office.

"Hello, Robert," I said. "Did you come in to cheer me up?"

"Would you like to go to South America, Jake?" he asked.

"No.""Why not?""I don't know. I never wanted to go. Too expensive. You can see all the South Americans you want in Paris anyway."

"They're not the real South Americans."

"They look awfully real to me."

I had a boat train to catch with a week's mail stories, and only half of them written.

"No; listen, Jake. If I handled both our expenses, would you go to South America with me?"

"Why me?" "You can talk Spanish. And it would be more fun with two of us."

"No," I said, "I like this town and I go to Spain in the summertime."

"All my life I've wanted to go on a trip like that," Cohn said. He sat down. "I'll be too old before I can ever do it."

"Don't be a fool," I said. "You can go anywhere you want. You've got plenty of money."

"I know. But I can't get started."

"Cheer up," I said. "All countries look just like the moving pictures."

But I felt sorry for him. He had it badly.

"I can't stand it to think my life is going so fast and I'm not really living it."

"Nobody ever lives their life all the way up except bullfighters."

"I'm not interested in bull-fighters. That's an abnormal life. I want to go back in the country in South America. We could have a great trip."

"Did you ever think about going to British East Africa to shoot?" "No, I wouldn't like that." "I'd go there with you." "No; that doesn't interest me."

"That's because you never read a book about it. Go on and read a book all full of love affairs with the beautiful shiny black princesses."

"I want to go to South America." He had a hard, Jewish, stubborn streak.

"Come on down-stairs and have a drink." "Aren't you working?" "No," I said.

We went down the stairs to the café on the ground floor. I had discovered that was the best way to get rid of friends.

Once you had a drink all you had to say was: "Well, I've got to get back and get off some cables," and it was done.

It is very important to discover graceful exits like that in the newspaper business, where it is such an important part of the ethics that you should never seem to be working.

Anyway, we went down-stairs to the bar and had a whiskey and soda.

Cohn looked at the bottles in bins around the wall. "This is a good place," he said. "There's a lot of liquor," I agreed.

"Listen, Jake," he leaned forward on the bar.

"Don't you ever get the feeling that all your life is going by and you're not taking advantage of it? Do you realize you've lived nearly half the time you have to live already?"

"Yes, every once in a while."

"Do you know that in about thirty-five years more we'll be dead?"

"What the hell, Robert," I said. "What the hell."

"I'm serious." "It's one thing I don't worry about," I said. "You ought to." "I've had plenty to worry about one time or other. I'm through worrying."

"Well, I want to go to South America."

"Listen, Robert, going to another country doesn't make any difference. I've tried all that. You can't get away from yourself by moving from one place to another. There's nothing to that."

"But you've never been to South America."

"South America hell! If you went there the way you feel now it would be exactly the same. This is a good town. Why don't you start living your life in Paris?"

"I'm sick of Paris, and I'm sick of the Quarter."

"Stay away from the Quarter. Cruise around by yourself and see what happens to you."

"Nothing happens to me. I walked alone all one night and nothing happened except a bicycle cop stopped me and asked to see my papers."

"Wasn't the town nice at night?" "I don't care for Paris." So there you were.

I was sorry for him, but it was not a thing you could do anything about, because right away you ran up against the two stubbornnesses: South America could fix it and he did not like Paris.

He got the first idea out of a book, and I suppose the second came out of a book too.

"Well," I said, "I've got to go up-stairs and get off some cables."

"Do you really have to go?" "Yes, I've got to get these cables off."

"Do you mind if I come up and sit around the office?" "No, come on up."

He sat in the outer room and read the papers, and the Editor and Publisher and I worked hard for two hours.

Then I sorted out the carbons, stamped on a by-line, put the stuff in a couple of big manila envelopes and rang for a boy to take them to the Gare St. Lazare.

I went out into the other room and there was Robert Cohn asleep in the big chair.

He was asleep with his head on his arms. I did not like to wake him up, but I wanted to lock the office and shove off.

I put my hand on his shoulder. He shook his head. "I can't do it," he said, and put his head deeper into his arms. "I can't do it. Nothing will make me do it."

"Robert," I said, and shook him by the shoulder. He looked up. He smiled and blinked.

"Did I talk out loud just then?" "Something. But it wasn't clear." "God, what a rotten dream!" "Did the typewriter put you to sleep?"

"Guess so. I didn't sleep all last night." "What was the matter?" "Talking," he said.

I could picture it. I have a rotten habit of picturing the bedroom scenes of my friends.

We went out to the Café Napolitain to have an aperitif and watch the evening crowd on the Boulevard.

### 背景知识

**💧The Latin Quarter of Paris**

Cohn向Jake表示了自己迫切渴望离开巴黎，离开拉丁区，他对这个地方已经厌恶至极（"I'm sick of Paris, and I'm sick of the Quarter"）, 这就介绍到这本小说的主要情节发生地之一——巴黎拉丁区啦~

拉丁区处于巴黎五区和六区之间，以巴黎索邦大学（Université Paris-Sorbonne）为中心，从圣日耳曼德佩区（Saint-Germain-des-Prés）到卢森堡公园（Jardin du Luxembourg）. 拉丁区这个名字来源于中世纪这里以拉丁语做为教学语言。周围矗立着众多巴黎的高等学府（higher education establishments），所以也是巴黎最有文化和历史气息的地方。

（索邦大学）

而以拉丁区为核心的这片区域也被称为“左岸”（the Left Bank, 法语名是La Rive Gauche）, 也就是塞纳河的南边（south of the River Seine），北边则是“右岸”。这里要补充一点关于塞纳河的地理知识：塞纳河由东向西流经巴黎，在市中心走了一条抛物线——从东南流入，穿过圣路易岛、西堤岛，越过卢浮宫，到亚历山大三世大桥处达到顶点；然后转头向下，擦过埃菲尔铁塔，向西南方向奔出巴黎。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/49518272b225508375a4ab5ffeca0e79-sz_896756.gif)



右岸汇集的主要是高级百货商店、精品店及饭店，还有我们熟知的香榭丽舍大道、协和广场、凯旋门、卢浮宫等。而文化知识界则聚集在左岸，于是各种书店、出版社、小剧场、美术馆、博物馆等逐渐建立了起来。围绕这种社交氛围的咖啡馆、啤酒馆也应运而生，成了左岸知识文化人士重要的聚会场所。从紧靠赛纳河左岸的圣米歇尔大街开始，文化名人和先贤们光顾和聚会过的咖啡馆、酒吧遍布各个街区。



### 课文理解

Cohn是深受自卑之害的一个人，比如他的两段婚姻其实都不是他完全按照自己心意选择的。但有一次，尽管和Frances大吵了一架（His going made an awful row）, 他还是带着自己写的小说到了纽约。结果没想到一个相当不错的出版商收下了他的书（it was accepted by a fairly good publisher），并且他在纽约也受到了很多女人的欢迎，这让他非常飘飘然（it rather went to his head）. 

以及他又看了一本内容十分浪漫且天马行空的小说，这也更加激发了他蠢蠢欲动的心（It was all that need to set him off）. 他开始对生活和爱情充满了不切实际的期待——



💧**Clue 1**:  Cohn holds unrealistic expectations about life and love.



**Evidence 1**: He was not in love yet but he realized that he was an attractive quantity to women, and that the fact of a woman caring for him and wanting to live with him was not simply a divine miracle.

他至今没有真正恋爱过，但是意识到自己对女人来说是一个有魅力的人，有个女人喜欢他并愿意和他生活在一起，这不仅仅是一个神迹而已。



从纽约回来后，Cohn的视野不再局限于他的前妻和Frances，比如前四年里他的眼中只有前妻，而后三年里他除了Frances谁也看不见（For four years his horizon had been absolutely limited to his wife. For three years, or almost three years, he had never seen beyond Frances）. 但当他发现原来自己很招女人喜欢的时候，自信心马上爆棚，这也让他不再对Frances形成依赖，或者受她的控制。



**Evidence 2**: It made him rather vain of his bridge game, and he talked several times of how a man could always make a living at bridge if he were ever forced to.

这使他很为自己的牌技洋洋自得，他几次谈起，一个人迫不得已的话，总是可以靠打桥牌为生的。

Cohn这种盲目的乐观还反映在了生活上。比如只是有几次他下的赌注比较大（playing for higher stakes than he could afford）, 还拿到了几张好牌，所以赢了几百块美元，他就觉得自己是桥牌高手并且能以此为生了。

恰巧他又读了一本充满异域奇想的小说，虽然对于里面的内容不是全盘接受（he made some reservations）, 但他已经大致相信里面所讲的都是言之有理的了（but on the whole the book to him was sound）. 所以有一天他就来到Jake的办公室，想邀请他一起到南美去。在两个人的对话中，Jake的很多话都意味深长，充满了神秘感——



💧**Clue 2**: Mysteries are built about Jake.



**Evidence 1**: "I can't stand it to think my life is going so fast and I'm not really living it."

"Nobody ever lives their life all the way up except bullfighters."

“一想到我的生命消逝得这么迅速，而我并不是在真正地活着，我就受不了。”

“除了斗牛士，没有一个人的人生是一路高歌猛进的。”



Jake对人生似乎没有抱有太过激情、浪漫的期待，所以对他来说，即便三十五年之后自己就会死去（"Do you know that in about thirty-five years more we'll be dead?"）他也丝毫无所谓（"It's one thing I don't worry about," I said.）而且他在这里莫名提到了斗牛士，也让Cohn很费解（"I'm not interested in bull-fighters. That's an abnormal life."）



**Evidence 2**: "Listen, Robert, going to another country doesn't make any difference. I've tried all that. You can't get away from yourself by moving from one place to another. There's nothing to that."

“听我说，罗伯特，到别的国家去也是这么样。我都试过。从一个地方挪到另一个地方，你做不到自我解脱。毫无用处。”



这段话里面有一个关键：“I've tried all that.” 读到这里，好奇心一下就被激发：什么样的人生经历让他对这种乐观心态抱有如此大的幻灭感呢？而且在Jake看来，如果心态还是一样，那么即便到了南美也不会有所好转，所以Cohn应该从在巴黎的生活开始重整旗鼓（"If you went there the way you feel now it would be exactly the same. This is a good town. Why don't you start living your life in Paris?"）.

其实这种人物刻画方式就是海明威“冰山理论”的一个典型运用：不是平铺直叙，而是把人物的性格和经历都隐藏在对话的细微末节里。这对读者也是一大考验，因为需要更多的细心和感受力来构建人物的立体形象。有挑战，但也非常有趣~

### 今日彩蛋

**💧Famous Boulevards around the world**



We went out to the Café Napolitain to have an aperitif and watch the evening crowd on the Boulevard.（我们上街到那波利咖啡馆去喝了一杯开胃酒，然后看着黄昏时林荫大道上散步的人群。）

我们在背景里对巴黎的拉丁区做了介绍，这里聚集着大大小小的休闲咖啡馆。除此之外，我们看到Cohn和Jake还一边坐着观望人流如织的“林荫大道”（Boulevard）.

大家可能对Boulevard这个词比较陌生。虽然是法语词，但它其实源自荷兰语（Dutch）的Bolwerk, 这个词本来是指“堡垒”（bastion）, 通常缩写为Blvd. 后来用来指非常宽大的马路（broad street），两旁树木林立（planted with rows of trees）, 而且往往是贯穿整个城市的（usually running through a city）.

那么世界上都有哪些著名的“林荫大道”呢？今天的彩蛋我们就来看一看~



**1. Champs-Elysées (Paris, France)**

**香榭丽舍大道**

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/fbfa9c300a953fd4e1ecc6ddaa1d7458-sz_289291.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



香榭丽舍大道，位于巴黎市中心商业繁华区，其法文是AVENUE DES CHAMPS ELYSEES. 其中CHAMPS（香）意为田园，ELYSEES（爱丽舍）之意为“极乐世界”或“乐土”，在英文里就是Elysian Fields. “极乐世界”在希腊神话里被认为是英雄们死后所进入的天堂（the paradise for dead heroes）.



她位于卢浮宫与新凯旋门（the Arc de Triomphe）连心中轴线上，又被称为凯旋大道。并且横贯首都巴黎的东西主干道，全长1800米，最宽处约120米，为双向八车道，东起协和广场（the Place de la Concorde），西至戴高乐广场（the Place Charles de Gaulle），东段以自然风光为主；两侧是平坦的英氏草坪，恬静安宁；西段是高级商业区，世界品牌、服装店、香水店都集中在这里（prestigious and luxurious shops are seen in every turn）.

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/304c54063cafc100d9cc7a0e124c382a-sz_367063.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



**2. Lombard Street (San Francisco, USA)**

**九曲花街**

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/902d292a24d2530836a396a51394b9d8-sz_313020.jpeg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



九曲花街的美国官方正式名称为伦巴底街（Lombard Street）. 她位于美国加州圣弗朗西斯科，是一条东西方向贯穿Presidio区及Cow Hollow区的街道。其部分路段（从Broderick街到Van Ness大道）更是美国101高速公路的干线（a major thoroughfare designated as part of U.S. Route 101）. 该街道一直向东伸展，经过俄罗斯山、电报山后，尽头是圣弗朗西斯科海傍的Embarcadero区域。



九曲花街其实很长，但她在Hyde街与Leavenworth街之间的一个很短的街区，却有八个急转弯（eight sharp turns），所以也被称为全世界最弯曲的一条街道（"the crookedest street in the world"）. 而且因为有40度的斜坡，且弯曲像“Z”字形，所以车子只能往下单行。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/76bd7ca2c43809d5f380fa3907ec30f6-sz_201476.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



**3. Michigan Avenue (Chicago, USA)**

**密歇根大街**

密歇根大街是芝加哥市一条南北方向主干道（a north-south street），街道沿途有芝加哥水塔（Chicago Water Tower）、芝加哥艺术学院（Art Institute of Chicago）、千禧公园（Millennium Park）以及“华丽一英里”（Magnificent Mile）. 该街道如今已是芝加哥市一条著名的商业街（the main commercial street），梦露雕像就在这条街上。



密歇根大街桥（Michigan Avenue Bridge）也值得一提，该桥于1920年正式通车，是连接芝加哥南部和北部重要的交通枢纽。

**4. The Strip (Las Vegas, USA)**

**长街（拉斯维加斯大道）**

首先要介绍一下拉斯维加斯的地理区域分布，整个城市分为拉斯维加斯大街（Strip）、老城区（Downtown）以及拉斯维加斯湖区（Lake Las Vegas），尤其是拉斯维加斯大街，以两侧分布着诸多巨型的高级酒店和赌场（resort hotels and casinos）而闻名于世。



世界上十家最大型的度假旅馆在拉斯维加斯就有九间，最大间的就是有5005间房及主题公园的米高美大酒店（MGM Grand Adventure Hotel and Casino）.

乌节路原为一条不知名的乡间小路。1830年初期，路两旁大多为肉豆蔻农场（nutmeg）、胡椒园（pepper）和果园（fruit orchard）.



而今，它已然成为一条风情万种的时尚大街和旅游景点（a major shopping belt and tourist attraction）——全长2.2公里，大道两旁遍布购物中心、餐馆和酒店，从奢华名牌到平价时尚、星级餐厅到连锁速食，应有尽有。

It was a warm spring night and I sat at a table on the terrace of the Napolitain after Robert had gone, watching it get dark and the electric signs come on,

and the red and green stop-and-go traffic-signal, and the crowd going by, and the horse-cabs clippety-clopping along at the edge of the solid taxi traffic,

and the poules (妓女) going by, singly and in pairs, looking for the evening meal.

I watched a good-looking girl walk past the table and watched her go up the street and lost sight of her, and watched another, and then saw the first one coming back again.

She went by once more and I caught her eye, and she came over and sat down at the table. The waiter came up.

>
> 也可以表示“使某人产生兴趣”（to attract one's interest）, 一般是通过外表视觉上的吸引（to be visually appealing）, 比如：I see that the new girl in school has caught your eye.（我发现你对那个新来的女孩很感兴趣。）

"Well, what will you drink?" I asked. "Pernod."

"That's not good for little girls."

"Little girl yourself. Dites garcon, un pernod (服务员，来一杯茴香酒)."

"A pernod for me, too." "What's the matter?" she asked. "Going on a party?"

"Sure. Aren't you?" "I don't know. You never know in this town."

"Don't you like Paris?" "No."

"Why don't you go somewhere else?" "Isn't anywhere else."

"You're happy, all right." "Happy, hell!"

Pernod is greenish imitation absinthe. When you add water it turns milky.

I paid for the saucers and we walked out to the street. I hailed a horse-cab and the driver pulled up at the curb.

Settled back in the slow, smoothly rolling fiacre (马车) we moved up the Avenue de l'Opéra (歌剧院大街),passed the locked doors of the shops, their windows lighted, the Avenue broad and shiny and almost deserted.

The cab passed the New York Herald (《先驱报》) bureau with the window full of clocks.

> ==bureau英 [ˈbjʊərəʊ] 美 [ˈbjʊroʊ] n. 局；（提供某方面信息的）办事处；（美国政府部门）局；（附抽屉及活动写字台的）书桌==

"What are all the clocks for?" she asked.

"They show the hour all over America." "Don't kid me."

We turned off the Avenue up the Rue des Pyramides (金字塔街), through the traffic of the Rue de Rivoli (丽弗里街), and through a dark gate into the Tuileries (杜伊勒利宫).

She cuddled against me and I put my arm around her. She looked up to be kissed.

> ==cuddle英 [ˈkʌdl] 美 [ˈkʌdl:] vt.& vi. 拥抱，怀抱 vi. 依偎着睡==

She touched me with one hand and I put her hand away.

"Never mind." "What's the matter? You sick?"

"Yes." "Everybody's sick. I'm sick, too."

We came out of the Tuileries into the light and crossed the Seine and then turned up the Rue des Saints Péres (教皇路).

"You oughtn't to drink pernod if you're sick." "You neither."

"It doesn't make any difference with me. It doesn't make any difference with a woman."

"What are you called?" "Georgette. How are you called?"

"Jacob." "That's a Flemish name." "American too."

"You're not Flamand?" "No, American." "Good, I detest Flamands."

> ==detest英 [dɪˈtest] 美 [dɪˈtɛst] vt. 憎恶，嫌恶，痛恨==

By this time we were at the restaurant. I called to the cocher (车夫) to stop. We got out and Georgette did not like the looks of the place.

"This is no great thing of a restaurant." "No," I said.

"Maybe you would rather go to Foyot's. Why don't you keep the cab and go on?"

I had picked her up because of a vague sentimental idea that it would be nice to eat with some one.

It was a long time since I had dined with a poule, and I had forgotten how dull it could be.

We went into the restaurant, passed Madame Lavigne at the desk and into a little room. Georgette cheered up a little under the food.

"It isn't bad here," she said. "It isn't chic, but the food is all right."

> ==chic==
>
> adj. 别致的；<法>漂亮的，时髦的
>
> 原文："It isn't chic, but the food is all right."

> “说不上时髦，不过饭菜还不错。”
>
> 💧chic这个词也来自于法语，不仅指普通的“时髦漂亮”（stylish），还是非常“高贵雅致”的（elegant）. “都市时髦”就是urban chic.
>
> 💧此外chic还可以指“某个行业或领域里的兴趣或潮流”，比如：The academic chic is transient.（学术界的研究兴趣是一直在改变的。）

"Better than you eat in Liege (列日，比利时东部大城市)." "Brussels, you mean."

We had another bottle of wine and Georgette made a joke. She smiled and showed all her bad teeth, and we touched glasses.

"You're not a bad type," she said. "It's a shame you're sick. We get on well. What's the matter with you, anyway?"

"I got hurt in the war," I said. "Oh, that dirty war."

We would probably have gone on and discussed the war and agreed that it was in reality a calamity for civilization, and perhaps would have been better avoided.

I was bored enough. Just then from the other room some one called: "Barnes! I say, Barnes! Jacob Barnes!

"It's a friend calling me," I explained,and went out.

There was Braddocks at a big table with a party: Cohn, Frances Clyne, Mrs. Braddocks, several people I did not know.

"You're coming to the dance, aren't you?" Braddocks asked.

"What dance?" "Why, the dancings. Don't you know we've revived them?" Mrs. Braddocks put in.

> ==revive英 [rɪˈvaɪv] 美 [rɪˈvaɪv] vt. 使复活，使恢复；使振奋，复原==

You must come, Jake. We're all going," Frances said from the end of the table. She was tall and had a smile.

"Of course, he's coming," Braddocks said. "Come in and have coffee with us, Barnes."

"Right." "And bring your friend," said Mrs. Braddocks laughing. She was a Canadian and had all their easy social graces.

> *graces还经常以短语airs and graces的形式出现，带有贬义，指“装腔作势，矫揉造作”，比如：She's very rich, but she doesn't give herself any airs and graces.（她很有钱，但从来不摆出装腔作势的样子。）

"Thanks, we'll be in," I said. I went back to the small room.

"Who are your friends?" Georgette asked.

"Writers and artists." "There are lots of those on this side of the river."

"Too many." "I think so. Still, some of them make money."

"Oh, yes." We finished the meal and the wine. "Come on," I said.

"We're going to have coffee with the others."

Georgette opened her bag, made a few passes at her face as she looked in the little mirror, re-defined her lips with the lip-stick, and straightened her hat.<br>"Good," she said.

"Good," she said. We went into the room full of people and Braddocks and the men at his table stood up.

"I wish to present my fiancée, Mademoiselle Georgette Leblanc," I said. Georgette smiled that wonderful smile, and we shook hands all round.

"Are you related to Georgette Leblanc, the singer?" Mrs. Braddocks asked.

"No," said Georgette. "Not at all. My name is Hobin."

"But Mr. Barnes introduced you as Mademoiselle Georgette Leblanc. Surely he did," insisted Mrs. Braddocks, who in the excitement of talking French was liable to have no idea what she was saying.

"He's a fool," Georgette said. "Oh, it was a joke, then," Mrs. Braddocks said.

"Yes," said Georgette. "To laugh at."

"Did you hear that, Henry?" Mrs. Braddocks called down the table to Braddocks. "Mr. Barnes introduced his fiancee as Mademoiselle Leblanc, and her name is actually Hobin."

"Of course, darling. Mademoiselle Hobin, I've known her for a very long time."

"Oh, Mademoiselle Hobin," Frances Clyne calIed, speaking French very rapidly and not seeming so proud and astonished as Mrs. Braddocks at its coming out really French.

>
> *its (the speaking's)  coming out是“形容词性物主代词+doing”的结构。

"Have you been in Paris long? Do you like it here? You love Paris, do you not?"

"Who's she?" Georgette turned to me. "Do I have to talk to her?"

She turned to Frances, sitting smiling, her hands folded, her head poised on her long neck, her lips pursed ready to start talking again.

"No, I don't like Paris. It's expensive and dirty."

"Really? I find it so extraordinarily clean. One of the cleanest cities in all Europe." "I find it dirty."

"How strange! But perhaps you have not been here very long."

"I've been here long enough." "But it does have nice people in it. One must grant that."

Georgette turned to me. "You have nice friends."

Frances was a little drunk and would have liked to have kept it up but the coffee came, and Lavigne with the liqueurs (利口酒), and after that we all went out and started for Braddocks's dancing-club.

### 背景知识

**💧Le Café Napolitain 那不勒斯咖啡馆**

在昨天的背景里我们介绍到左岸（The Left Bank）是巴黎的文化艺术中心，自然咖啡馆也是满街林立的。法国人本身爱喝咖啡，到什么程度呢？——他们会自我调侃道：“我不在咖啡馆，就是去咖啡馆的路上。”

由此也催生出了蓬勃的街头咖啡（pavement cafe）文化，很多咖啡馆都是直接开在人行道边上，室外支个阳伞或雨棚。一般全天24小时不歇业，提供早餐和夜宵，行人可以随时停下来歇脚喝杯咖啡，跟我们的“大排档”很类似。

而咖啡馆之于巴黎的文人墨客，更是是灵魂休憩、思想碰撞的地方。比如我们的小说主角们十分喜欢的这家咖啡馆Napolitain Café（那不勒斯咖啡馆），就大有来头。

Napolitain也可以写成Neapolitain, 本义是指“那不勒斯（人）的”。那不勒斯（Naples）是意大利南部的一座城市，以其丰富的历史、文化、艺术和美食而著称。据说那不勒斯咖啡馆的老板会给每位到店的客人赠送一份意大利冰激凌。

这座那不勒斯咖啡馆就坐落在巴黎卡布辛大道1号（number 1 Boulevard des Capucines）, 这里也是巴黎的四大林荫大道之一（one of the four "Grands Boulevards"）. 它的装饰风格以“军事”为主题（with a military theme），这是为了庆祝1892年“法俄同盟”（Franco-Russian Alliance）的成立。

除了海明威本人在1921到1928年居住巴黎的期间经常光临（frequented）这家咖啡馆，许多著名的艺术家和作者也聚集（congregated）在此高谈阔论，比如提出“迷惘的一代”称号的美国作家（Gertrude Stein）, 法国后印象派三大巨匠之一的保罗·高更（Paul Gauguin）, 西班牙现代派画家巴勃罗·毕加索（Pablo Picasso）, 以及美国意象派诗人的鼻祖埃兹拉·庞德（Ezra Pound）.

除了那不勒斯咖啡馆，巴黎还有不少文艺工作者们青睐的咖啡馆。比如蒙巴纳斯街上的丁香咖啡馆（la closerie des lilas）, 这里的常客包括美国作家亨利·米勒（Henry Miller）和爱尔兰作家詹姆斯·乔伊斯（James Joyce）, 当然还包括海明威。比如时值今日，这家咖啡馆还保留着海明威经常坐的椅子，椅背上的铜牌镌刻着他的名字。

在圣日耳曼教堂对面的花神咖啡馆（Café de Flore）和它隔壁的双偶咖啡馆（Les Deux Magots）则是存在主义大师萨特（Sartre）和波伏娃（Beauvoir）日常讨论和写作的地方。正是坐在花神咖啡馆临街的窗口，波伏娃给她的美国情人奥尔格伦写下了那些热烈的情书。

### 课文理解

一个温暖的春日夜晚，Jake坐在那不勒斯咖啡馆的露天平台上百无聊赖，打量着街道上的景象和人来人往。一个妓女似乎是被他吸引住了，想着多一个饭友不是坏事，于是他便邀请这个叫Georgette的姑娘一同去吃饭。在马车上，Georgette主动地搂抱住他，想要和他继续亲热，但Jake却拒绝了。这个细节在整本小说中都非常重要，也可以说它向我们揭示了关于Jake的一个致命弱点——



💧**Clue 1**: Jake is physically impotent, especially in a sexual sense.



**Evidence 1**: She looked up to be kissed. She touched me with one hand and I put her hand away.

"Never mind."

"What's the matter? You sick?"

"Yes."

"Everybody's sick. I'm sick, too."

她抬头期待我的亲吻。她伸手摸我，我把她的手推开。

“别这样。”

“怎么啦？你有病？”

“是的。”

“谁没病？我也有病。”



**Evidence 2**: "You're not a bad type," she said. "It's a shame you're sick. We get on well. What's the matter with you, anyway?"

"I got hurt in the war," I said.

“你这人不坏，”她说，“真可惜你染上了病。咱们挺说得来。不过你到底会怎么弄的？”

“是在战场上受了伤。”我说。



Jake在这里很隐晦地表明了自己有身体的不适或毛病，sick这个词很宽泛模糊，在这里的语境下可以有不只一种暗指。并且他说“Everybody's sick. I'm sick, too.”的时候口气明显敷衍。直到Georgette再一次不识时务地提起这个话题，他才透露自己是在战场上受了伤。关于这段具体的经历他其实也很避讳提起——



💧**Clue 2**: Jake is not that willing to talk about his past.



**Evidence 1**: We would probably have gone on and discussed the war and agreed that it was in reality a calamity for civilization, and perhaps would have been better avoided. I was bored enough.

我们本来会继续谈下去，会议论那次大战，会一致认为战争实质上是对文明的一场浩劫，也许最好能避免战争。我厌烦透了。



想到那场战争以及其遗留的伤害让他变得很不耐烦，这也是到目前为止我们在Jake身上感受到的一种很明显的特质——沉闷易怒。比如在前面和Cohn的对话中，他不声不响地就给Cohn泼了一头冷水，并且还以“I've tried all that”这样的话来打发他，但他往往在说到涉及个人经历的时候就戛然而止了，明显不想过多地谈论自己的过去。



那么到底是什么样的经历造就了这样的Jake呢？明天的故事里我们就会看到答案。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧可能是最“走心”的英文词根了：cor/cour/cord**



"But you have the same name," Mrs. Braddocks insisted cordially.（“可是你们俩同名同姓，”布雷克多斯太太真诚地说。）

cordially表示“真情实意地”，它的含义是从词根cord延伸出来的：cord在拉丁语里表示heart, 所以cordial表示with heart, “用心地”，也就是对别人掏心掏肺啦~

其实cord这个词根还可以再深究，它最早的形式是cor, 后来才变形延伸出了cour以及cord. 这三个词根都是和心脏有关的，我们来分别看一下~



**💧由cor形成的词汇**



core

由cor构成的主要就是这个词根本身啦~当它作名词的时候，从“心脏”这个含义延伸出了“果心，果核”、“（组织的）核心成员”以及抽象意义上的“核心，最重要的部分”，比如：

Debt is at the core of the problem.

债务是问题的关键。

还有一句俚语表达：to the core, 表示“……深入到内核、本质”，也就是“彻底地，完全地”（extremely and completely）, 比如：

That woman is rotten to the core!

那个女人坏透了！

It hurt me to the core.



He was a bureaucrat to the core.

他是个十足的官僚。

除此之外，core作形容词可以表示“主要的，核心的”，比如core curriculum（核心课程），core business（核心业务），core values（核心价值观）等等。



**💧由cour形成的词汇**



courage (courageous, encourage, discourage)

courage起初由拉丁语进入法语，在这个过程中经历了一系列的变形：cor (拉丁语)→coraticum (通俗/平民拉丁语)→corage (古法语)→corage (中世纪英语)→courage (现代英语)

从14世纪开始，corage的含义就不再仅限于指“心脏”这一身体器官了，而引申出了表示“人的心理状态，想法，品性”等。比如：*bold* *corage* (brave heart “勇敢”); *fre* *corage* (free will “自由意志”); *wikked* *corage* (wicked/evil heart “坏心肠”) 等。



但今天courage的含义大大缩小，就只有*bold corage*这层表示“勇气”的意思啦~



**💧由cord形成的词汇**



\1. concord

con表示with, together; 所以con+cord在字面上的意思是hearts together, 引申为with the same mind. 

大家都想到一起去了，也就是达成“一致，协调”，相当于harmony, 比如：

The marital rift was short lasting, ending in concord.

婚姻生活的不和谐持续了一小段时间，但最终还是归于和睦。

concord的另一层意思是“共识，协议”，相当于agreement, treaty.

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/d27c39478865e44e13b93940042d9c8d-sz_76111.jpg?x-oss-process=image/resize,w_1080/auto-orient,1/crop,x_0,y_194,w_620,h_206)



\2. accord

accord的含义和concord很相近。首先看ac-这个前缀来自ad-, 表示to; 所以ac+cord就是指bring heart to heart, 引申为come into agreement, be in harmony.

accord作名词可以表示“符合，一致”，比如：

These results are in accord with earlier research.

这些结果和先前的研究一致。

同时和concord一样也可以表示“协议”，比如：

The union reached an accord with management at 4: 30 this afternoon.

工会于今天下午4点30分和管理层达成了协议。

accord还有一个非常好用的表达：of one's own accord, “出于自己本心的”也就是follow one's heart啦~

引申为“自愿地，主动地”（voluntarily, without being forced），比如：

He decided to go of his own accord.

他是自己决定要去的。

The door seemed to move of its own accord.

那扇门似乎自己在动。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/7e9547b9de52a249a09abe379e9186aa-sz_3022768.jpg?x-oss-process=image/resize,w_1080/auto-orient,1/crop,x_0,y_115,w_1080,h_353/format,jpg)



\3. discordant

介绍完前面的两个，这个单词就很好理解了。dis-是表示否定的前缀，-ant是形容词后缀，连起来理解是“在本质上不相融，不和谐的”（conflicting in nature）, 相当于contradictory.



这种不和谐可以指听觉/音乐上的，比如：

Modern classical music just sounds discordant to me. 

现代的古典音乐在我听来就是不和谐。



或者是某物和周围的环境不协调，比如：

The modern decor strikes a discordant note in this old building.

现代化的装潢与这座古老的建筑本身很不协调。

（strike a discordant note这个表达也是从音乐里面引申出来的：note表示音符，strike就是敲打、弹奏)

*还有一个很常见的单词也是由cord构成的，大家想到了不妨也去查一查词源了解它的由来哦，也欢迎和老师一起分享~（给大家推荐一个英文的词源网站：Online Etymology Dictionary）

The dancing-club was a bal musette(小风琴舞会) in the Rue de la Montagne Sainte Genevieve (圣朱维夫山之路).

Five nights a week the working people of the Pantheon (先贤祠) quarter danced there.

One night a week it was the dancingclub.

On Monday nights it was closed.

When we arrived it was quite empty, except for a policeman sitting near the door, the wife of the proprietor back of the zinc bar, and the proprietor himself.

> ==proprietor英 [prəˈpraɪətə(r)] 美 [prəˈpraɪɪtɚ] n. 所有人，业主；地主==

The daughter of the house came down-stairs as we went in.

There were long benches, and tables ran across the room, and at the far end a dancing-floor.

"I wish people would come earlier," Braddocks said.

The daughter came up and wanted to know what we would drink.

The proprietor got up on a high stool beside the dancing-floor and began to play the accordion.

> ==accordion英 [əˈkɔ:diən] 美 [əˈkɔ:rdiən] n. 手风琴==

He had a string of bells around one of his ankles and beat time with his foot as he played

Every one danced. It was hot and we came off the floor perspiring.

"My God," Georgette said. "What a box to sweat in!"

> <font color=red>"My God," Georgette said. "What a box to sweat in!"</font>
>
> “我的上帝，”乔杰特说。“屋里活像个蒸笼！”

> "What a box to sweat in!"不是指大家在盒子里大汗淋漓。box有“包厢”（一般空间狭小）的意思，比如剧院里的包厢就是用box来代指。但这里的box还不只是指包厢，结合后面的sweat, 这里指的很可能是sweat box, 也就是桑拿房（sauna bar）.
>
> *作者没有直接写明是sweat box其实也是为了营造一定的想象空间，同时利用box的多个歧义：“盒子”、“包厢”等，来暗示这个俱乐部里边空间很小，人挤人的非常闷热。 

"It's hot."

"Hot, my God!"

"Take off your hat."

"That's a good idea."

Some one asked Georgette to dance, and I went over to the bar.

It was really very hot and the accordion music was pleasant in the hot night.

I drank a beer, standing in the doorway and getting the cool breath of wind from the street.

Two taxis were coming down the steep street.

They both stopped in front of the Bal.

A crowd of young men, some in jerseys and some in their shirt-sleeves, got out.

I could see their hands and newly washed, wavy hair in the light from the door.

The policeman standing by the door looked at me and smiled

They came in. As they went in, under the light I saw white hands, wavy hair, white faces, grimacing, gesturing, talking.

> ==grimace英 [grɪˈmeɪs] 美 [ˈɡrɪmɪs, ɡrɪˈmes] n. 鬼脸，怪相；痛苦的表情 vi. 扮怪相，做鬼脸==

With them was Brett.

She looked very lovely and she was very much with them.

> <font color=red>She looked very lovely and she was very much with them.</font>
>
> 她模样怪可爱的，还和他们打成了一片。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> she was very much with them 可能有点难理解，这里very much是俚语的一种用法，表示强调，我们先来看一个句子：She is very much in control of the situation.（她正掌控着情况。）
>
> 因此原文里very much可以看成是强调she was “with” them. 也就是她跟他们在一起一点都不奇怪违和，看上去很玩得来。

One of them saw Georgette and said: "I do declare. There is an actual harlot. I'm going to dance with her, Lett. You watch me."

The tall dark one, called Lett, said: "Don't you be rash.".

The wavy blond one answered: "Don't you worry, dear." And with them was Brett.

I was very angry. Somehow they always made me angry.

I know they are supposed to be amusing, and you should be tolerant, but I wanted to swing on one, any one, anything to shatter that superior, simpering composure.

>
> I’m not supposed to tell anyone. 我不能告诉任何人的。
>
> He’s supposed to be very clever. 据说他非常聪明。
>
> ②to swing on one, any one, anything to shatter...调整语序后是：to swing anything on one, any one, to shatter...（不定式结构在这里作目的状语）；swing sth on/at sb表示“抡起……向某人砸去”，swing本义是“摇摆，摇动”，所以表示击打这个动作的时候就是抡圆了胳膊朝对方挥过去；这里的sth在原文里就是anything;
>
> ③to shatter that superior, simpering composure“来砸掉那种目中无人、傻笑中透着泰然自若的神情”；shatter表示“使粉碎，破灭”，比如“打破宁静”就是shatter the silence/peace；superior也就是“高傲的，有优越感的”；simpering指“傻笑的”，但一般带有贬义，形容的是很矫揉造作地装无辜的傻笑；composure表示“冷静，镇定”（calmness）.
>
> *Jake看到和Brett同行的这些男性对Georgette的态度的非常轻佻，更加对他们感觉厌恶和不满。比如他们直呼Georgette为harlot（妓女，荡妇），以及故意跟她跳舞捉弄她（"I'm going to dance with her, Lett. You watch me."The tall dark one, called Lett, said: "Don't you be rash." The wavy blond one answered: "Don't you worry, dear."）

Instead, I walked down the street and had a beer at the bar at the next Bal.

The beer was not good and I had a worse cognac to take the taste Out of my mouth

When I came back to the Bal there was a crowd on the floor and Georgette was dancing with the tall blond youth, who danced big-hippily,carrying his head on one side, his eyes lifted as he danced.

As soon as the music stopped another one of them asked her to dance.

She had been taken up by them.

I knew then that they would all dance with her.

They are like that.

I sat down at a table.

Cohn was sitting there. Frances was dancing.

Mrs. Braddocks brought up somebody and introduced him as Robert Prentiss.

He was from New York by way of Chicago, and was a rising new novelist.

He had some sort of an English accent. I asked him to have a drink.

"Thanks so much," he said, "I've just had one."

"Have another." "Thanks, I will then."

We got the daughter of the house over and each had a fine a l'eau (兑水的白兰地).

"You're from Kansas City, they tell me," he said.

"Yes."Do you find Paris amusing?"

"Yes."Really?"

I was a little drunk. Not drunk in any positive sense but just enough to be careless.

> <font color=red>I was a little drunk. Not drunk in any positive sense but just enough to be careless.</font>
>
> 我已有几分醉意。并没有真醉，但说起话来已经到了口不择言的程度。

> ①in any positive sense “没有真的”；positive在这里表示“肯定的，确信的”（certain）, 还可以直接作为问题的答语，比如：‘Are you sure about that?’ ‘Positive.’（“那事你能肯定吗？”“能。”）
>
> ②but just enough to 直译是“但是刚好能够做”，在这里应该理解为“但是已经到了什么样的程度”，两种理解的语气不同；第一种是你希望有足够的什么东西，而当下的情况是刚好够；第二种则相反，你反而不希望有那么多。所以这里的语气表示的是：虽然没有完全醉，但已经足够到不择词句的地步了。

"For God's sake," I said, "yes. Don't you?"

"Oh, how charmingly you get angry," he said. "I wish I had that faculty."

>
> She had a great faculty for absorbing information.

> 她吸收信息的能力很强。

I got up and walked over toward the dancing-floor.

Mrs. Braddocks followed me. "Don't be cross with Robert," she said.

"He's still only a child, you know."

"I wasn't cross," I said. "I just thought perhaps I was going to throw up."

"Your fiancé is having a great success," Mrs. Braddocks looked out on the floor where Georgette was dancing in the arms of the tall, dark one, called Lett.

"Isn't she?" I said."Rather," said Mrs. Braddocks.

Cohn came up. "Come on, Jake," he said, "have a drink."

We walked over to the bar. "What's the matter with you? You seem all worked up over something?"

> <font color=red>"What's the matter with you? You seem all worked up over something?"</font>
>
> “你怎么啦？好像被什么事惹火了。”

>
> ①all 在这里表示“非常，甚”（pretty much）, 主要用于强调不好的情形，常和too连用，比如：In these conditions it was all too easy to make mistakes. 在这些情况下很容易犯错。
>
> ②work sb up 表示“激起某人情绪”（to arouse one's emotions）, 尤其指“使某人生气”，后面的over表示“因为什么事情”，比如：
>
> I think you're working yourself up over nothing. I'm sure the doctor will tell you it's nothing.
>
> 我觉得你是在毫无理由地发脾气。我敢肯定，医生会告诉你这其实没什么大不了的。

"Nothing. This whole show makes me sick is all."

Brett came up to the bar. "Hello, you chaps."

"Hello, Brett," I said. "Why aren't you tight?"

> <font color=red>"Hello, Brett," I said. "Why aren't you tight?"</font>
>
> “嗨，勃莱特，”我说。“你怎么没喝醉？”
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> tight 在这里是一种过时的俚语表达，意思是“喝醉的”（drunk）. 再为大家拓展几个关于tight的地道用法：
>
> 表示“（胸/胃/喉）感觉憋闷的，不适的”：这个很好理解，feel tight也就是感觉某个部位难受地发紧”；比如：
>
> Before she went on stage her chest felt tight and her throat hurt.
>
> 她上台前胸口发闷，喉咙疼痛。
>
> 表示“生气的，担忧的”：可以和“紧闭双唇”这个动作联系起来，因此tight-lipped不是因为闷闷不乐，就是因为太过担心而勉强挤出笑容；比如：
>
> ‘Look, I’m sorry…,’ she said, forcing a tight smile.
>
> “噢，我很抱歉……”她说道，勉强挤出一丝生硬的笑容。

"Never going to get tight any more. I say, give a chap a brandy and soda."

She stood holding the glass and I saw Robert Cohn looking at her.

He looked a great deal as his compatriot must have looked when he saw the promised land.

> ==compatriot英 [kəmˈpætriət] 美 [kəmˈpeɪtriət] n. 同胞；同国人 adj. 同胞的；同国人的==

Cohn, of course, was much younger. But he had that look of eager, deserving expectation.

Brett was damned good-looking.

She wore a slipover jersey sweater and a tweed skirt, and her hair was brushed back like a boy's.

She started all that. She was built with curves like the hull of a racing yacht, and you missed none of it with that wool jersey.

>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①a slipover jersey sweater “一件针织套衫”；slipover是“套衫”的意思，slip over作动词短语是“漫不经心，套”的意思，所以slipover就是因为这种衣服的穿着方式很简单而得名，也可以称作是pullover; jersey和sweater都是“针织衫”的意思，主要指套头无扣的那种；
>
> ②a tweed skirt “一条苏格兰粗呢裙子”，我们在盖茨比里也提到了苏格兰特色的裙子，但那个是花呢的，叫作plaid skirt.
>
> ③the hull of a racing yacht “赛艇的船身”；hull指“船体，船身”，比如steel-hulled表示“船体是钢质的”；此外hull还可以指“种子，谷物等的外壳”（husk）.
>
> ④miss none of it “一点都不会错过”，it在这里指Brett的body curves.
>
> *这一段在语言上其实别具心裁，比如she在句首的反复使用，这在一般情况下是不符合英语的简洁和流畅规则的。但在这里的效果是强调Brett深深勾住了Jake的视线，一反他在之前情节中的颓废无聊，暗示了Brett对他的特殊性。

"It's a fine crowd you're with, Brett,"?I said.

"Aren't they lovely? And you, my dear. Where did you get it?"

"At the Napolitain." "And have you had a lovely evening?"

"Oh, priceless," I said.

Brett laughed. "It's wrong of you, Jake. It's an insult to all of us. Look at Frances there, and Jo."

This for Cohn's benefit.

"It's in restraint of trade," Brett said. She laughed again.

"You're wonderfully sober," I said.

"Yes. Aren't I? And when one's with the crowd I'm with, one can drink in such safety, too."

The music started and Robert Cohn said: "Will you dance this with me, Lady Brett?"

Brett smiled at him. "I've promised to dance this with Jacob," she laughed.

"You've a hell of a biblical name, Jake."

"How about the next?" asked Cohn.

"We're going," Brett said. "We've a date up at Montmartre (蒙马特，巴黎北区). "

Dancing, I looked over Brett's shoulder and saw Cohn, standing at the bar, still watching her.

"You've made a new one there," I said to her.

"Don't talk about it. Poor chap. I never knew it till just now."

"Oh, well," I said. "I suppose you like to add them up."

"Don't talk like a fool." "You do."

"Oh, well. What if I do?"

"Nothing," I said. We were dancing to the accordion and some one was playing the banjo.

It was hot and I felt happy. We passed close to Georgette dancing with another one of them.

"What possessed you to bring her?"

> ==possess==
>
> vt. 拥有;掌握，懂得;主宰;缠住，迷住
>
> 原文："What possessed you to bring her?"
>
> “什么东西迷住了你，让你把她带来的？”
>
> 💧possess在这里是双关：首先是指“占据某人的头脑，迷住”（to occupy fully the mind of）, 比如：
>
> The dancers were possessed by the music.
>
> 舞者们完全沉浸在音乐里了。
>
> 💧其次是指“驱使某人做”（to force sb to do）, 一般是问话者对于对方做的一件蠢事表示无法理解，比如：
>
> What on earth possessed her to do it?
>
> 到底是什么让她干出这种事的？

"I don't know, I just brought her." "You're getting damned romantic."

"No, bored."

"Now?" "No, not now."

"Let's get out of here. She's well taken care of."

"Do you want to?"

"Would I ask you if I didn't want to?"

We left the floor and I took my coat off a hanger on the wall and put it on.

Brett stood by the bar. Cohn was talking to her.

I stopped at the bar and asked them for an envelope.

The patronne (酒吧老板娘) found one.

I took a fifty-franc note from my pocket, put it in the envelope, sealed it, and handed it to the patronne.

"If the girl I came with asks for me, will you give her this?" I said. "If she goes out with one of those gentlemen, will you save this for me?"

"C'est entendu, Monsieur (一言为定，先生)," the patronne said. "You go now? So early?"

"Yes," I said. We started out the door.

Cohn was still talking to Brett. She said good night and took my arm.

"Good night, Cohn," I said.

Outside in the street we looked for a taxi.

"You're going to lose your fifty francs," Brett said.

"Oh, yes." "No taxis."

"We could walk up to the Pantheon and get one."

"Come on and we'll get a drink in the pub next door and send for one."

"You wouldn't walk across the street." "Not if I could help it."

We went into the next bar and I sent a waiter for a taxi.

"Well," I said, "we're out away from them."

We stood against the tall zinc bar and did not talk and looked at each other.

The waiter came and said the taxi was outside.

Brett pressed my hand hard. I gave the waiter a franc and we went out.

"Where should I tell him?" I asked. "Oh, tell him to drive around."

I told the driver to go to the Parc Montsouris (蒙苏里公园), and got in,and slammed the door.

Brett was leaning back in the corner, her eyes closed

I sat beside her. The cab started with a jerk.

"Oh, darling, I've been so miserable," Brett said.

### 背景知识

**💧1. Panthéon 先贤祠**

Five nights a week the working people of the Pantheon quarter danced there.（每周有五个晚上，先贤祠区的劳动人民们都在这里跳舞。）

这里提到的Panthéon（先贤祠）其实就在我们介绍过的巴黎左岸的拉丁区（Latin Quarter）. Panthéon是法语，但最早来自希腊语，含义是“所有的神”（pan表示“所有的，泛的”，theo表示“神”）. 这类的建筑，通常以供奉诸神而著称。例如公元前五世纪古希腊人修筑的雅典巴特农神庙（Parthenon）, 便是供奉着这世上所有的神灵。类似的建筑，意大利也有一所，也即我们所熟知的“万神殿”（也叫Pantheon）.

先贤祠原是路易十五时代建成的一座教堂，供奉着巴黎的守护女神——“圣热纳维耶芙” （Sainte Geneviève）的圣物，1791年被收归国有脱离宗教后，改为埋葬“伟人”的墓地；1814年到1830年间，它又归还教会；现在是永久纪念法国历史名人的圣殿。

先贤祠中的艺术装饰非常美观，其穹顶（dome）上的大型壁画是名画家安托万·格罗特创作的。1830年“七月革命”之后，绘画的主题改变，先贤祠具有了“纯粹的爱国与民族”特性。

先贤祠内安葬着伏尔泰（Voltaire）、卢梭（Rousseau）、维克多·雨果（Victor Hugo）、爱弥尔·左拉（ Émile Zola）、居里夫人（Marie Curie）和大仲马（Alexandre Dumas）等。



**💧2. Bal Musette 手风琴舞会**



The dancing-club was a *bal* *musette* in the Rue de la Montagne Sainte Genevieve.（这家跳舞俱乐部里跳的都是手风琴舞，位置就在圣杰尼维耶弗山路上。）

Jake一伙人吃完晚饭后的消遣是去一家俱乐部里跳手风琴舞。这里的*bal musette*是在1880s风靡于巴黎的一种音乐和舞蹈形式，特点就是以手风琴（accordion）为主角。

这种风格并不是巴黎本地的产物，而是来自法国中部的奥弗涅大区（Auvergne）的地方舞蹈和民乐。当时很多奥弗涅人（Auvergnats）居住在法国的第5、11、12区（arrondissement）, 第5区也就是我们上面提到的先贤祠区，这一片都属于拉丁区的范围。他们在自己的居住区内开了很多的酒吧，里面跳的就是他们民间的bourrée舞——节奏轻快，还有手风琴伴奏。

手风琴舞大受欢迎的原因是简单易学、移动敏捷，而且舞步性感，也不需要太大的场地，在小酒吧里空间正合适。

这些地方虽然主要是穷人的活动场地，但也经常有法国的上层名流来到这里找乐子。而且店主们有时候会为了这些“大老板”的利益，故意制造警察突袭的恐慌（some establishments even staged mock police raids for their patrons' benefit）, 好让其他人都被吓跑。

到1945年，手风琴舞已经走到了法国时髦的最前沿，还掀起了一股对于手风琴舞者的追星潮。但是到了1960年，它的热度就开始急剧褪减（declined drastically）. 今天手风琴舞在融入现代元素后，也展露出了复兴的劲头（a revival has begun）.

### 课文理解

Jake和Georgette跟着大伙一起到了手风琴舞会上。但Jake显然提不起兴致，里面又小又热，所以他也不跳舞，就站在门口的过道上吹外面的凉风（I drank a beer, standing in the doorway and getting the cool breath of wind from the street）.

直到门口停下了两辆出租车，走出来的是一个叫Brett的女人，还有她的“男伴们”。Jake看到他们的妆容打扮莫名怒火中烧（I was very angry.）而且他还强调了一句一直以来都是如此（Somehow they always made me angry）. 这里其实暗藏了一条线索，Jake是个恐同者。我们可以从他对这群男伴的描述中看出来——



💧**Clue 1**:  Jake is homophobia.



**Evidence 1**: As they went in, under the light I saw white hands, wavy hair, white faces, grimacing, gesturing, talking.

当他们挤眉弄眼、比比划划、七嘴八舌地往里走的时候，在灯光下我看清他们的白手、卷发和白脸。

Jake在这里强调white是带着鄙夷的，比如他们可能只是在脸上擦脂抹粉了，但在Jake看来就是全身能露的出来的地方都是白花花的。以及三个词grimacing, gesturing, talking的连用也表明了他的厌恶：在语言层面上，-ing形式本身就有表示某件事持续进行而让人很厌烦的意思。



**Evidence 2**: When I came back to the Bal there was a crowd on the floor and Georgette was dancing with the tall blond youth, who danced big-hippily, carrying his head on one side, his eyes lifted as he danced.

当我回到舞厅的时候，舞池里挤满了人，乔杰特正和那个高个子的金发小伙在跳舞。他跳舞的时候，使劲扭动臀部，歪着脑袋，眼睛朝上斜吊着。



big-hippily是一个很冒犯人的词，hippy（也可以拼作hippie）指“臀部大的”，而且主要是用来形容女性。这里是Jake很不满这个金发小伙跳舞的时候拼命扭捏身姿。



大家可能疑惑的另一个点是，为什么Jake看到Brett和这些男伴在一起也会如此不舒服呢？比如他颇具挖苦地说了一句she was very much with them（她和他们打成一片），以及在Brett首次出现的时候，Jake形容她的口吻就像是俩人已经认识一样（with hem was Brett）. 这里作者再次向我们隐瞒了一个线索，也就是Jake和Brett其实是一对旧情人。我们可以在他们虽然看似平淡但实则暗流涌动的对话里找到佐证——



💧**Clue 2**:  Jake and Brett used to be intimate.



**Evidence 1**: Dancing, I looked over Brett's shoulder and saw Cohn, standing at the bar, still watching her.

"You've made a new one there," I said to her.

"Don't talk about it. Poor chap. I never knew it till just now."

"Oh, well," I said. "I suppose you like to add them up."

跳舞的时候，我从勃莱特的肩膀上望过去，只见科恩在酒吧柜边站着，仍然盯着她看。

“你又迷住了一个人，”我对她说。

“别谈这个。可怜的家伙，我也是刚刚才发觉。”

“哦，好嘛，”我说。“依我看你是多多益善吧。”



虽然Jake很想装出若无其事的口吻，但这股打翻了醋坛子的酸味读者透着纸就能嗅到了。以及一直到离开俱乐部之前，他的视线都没离开过Cohn和Brett, 比如他一直在反复强调，Brett要么拿着酒杯要么站在吧台边上，而这时候Cohn都在看着她：



She stood holding the glass and I saw Robert Cohn looking at her.

Brett stood by the bar. Cohn was talking to her.



说明Jake心里极为介意Cohn对Brett也产生了好感，当然不可避免地我们的故事从此就要拉开一个感情三角了。



**Evidence 2**: "Oh, darling, I've been so miserable," Brett said.

“哦，亲爱的，我是多么不幸啊，”勃莱特说。



这句话作为章节的结尾也颇有深意。在俱乐部的时候，Brett展现出的都是轻松愉快的样子。直到她和Jake一起坐上出租车远离了人群之后，Brett才开始表露自己的心迹。比如她一言不发地紧握住了Jake的手（Brett pressed my hand hard）, 以及最后的这句话，她突然说自己过得其实很糟糕。



至此前三章其实就是作者为后面作的铺陈，接着冰山下面的部分也会渐渐显露出来。这里面有主角们沉重的过去，以及解释了他们如何变成了今天的样子。我们一起期待吧~

### 今日彩蛋

**💧圣经故事：上帝的应许之地**



He looked a great deal as his compatriot must have looked when he saw the promised land.（他目不转睛地看着，活像他那位同胞看到上帝赐给他的土地时的神情。）



大家可能会好奇他的同胞（his compatriot）是指谁呢？我们知道Cohn是犹太人，所以这里的同胞其实是指他的犹太祖先亚伯拉罕。关于上帝给亚伯拉罕看他的所赐之地的故事出现在《圣经》的创世纪第十二章里。

亚伯拉罕是诺亚（就是那位造方舟的诺亚）的儿子闪的后裔。因为诺亚的儿子闪是蒙上帝祝福的，所以亚伯拉罕也尤其得到上帝的眷顾与指引。

创世纪十二章的开篇就是上帝对亚伯拉罕（原名是亚伯兰）的呼召：

“耶和华对亚伯兰说：‘你要离开本地、本族、父家，往我所要指示你的地去。我必叫你成为大国。我必赐福给你，叫你的名为大，你也要叫别人得福。为你祝福的，我必赐福与他；那诅咒你的，我必诅咒他。地上的万族都要因你得福。”

所以亚伯拉罕便离开迦勒底的吾珥，自己带着妻子，侄子离开部族出哈兰前往上帝应许的迦南地。这一过程中，亚伯兰一到迦南就经历了饥荒，不得不往南下到埃及；经过法老夺妻，与侄子罗得的纷争，最终分道扬镳；后又经历一连串的部落战争，逐渐发展壮大起来，最后成为迦南地区强大的部族；并且上帝和他再次立约，不仅仅带他出哈兰，进入迦南，明确地将迦南地赐给他及他的后裔为业，到这里亚伯兰才自此被称为亚伯拉罕，意思是多国的父。

但是亚伯拉罕在进入迦南地之前就死了，所以到达上帝应许之地的担子就落在他的后裔之上，由此也延伸出了《圣经》的旧约第二卷——“出埃及记”。

*迦南美地（Canaan），按照《圣经》所说，是“流奶与蜜之地”，在实际中指的是由巴勒斯坦或其位于约旦河和地中海之间的部分组成的一个古代地区。一般指西起地中海沿岸平原，东至约旦河谷，南至内格夫，北至加利利地区的一片区域。 包括今日的巴勒斯坦、约旦及埃及北部的一部分。

The taxi went up the hill, passed the lighted square, then on into the dark, still climbing, then levelled out onto a dark street behind St. Etienne du Mont (圣埃蒂安教堂),

went smoothly down the asphalt (柏油路), passed the trees and the standing bus at the Place de la Contrescarpe (康特斯卡普广场), then turned onto the cobbles of the Rue Mouffetard (穆浮塔街).

I saw her face in the lights from the open shops, then it was dark, then I saw her face clearly as we came out on the Avenue des Gobelins (戈贝林斯大道).

The street was torn up and men were working on the car-tracks by the light of acetylene (电石灯) flares.

Brett's face was white and the long line of her neck showed in the bright light of the flares.

The street was dark again and I kissed her.

Our lips were tight together and then she turned away and pressed against the corner of the seat, as far away as she could get.

Her head was down."Don't touch me," she said."Please don't touch me."

"What's the matter?""I can't stand it.""Oh, Brett."

"You mustn't. You must know. I can't stand it, that's all. Oh, darling, please understand!"

"Don't you love me?"

"Love you? I simply turn all to jelly when you touch me."

> turn to jelly 直译是“变得像果冻一样软塌塌的”，引申为“（腿或膝盖）因为害怕紧张而发软打颤”；turn to可以用feel like或be来替换，jelly也可以换成leaf, 比如：Before I went into the exam room I was shaking like a leaf.（在走进考场之前，我紧张得浑身发抖。）
>
> *再为大家补充一个包含jelly的俚语表达：like nailing jelly to the wall. “就像是要把果冻粘在墙上一样”，也就是“不可能完成的，徒劳无功的”（incredibly difficult）, 比如：Trying to have a reasonable debate with her father is like nailing jelly to the wall.（想要和她父亲讲道理是完全不可能的。）

"Isn't there anything we can do about it?"

She was sitting up now.

My arm was around her and she was leaning back against me, and we were quite calm.

She was looking into my eyes with that way she had of looking that made you wonder whether she really saw out of her own eyes.

> <font color=red>She was looking into my eyes / with that way she had of looking / that made you wonder / whether she really saw out of her own eyes.</font>

> that way she had of looking 是一个定语从句，改写后就是：she had that way of looking. have a/the way of being/doing表示“习惯性地做；做事有什么特征”（to often have a characteristic or to frequently do something）, 比如：She has a way of exaggerating when she tells stories.（她讲故事的时候总有办法说得很夸张。）

They would look on and on after every one else's eyes in the world would have stopped looking.

"And there's not a damn thing we could do," I said.

"I don't know," she said. "I don't want to go through that hell again."

"We'd better keep away from each other."

"But, darling, I have to see you. It isn't all that you know."

"No, but it always gets to be."

"That's my fault. Don't we pay for all the things we do, though?"

She had been looking into my eyes all the time.

Her eyes had different depths, sometimes they seemed perfectly flat.

Now you could see all the way into them.

"When I think of the hell I've put chaps through. I'm paying for it all now."

> chap指“家伙，小伙子”，从chapman“流动商贩”沿用而来，一般是英国人会用，而且通常是在书面语中。我们比较熟悉的男性称呼中，guy最为常用，普通关系也可以使用；fellow则有鄙夷的意思，“这大兄弟，这家伙”；buddy是关系比较好的朋友才会这么称呼；bad bod就稍微有点暧昧了，有点嗔怪的感觉，像是说“捣蛋鬼”。

"Don't talk like a fool," I said. "Besides, what happened to me is supposed to be funny. I never think about it."

"Oh, no. I'll lay you don't."

"Well, let's shut up about it."

"I laughed about it too, myself, once." She wasn't looking at me.

"A friend of my brother's came home that way from Mons (蒙斯，比利时西南部的一座古城). It seemed like a hell of a joke. Chaps never know anything, do they?"

"No," I said. "Nobody ever knows anything."

I was pretty well through with the subject.

At one time or another I had probably considered it from most of its various angles,

including the one that certain injuries or imperfections are a subject of merriment while remaining quite serious for the person possessing them.

"It's funny," I said. "It's very funny. And it's a lot of fun, too, to be in love."

"Do you think so?" her eyes looked flat again.

"I don't mean fun that way. In a way it's an enjoyable feeling."

"No," she said. "I think it's hell on earth."

"It's good to see each other."

"No. I don't think it is."

"Don't you want to?""I have to."

We were sitting now like two strangers. On the right was the Parc Montsouris (蒙特苏里公园).

The restaurant where they have the pool of live trout and where you cansit and look out over the park was closed and dark.

The driver leaned his head around.

"Where do you want to go?" I asked. Brett turned her head away.

"Oh, go to the Select."

"Cafe? Select," I told the driver. "Boulevard Montparnasse (蒙帕纳斯大街)."

We drove straight down, turning around the Lion de Belfort (贝尔福狮像) that guards the passing Montrouge (蒙鲁日, 法国南部城市) trams.

> ==tram英 [træm] 美 [træm] n. 有轨电车轨道；煤车，矿车，缆车==

Brett looked straight ahead. On the Boulevard Raspail, with the lights of Montparnasse in sight, Brett said: "Would you mind very much if I asked you to do something?"

"Don't be silly."<br>"Kiss me just once more before we get there."

When the taxi stopped I got out and paid. Brett came out putting on her hat.

She gave me her hand as she stepped down. Her hand was shaky.

> ==shaky英 [ˈʃeɪki] 美 [ˈʃeɪki] adj.（地位，信用等）动摇的；（因病、体弱等）摇晃的；虚弱的；不可靠的==

"I say, do I look too much of a mess?"

She pulled her man's felt hat down and started in for the bar.

Inside, against the bar and at tables, were most of the crowd who had been at the dance.

"Hello, you chaps," Brett said. "I'm going to have a drink."

"Oh, Brett! Brett!" the little Greek portrait-painter, who called himself a duke, and whom everybody called Zizi, pushed up to her.

"I got something fine to tell you.""Hello, Zizi," Brett said.

"I want you to meet a friend," Zizi said. A fat man came up.

"Count Mippipopolous, meet my friend Lady Ashley."

"How do you do?" said Brett.

"Well, does your Ladyship have a good time here in Paris?" asked Count Mippipopolous (), who wore an elk's tooth on his watch chain.

"Rather," said Brett."Paris is a fine town all right," said the count.

"But I guess you have pretty big doings yourself over in London."

"Oh, yes," said Brett. "Enormous."

"No," I said. "I must shove off. Seen Cohn?"

"He went home with Frances," Mrs. Braddock put in.

"Poor chap, he looks awfully down," Braddocks said.

"I dare say he is," said Mrs. Braddocks.

"I have to shove off," I said. "Good night."

I said good night to Brett at the bar.The count was buying champagne.

"Will you take a glass of wine with us, sir?" he asked.

"No. Thanks awfully. I have to go."

"Really going?" Brett asked.

"Yes," I said. "I've got a rotten headache."

"I'll see you to-morrow?"

"Come in at the office.""Hardly."

"Well, where will I see you?""Anywhere around five o'clock.”

"Make it the other side of town then." "Good. I'll be at the Crillon (即Hotel de Crillon, 克里龙酒店) at five."

"Try and be there," I said.

"Don't worry," Brett said. "I've never let you down, have I?"

"Heard from Mike?" "Letter to-day."

"Good night, sir," said the count.

I went out onto the sidewalk and walked down toward the Boulevard St. Michel (米歇尔大街), passed the tables of the Rotonde (园亭咖啡馆), still crowded

looked across the Street at the Dome, its tables running out to the edge of the pavement.

Some one waved at me from a table, I did not see who it was and went on.

### 背景知识

**💧1. Lion de Belfort 贝尔福狮像**

We drove straight down, turning around the Lion de Belfort that guards the passing Montrouge trams.（我们径直开下去，绕过守卫着开往蒙鲁日的电车的贝尔福狮像。）

这里坐落在巴黎丹费尔-罗什洛广场（Place Denfert-Rochereau）的贝尔福狮像并不是“真身”，它其实是一个缩小版（a reduction of the original one）, 原像落在贝尔福镇（the town of Belfort）.

那么为什么这里会放置贝尔福狮像呢？因为这个广场的名字其实就是为了纪念普法战争中一位功勋卓著的将军Pierre Denfert-Rochereau, 当时他带领军队在贝尔福镇守防御。

（丹费尔-罗什洛广场上的贝尔福狮像）

坐落在贝尔福镇的这座狮像是由雕塑家Frédéric Bartholdi设计的，他的雕像作品还有举世闻名的自由女神像（the Statue of Liberty）.

整个雕塑完成于1880年，而且全部都是由红砂岩（red sandstone）制成的。我们刚刚提到在巴黎的那一尊是缩小版，那么原版有多呢？大概是22米长，11米高，可谓是傲然俯视整个小镇了。

贝尔福狮像代表着法兰西人民在“贝尔福之围”（the Siege of Belfort）中长达103天的对普鲁士袭击的英勇抵抗（the heroic French resistance against the Prussian assault）. 

当时整个贝尔福镇只有1万7千个人（军队仅有3500人），而普鲁士军队则有4万人，因此突围的胜利也成为一段辉煌的历史。这座雕塑便用来纪念人民的坚强意志和对自由的热爱。

**💧2. Hôtel de Crillon 克利翁酒店**

"Make it the other side of town then." "Good. I'll be at the Crillon at five." "Try and be there," I said. "Don't worry," Brett said. "I've never let you down, have I?" （“那就在对岸找个地方吧。” “好的。五点钟我在克里龙。” “一言为定，可别失约。” 我说。“放心吧，”勃莱特说，“我什么时候哄过你？”）

Brett和Jake约在了克里翁酒店见面。这座酒店就坐落在巴黎市中心的协和广场（Place de la Concorde）上，对面是美国大使馆。它在巴黎人心目中是最“巴黎”最古老最具历史文化底蕴的豪华酒店，历来是世界各国元首和各界要人首选下榻之地。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/4d9d78960d459688487d0585ab9fba5c-sz_430466.png)



这里还有个小插曲，很多人可能不知道其实在克利翁酒店的旁边，也就是协和广场店的东侧，还有另一座和它完全一模一样（completely identical）的酒店，就叫“海军酒店”（Hôtel de la Marine）. 

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/3cde71eb1d473e1dbe78adc9addf5a59-sz_174555.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)

（左侧是克利翁酒店，右侧是海军酒店）



克利翁酒店建于1758年，当时的路易十五世命令建筑师在协和广场的这个位置上建两座新古典主义风格（neoclassical）的宫殿。“海军酒店”直到2015年后一直都是法国海军的总部所在（the headquarters of the French Navy）. 

而克利翁酒店起先是租予奥蒙特公爵（Duke d’Aumont），一位著名的艺术赞助家（a famous patron of the arts）, 后来才转由克利翁家族（the Crillon family）持有所有权，直至1907年。

早在1778年，这座酒店就已经在历史舞台上占据一席之地，比如当时法国与美国缔结法美同盟条约及通商友好条约并承认美国独立就是在此；进入20世纪，促成“国际联盟”于1919年成立的所有会议都在这间酒店召开；一战期间，酒店曾被召为盟军总部；二战期间，这里是法国军队和英国军队指挥官的住所。1944 年法国解放后，酒店变成美国军事指挥官和驻巴黎外交官的使馆。

时至今日，克利翁酒店仍遗留有过去华丽时光的痕迹，比如Salon des Aigles天花板上的Wedgewood圆形陶瓷浮雕；Les Ambassadeurs餐厅的水晶吊灯与大理石地板。

克利翁酒店最广为人知的是便是每年举办的巴黎名媛成年舞会le Bal. 这个源于英国贵族社会的传统：年满十八岁的贵族少女会在指定的一天，穿上她们最漂亮的衣服，拜见女王，表示这一年中社交季节的正式开始。这些少女被称为debutantes, 也就是“初次踏入社交界的人”。

1957年，著名的高级时装品牌Jean Patou复兴了这个传统，1968年的政治动荡又终结了它，1991年恢复，并选择克利翁酒店为举办地。

### 课文理解

在出租车上，Jake和Brett沉默了很久，这里体现在开篇的一长段都在描写出租车如何在街区之间穿梭，一会在爬坡（still climbing）, 一会又开到了平路上（levelled out onto a dark street）, 沿途都是灯火通明的酒吧和通宵营业的商店。

这里也可以看作是两位主人公内心活动的写照。在Brett突然说出（Chapter 3的结尾）自己其实过得很糟糕之后，对话并没有就此展开，此刻二人心里应该都在翻江倒海。最后是Jake抓住车内光线变暗的时机，突然吻了Brett. 但Brett在反应过来后又退缩到了车座一角，并且反应很激烈（"Don't touch me," she said. "Please don't touch me."）

在Jake的追问下，Brett才说明不是因为自己不爱她，而是其他的原因（这里作者并没有完全点明，而是留待我们在之后的情节里慢慢发掘）。这里的矛盾是这本小说最令人揪心的一点，也是Jake和Brett都无法解决的困境——

💧**Clue 1**:  Jake wants Brett Ashley, but he can't "have" her.



**Evidence 1**: "Isn't there anything we can do about it?"... "And there's not a damn thing we could do," I said.

“对此咱们就一点办法都没有？”……“咱们真他妈的一点办法都没有。”

这两句话出自Jake之口。对他来说最纠结的地方在于，Brett并不是对他丧失热情了，他也依然迫切地想拥有她，可尽管两人的意志都如此强烈，事实上的障碍却是他们都无法跨越的。这里需要联想在故事开篇的时候，Jake很隐晦地说自己生了病（"I'm sick"）, 并且表示自己是在战争中受的伤。

随后两人开始讨论面对不幸的态度，Brett认为自己现在遭受的种种痛苦都是对过去恶行的补偿——



💧**Clue 2**: Brett tends to think that the suffering of misfortunes are the payment for bad behavior.



**Evidence 1**: "That's my fault. Don't we pay for all the things we do, though?"

“这是我的过错。不过，难道我们不在为我们这一切行为付出代价？”



**Evidence 2**: "When I think of the hell I've put chaps through. I'm paying for it all now."

“我想到我给很多人带来痛苦。我现在正在还这笔账呢。”

Brett认为现在的处境，都是由她自己以前的恶行带来的（从她说自己给很多人带来痛苦来看，可能是指生活上的不检点或者玩弄他人感情）。所以她和Jake要忍受虽然彼此相爱，但却无法在一起的痛苦。

但Jake似乎并不赞成她的这种观点：



**Evidence 3**: "Don't talk like a fool," I said. "Besides, what happened to me is supposed to be funny. I never think about it."

“别说傻话了，”我说。“而且，对我自己的遭遇，我总是一笑置之。我从来不去想它。”

但Jake并非真的完全能够轻松面对，比如后面他自我安慰或麻痹式的陈述：At one time or another I had probably considered it……（难点分析7对这个句子作了详细解释）；此外，正是Jake的困惑或痛苦构成了这个故事的悬念——因为无论让Brett还是Jake饱受折磨的都是，他们无法消解现实的困境。这也是本书最重要的主题之一：人的痛苦和不幸遭遇是否都是罪有应得？如果不是，那么公平该怎么定义？作为渺小的个体又要如何找到解决和面对的路径？

### 今日彩蛋

**💧英国的贵族称谓都有哪些？**

大家有没有发现除了Jake, 其他人对Brett的称呼都是Lady Brett呢？比如Cohn在邀请Brett跳舞的时候：The music started and Robert Cohn said: "Will you dance this with me, Lady Brett?"；以及Brett的一位朋友在介绍她的时候说道："Count Mippipopolous, meet my friend Lady Ashley."（Brett的全名是Brett Asheley）.

Lady在这里不只是普通表示尊敬的称谓这么简单，它代表的其实是英国的爵位头衔。以及Brett的朋友为她引荐的这个法国人，名字前面有一个Count, 这就是法国的伯爵爵位的名称（对应的英国的伯爵爵位是Earl）. 英国和法国的贵族分级和称呼稍有不同，今天的彩蛋我们就先来看一看英国是怎么划分贵族以及他们各自的称谓吧~

\1. 公爵 Duke / Duchess

英国历史上的第一个公爵是在公元1337年出现的。“公爵”是一个极其重要、极有分量的头衔，每个时代获得公爵爵位的人都屈指可数。这里的duchess，一般是指拥有自己的公爵领地或爵位的女性，或者是duke的妻子。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/75fd2b9cf73223cc259b4852510ec5ab-sz_24331.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)

（Duke of Wellington 威灵顿公爵）

普通人在面对duke/duchess时，要称他们为Your Grace；公爵跟公爵见面的时候，也就是地位一致的时候呢，就用duke/duchess来称呼（英语当中我们用address这个词表示称呼，address作动词，后面跟某个人，意思是“称呼某人，冠以某种称呼”：is properly addressed as…）

说某某公爵的时候，都要加of，比如the Duke of Norfolk（of后面接领地）。

\2. 侯爵 Marquess或Marquis / Marchioness

侯爵是社会地位仅次于公爵的贵族人群。Marquess这个单词是从法语过来的，原词与borders，具体说是英格兰、苏格兰、威尔士的边界有关。不列颠诸岛最早的侯爵是1385年出现的。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/1c24fbbac8587e7e36c7ce2a06a33398-sz_16196.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)

（Marquis de Sade 萨德侯爵）

普通人在面对侯爵的时候呢，要称呼他们为Lord/Lady（其实，在贵族当中，只有在面对公爵的时候要说Your Grace，其他的世袭贵族成为Lord），Lord/Lady后面接姓氏。在说某某侯爵的时候，基本上所有情况下都要加of，比如the Marquess of Bath（有例外：Marques Camden等，且of后面通常跟领地）。

*在英国，lord这个词还用于某些高级官员的职位前（阁下、大人、大臣），或者是称呼法官、主教等等以示尊重。

\3. 伯爵 Earl / Countess

Earl这个词是公侯伯子男五种爵位中唯一一个来源于古英语的词汇。同时，不像其他四个爵位的单词，表示男性的词语有专门的对等的女性版本，earl这个词在古英语里并没有对等的女性版本，所以用了countess这个词。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/3ca81c45ad7e43dd2493085f4fefb4d8-sz_418938.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)

（Earl Grey 格雷伯爵）

最初时伯爵多是一人管辖数郡的诸侯，在诺曼大公侵入英国后，担心其权势过重而将伯爵的封地改为一郡。这些伯爵在地方上负有对男爵、骑士的直接领导权。

在重大正式场合，伯爵穿着镶有白色毛皮边的红色丝绒外套，软帽上缝镶着三条貂皮，冠冕上有一镀金银圈，上沿饰有8个银球。

\4. 子爵 Viscount / Viscountess

这一称号源于法国，原意类似于我们说的“郡守”，子爵处于世袭贵族的第四级，最早是伯爵的副手，不过在历史上，子爵有时也会是权倾一方的诸侯。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/9f2412535fe50f3c29699318749abe3c-sz_1739274.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmhigh)

（Viscount Nelson 纳尔逊子爵）

跟前面公侯伯三种爵位不同的是，在说某某子爵的时候，Viscount这个词后面是不加of的，直接加姓氏或者封地。

另外还要注意的一点是，一个人可以同时被授予多个爵位，伯爵、侯爵、公爵同时也可能是男爵或者子爵，而他们也许会把自己较低的爵位转赠给长子和继承人意思意思。甚至公爵还有可能同时是伯爵，比如说，里士满公爵（The Duke of Richmond）的继承人就受赠头衔马奇伯爵（Earl of March）.

\5. 男爵 Baron / Baroness

Baron这个词源自古日耳曼语。在说某某男爵的时候也不需要加of，这里的规则跟前面子爵的差不多，只有在同时说姓氏和领地的时候，才说Baron某某of某地（Baron Trevor of Bromham）.

（Baron Cavendish of Hardwicke 哈德威克的卡文迪许男爵）

男爵是五等贵族阶级里的最后一等。英国的男爵出现于11世纪，到12世纪初国王把大部分的世俗贵族都被封为男爵。其中少数与王室关系密、封地较多者又被称做“大男爵”，其地位在伯爵和男爵之间。后来，大男爵中的显赫者升为伯爵，其余也就慢慢变为普通男爵。

正因当时男爵在世俗贵族中占了很高比例，以至于“男爵”一词长期作为贵族的集合名词使用。1387年至今，男爵的人数始终是最多的。

\6. 其他爵位

其实在公侯伯子男后面，还有两种爵位：Baronet（准男爵）和Knight（骑士），但都不属于peerage，就是说不是贵族。准男爵Baronet是英国最低的世袭爵位。至于Knight，拥有这个头衔的人，一般是用Sir来称呼的。

以上提到的都属于世袭爵位，而与世袭贵族相对的就是终身贵族，不存在继承一说。不过他们的孩子表面上还是能够像世袭贵族家的小孩那样的，可以用the Honourable这种称谓，但实际上并不能继承爵位。

历史上，英国退休的首相都会获封爵位，传统上是伯爵爵位，然后进上议院。当然也有一些首相是在当上首相之前就有爵位的，那么等退休的时候可能爵位会晋升。但是，丘吉尔很不一样。当时他获封Dukedom of Dover（多佛公爵），但他没有接受。著名的Iron Lady撒切尔夫人则是获封男爵（life peerage，终身爵位）。

There was a light in the concierge's room and I knocked on the door and she gave me my mail.

> ==concierge英 [ˈkɒnsieəʒ] 美 [kɔ:nˈsjerz] n. 看门人，门房==

I wished her good night and went up-stairs. There were two letters and some papers.

I looked at them under the gas-light in the dining-room.

The letters were from the States.

One was a bank statement. It showed a balance of $2432.60.

I got out my check-book and deducted four checks drawn since the first of the month, and discovered I had a balance of $1832.60.

> ==deduct英 [dɪˈdʌkt] 美 [dɪˈdʌkt] vt. 演绎；扣除，减去==

I wrote this on the back of the statement.

The other letter was a wedding announcement.

Mr. and Mrs. Aloysius Kirby announce the marriage of their daughter Katherine--I knew neither the girl nor the man she was marrying.

They must be circularizing the town.It was a funny name.

> ==circularize==
>
> vt. 通知；传阅；分发传单
>
> 原文：They must be circularizing the town.
>
> 他们想必是整个镇都发了结婚请柬。
>
> 💧circular作为形容词表示“流通的”，所以circularize就是“使流通，传阅”，相当于send around. 比如：He is circularizing (sending around) an appeal for funds.
>
> 他正在四处进行募资。

I felt Sure I could remember anybody with a name like Aloysius.

It was a good Catholic name. There was a crest on the announcement.

Like Zizi the Greek duke. And that count.

The count was funny. Brett had a title, too.

Lady Ashley. To hell with Brett. To hell with you, Lady Ashley.

I lit the lamp beside the bed, turned off the gas, and opened the wide windows.

The bed was far back from the windows, and I sat with the windows open and undressed by the bed.

Outside a night train, running on the street-car tracks, went by carrying vegetables to the markets.

They were noisy at night when you could not sleep.

Undressing, I looked at myself in the mirror of the big armoire beside the bed.

That was a typically French way to furnish a room.

Practical, too, I suppose. Of all the ways to be wounded.

I suppose it was funny. I put on my pajamas and got into bed.

I had the two bull-fight papers, and I took their wrappers off.

One was orange. The other yellow.

They would both have the same news, so whichever I read first would spoil the other.

Le Toril was the better paper, so I started to read it. I read it all the way through, including the Petite Correspondance and the Cornigrams.

> <font color=red>I read it all the way through, including thePetite Correspondance and the Cornigrams.</font>
>
> 我从头到尾看了一遍，包括读者小信箱栏和斗牛节目单。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①all the way through 表示“从头到尾”，through本身有“从一端到另一端”的意思，这里就是from the first page to the last page. through还可以搭配时间，比如：He slept right through the day.（他睡了一整天。）
>
> ②Petite Correspondance “读者小信箱栏”；petite原义是形容“（女子）娇小可爱的”，这里可以理解为“短小的”（short）; correspondance也就是“信函”，或者指“通信联系”，比如be in correspondance with sb表示“和某人保持通信”。
>
> ③Cornigrams 是一个捏造的词，可以猜测是关于斗牛比赛的节目单（-gram这个后缀表示“清单、列表”）。

I blew out the lamp. Perhaps I would be able to sleep.

My head started to work. The old grievance.

>
> 原文：My head started to work. The old grievance.
>
> 我开始胡思乱想起来。想起这一块多年的心病。
>
> 💧grievance和grief都是由动词grieve延伸出来的，但意思稍有不同。grievance侧重指“（因为不平而产生的）委屈或抱怨”，比如：There must be an opportunity for both sides to air theirgrievances.
>
> 一定要有一个机会让双方都说出心中的不满。
>
> 💧而grief表示“悲痛，悲伤”，比如：The grief she felt over Helen’s death was almost unbearable. 
>
> 她因海伦的去世而悲痛难当。

Well, it was a rotten way to be wounded and flying on a joke front like the Italian.

> <font color=red>Well, it was a rotten way / to be wounded andflying / on a joke front like the Italian.</font>

>
> ②fly 表示“逃离”其实也是一种比较正式的用法，相当于flee. 比如：By the time the police arrived, the men had flown.（警察赶到时，那些人已经逃走了。）
>
> **💧知识拓展**
>
> 这里形容意大利前线为a joke front其实是有历史缘由的。作为一战中的重要参战国之一，意大利是所有列强中最不讲信用的一个。当时在战前欧洲分裂为英法俄为首的协约国和以德奥意为首的同盟国。意大利作为同盟国的一员，与德国、奥匈帝国签订了互相援助的三国同盟条约。但一战开战还没一年，意大利就投敌叛变，加入了协约国的一方，狠狠的坑了盟友一把。所以Jake才说从意大利前线上因为受伤退下来实在不是什么光荣的事情。

In the Italian hospital we were going to form a society.

It had a funny name in Italian. I wonder what became of the others, the Italians.

That was in the Ospedale Maggiore in Milano (米兰总医院), Padiglione Ponte (庞蒂病房).

The next building was the Padiglione Zonda (宗达病房). There was a statue of Ponte, or maybe it was Zonda.

That was where the liaison colonel (上校联络官) came to visit me.

> ==liaison英 [liˈeɪzn] 美 [liˈeɪzɑ:n] n. 联络，联络人==
>
> ==colonel英 [ˈkɜ:nl] 美 [ˈkɜ:rnl] n. 上校==

That was funny. That was about the first funny thing.

I was all bandaged up. But they had told him about it.

Then he made that wonderful speech: "You, a foreigner, an Englishman" (any foreigner was an Englishman) "have given more than your life."

What a speech! I would like to have it illuminated to hang in the office.

> <font color=red>What a speech! I would like to have it illuminated / to hang in the office.</font>

> ①have it illuminated 也就是to illuminate it. illuminate在这里不是常见的“照亮，阐明”的意思，而是指“镶字，镀金或镀银”（to decorate (a manuscript or book) with colors and gold or silver）.
>
> ②hang 在这里表示“挂在墙上”是用主动语态，比如：There was a family photograph hanging on the wall.（墙上挂着一幅全家福。）

He never laughed. He was putting himself in my place, I guess.

"Che mala fortuna! Che mala fortuna! ([意大利语] 真不幸、真不幸啊！)" I never used to realize it, I guess.

I try and play it along and just not make trouble for people.

> 也可以指“暂时忍受”（to put up with temporarily）, 比如：I know that school can be boring sometimes, but you just need to play along for a while until you can study things that really interest you.（我知道上学有时候确实很无聊，但在学到感兴趣的东西之前，暂且就先忍受着吧。）
>
> *这里Jake受到来看望他的上校联络官的触动（他似乎是真切地为Jake的受伤感到悲痛），所以觉得自己应该装作以平常心对待，这样避免让别人过度为他感到闹心。

Probably I never would have had any trouble if I hadn't run into Brett when they shipped me to England.

I suppose she only wanted what she couldn't have.

Well, people were that way. To hell with people.

The Catholic Church had an awfully good way of handling all that.

Good advice, anyway. Not to think about it.

Oh, it was swell advice. Try and take it sometime. Try and take it.

> <font color=red>Good advice, anyway. Not to think about it. Oh, it was swell advice. Try and take it sometime. Try and take it.</font>

> ①swell advice “忠言，金玉良言”；swell在这里表示“极好的，一流的”，是已经过时的用法，比如：You look swell!（你看上去漂亮极了！）
>
> *这里的忠言就是上一句的“Not to think about it.” 指天主教的信仰在面对人总是想得到自己得不到的东西时，采取的策略就是回避、克制自己的念头。Jake在这里是讽刺的语气，他并不认同这种观念。
>
> ②take it “忍受（痛苦）”（to endure or tolerate sth unpleasant or harsh）, 比如：Military training is grueling, and some people just can't take it.（军事训练很折磨人 ，有些人就是受不了而已。）
>
> *take it 还有一个意思是指“（在某种程度上）理解，明白”（to understand in a certain way）, 比如：I take it the gig was canceled, judging from the sound of that phone call.（从那通电话的内容来看，听起来似乎是演奏会取消了。）

I lay awake thinking and my mind jumping around.

Then I couldn't keep away from it, and I started to think about Brett and all the rest of it went away.

I was thinking about Brett and my mind stopped jumping around and started to go in sort of smooth waves.

Then all of a sudden I started to cry.

Then after a while it was better and I lay in bed and listened to the heavy trams go by and way down the street, and then I went to sleep.

I woke up. There was a row going on outside.

I listened and I thought I recognized a voice.

I put on a dressing-gown and went to the door. The concierge was talking down-stairs.

She was very angry. I heard my name and called down the stairs.

"Is that you, Monsieur Barnes?" the concierge called.

"Yes. It's me."

"There's a species of woman here who's waked the whole street up.

What kind of a dirty business at this time of night! She says she must see you. I've told her you're asleep."

> <font color=red>"There's a species of woman here who's waked the whole street up. What kind of a dirty business at this time of night!"</font>

>
> **💧表达精讲**

> ①a species of woman “不知道什么名堂的女人”；species本义是指“物种”，这里表示“某种类型（的人）”（a kind, variety, or type）, 比如："No species of performing artist is as self-critical as a dancer" — Susan Sontag（“所有的艺术家里，没有像舞蹈家那样严于律己的了。” — 苏珊·桑塔格）
>
> ②dirty 在这里指“不道德的，令人鄙夷的”（distasteful），比如：What a dirty trick!（多么卑鄙的伎俩！）

Then I heard Brett's voice. Half asleep I had been sure it was Georgette.

I don't know why. She could not have known my address.

"Will you send her up, please?"

Brett came up the stairs. I saw she was quite drunk.

"Silly thing to do," she said. "Make an awful row. I say, you weren't asleep, were you?"

"What did you think I was doing?"

"Don't know. What time is it?"

I looked at the clock. It was half-past four.

"Had no idea what hour it was," Brett said. "I say, can a chap sit down? Don't be cross, darling. Just left the count. He brought me here."

"What's he like?" I was getting brandy and soda and glasses.

"Just a little," said Brett. "Don't try and make me drunk. The count? Oh, rather. He's quite one of us."

"Is he a count?"<br>"Here's how. I rather think so, you know. Deservesto be, anyhow.

Knows hell's own amount about people. Don't know where he got it all. Owns a chain of sweetshops in the States."

> <font color=red>"Knows hell's own amount about people."</font>
>
> “多懂得人情世故啊。”
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> 这句话形容的是Brett的朋友给她介绍的那位法国伯爵（Count Mippipopolous）. amount在这里不是指数量quantity, 它在英英词典中有这样一个义项：the full effect, value, or significance. 所以amount about people可以理解为the important knowledge of people or humanity that should be known when you are dealing with people（在和人打交道的时候需要了解的相处之道或是对人性的洞察）。

She sipped at her glass.<br>"Think he called it a chain. Something like that. Linked them all up.

Told me a little about it. Damned interesting. He's one of us, though. Oh, quite. No doubt. One can always tell."

She took another drink."How do I buck on about all this? You don't mind, do you? He's putting up for Zizi, you know."

> <font color=red>"He's putting up for Zizi, you know."</font>
>
> “你知道的，他正在资助齐齐。”
>
> **💧表达精讲**

> put up 表示“提供（资助）”，常见的搭配是put up sth (money) for sb. 比如：The state agreed to put up \$69,000 to start his company.（国家同意出资​$69000创办他的公司。）
>
> *除了金钱上的帮助，put up还可以指“提供（食宿）”，比如： I wanted to know if she could put me up for a few days.（我想知道她能否让我留宿几天。） 

"Is Zizi really a duke, too?""I shouldn't wonder. Greek, you know. Rotten painter. I rather liked the count."

"Where did you go with him?"

"Oh, everywhere. He just brought me here now. Offered me ten thousand dollars to go to Biarritz (比亚里茨，法国西南端靠近西班牙的一座城市)with him. How much is that in pounds?"

"Around two thousand.""Lot of money. I told him I couldn't do it. He was awfully nice about it. Told him I knew too many people in Biarritz."

Brett laughed."I say, you are slow on the up-take," she said. I had only sipped my brandy and soda. I took a long drink.

> <font color=red>"I say, you are slow on the up-take," she said.</font>
>
> “咳，你反应太迟钝了，”她说道。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> uptake 本义是指“摄取量”（the amount of sth that is to take in or absorb）, 进而引申为“（对事物的）理解”（the understandings of things）. 所以quick/slow on the uptake就是指“理解/反应快或慢”，比如：She is not an intellectual, but is quick on the uptake.（她不是一个智力超群的人，但是理解事物却很快。） 

"That's better. Very funny," Brett said. "Then he wanted me to go to Cannes (戛纳，法国东南部的旅游胜地) with him.

Told him I knew too many people in Cannes. Monte Carlo (蒙特卡罗，摩纳哥著名的赌城). Told him I knew too many people in Monte Carlo. Told him I knew too many people everywhere. Quite true, too. So I asked him to bring me here."

She looked at me, her hand on the table, her glass raised. "Don't look like that," she said.

"Told him I was in love with you. True, too. Don't look like that. He was damn nice about it. Wants to drive us out to dinner to-morrow night. Like to go?"

"Why not?""I'd better go now.""Why?"

"Just wanted to see you. Damned silly idea. Want to get dressed and come down? He's got the car just up the Street."

"The count?""Himself. And a chauffeur in livery. Going to drive me around and have breakfast in the Bois ([法语]森林，这里指巴黎西郊的布洛涅森林).Hampers. Got it all at Zelli's (柴利饭店). Dozen bottles of Mumms (玛姆香槟，产自德国的烈性酒). Tempt you?"

"I have to work in the morning," I said. "I'm too far behind you now to catch up and be any fun."

"Don't be an ass.""Can't do it.""Right. Send him a tender message?""Anything. Absolutely."

"Good night, darling.""Don't be sentimental.""You make me ill."

We kissed good night and Brett shivered. "I'd better go," she said. "Good night, darling."

"You don't have to go.""Yes."

We kissed again on the stairs and as I called for the cordon the concierge muttered something behind her door.

I went back upstairs and from the open window watched Brett walking up the street to the big limousine drawn up to the curb under the arc-light.

She got in and it started off. I turned around. On the table was an empty glass and a glass half-full of brandy and soda.

I took them both out to the kitchen and poured the half-full glass down the sink.

I turned off the gas in the dining-room, kicked off my slippers sitting on the bed, and got into bed.

This was Brett, that I had felt like crying about.

Then I thought of her walking up the street and stepping into the car, as I had last seen her, and of course in a little while I felt like hell again.

It is awfully easy to be hard-boiled about everything in the daytime, but at night it is another thing.

> <font color=red>It is awfully easy to be hard-boiled about everything in the daytime, but at night it is another thing.</font>
>
> 在白天，我极容易就可以对什么都不动感情，但是一到夜里，就是另一码事了。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①awfully easy “极为容易”；awfully在这里单纯强调“非常”，没有“糟糕”这一层含义，和terribly类似。
>
> ②hard-boiled 字面上是指“（鸡蛋）煮得老硬的”（半熟或溏心的就是soft-boiled啦~），引申为“不动感情的，铁石心肠的”（unsentimental, tough）, hard-headed或hard-hearted也可以形容这类非常强悍的人。

### 背景知识

**💧Literature of Stream of Consciousness** 

**意识流文学**

今天要为大家介绍的是文学界里让很多人都“高山仰止”的一种写作手法——意识流（Stream of Consciousness）. 虽然海明威不是最典型的意识流作家，但是我们现在读的《太阳照常升起》里就有很多Jake的心理活动片段采用了这种描写手法（所以感觉情节很跳跃以及有不明所以的时候都是很正常的~）

意识流文学泛指注重描绘人物意识流动状态的文学作品，既包括清醒的意识，更包括无意识、梦幻意识和语言前意识。“意识流”一词源自心理学词汇，由美国机能主义心理学家先驱詹姆斯创造（coined by psychologist William James）, 用来表示意识的流动特性：个体的经验意识是一个统一的整体，但是意识的内容是不断变化的，从来不会静止不动。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/ec250d9af2ca0b407a50b4f74008d118-sz_33594.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



在表现手法上，意识流作家较多地采用了内心独白（interior monologue）、时序颠倒（reverse chronological order）的叙述方法；自由联想（free imagination）（包括事实与梦幻、现实与回忆的相互交织，来回流动）；类似蒙太奇（Montage）的衔接技巧，语言形式的离奇（unusual syntax）的试验以及舍弃标点符号（omission of punctuations）等等。

那么以意识流写作闻名的作家有哪些呢？



\1. Marcel Proust 马赛尔·普鲁斯特

他的著名长篇小说《追忆似水年华》（*Remembrance of Things Past*）（1913－1927）是意识流小说的奠基作。小说以叙述者“我”追忆往事为主线，插入了“我”的所见所闻。按人物思想流动的心理时间来结构作品，着意描写人物意识流程。以人物主观感受代替传统小说中人物命运、矛盾冲突的主导地位。作品突出带有“内审性”特征，被认为是“革新了题材与写作技巧的新型小说”。

\2. William Faulkner 威廉·福克纳

福克纳的代表作《喧哗与骚动》（*The Sound and the Fury*）（1929）和《追忆逝水年华》、《尤利西斯》并称为意识流小说的三大杰作。小说采用多角度的叙述手法讲述三兄弟与他们的姐妹凯蒂母女有关的故事，深入人物的潜意识，描写人物内心世界和病态心理。

\3. Virginia Woolf 弗吉尼亚·伍尔夫

伍尔夫的第一部意识流小说《墙上的斑点》（*The Mark on the Wall*）发表于1919年。她的小说不注重表现事件、人物之间的关系，而把创作重心放在对人物思想感情流程的再现上，讲究环境和景物描写的印象效果。她的文笔富于音乐性，并运用音乐上的“曲式学”结构作品，给读者以美感。

其他著名的作品比如《达洛维夫人》（*Mrs. Dalloway*）(1925)、《到灯塔去》（*To the Lighthouse*）（1927）也非常出色。《达洛维夫人》表现的是达洛维夫人在家庭晚会上重见旧日恋人彼德并得知附近一患精神病的男子自杀后二人意识的跳跃纷呈。

*这里再为大家推荐一部电影《时时刻刻》（*The Hours*）: 里面的三个主角通过《达洛维夫人》被联系在了一起，虽然身处不同时空，经历迥异，但人物精神内核都是女性的抗争和自由的表达。

意识流作品虽然在阅读上存在一定的门槛，但它最吸引人的地方也在于读者需要调动一定的想象和共情能力来理解情节，所以往往对人物的遭遇和处境有更深刻的体会~

### 课文理解

Jake回到家后并没有马上入睡，他的旧“伤疤”又被揭开，比如再次回想起自己受伤后在医院的经历。有两个隐晦的细节其实就印证了我们在前面所做的猜测——

💧**Clue 1**:  The wound is the kind that renders Jake unable to have sex.



**Evidence 1**: Of all the ways to be wounded. I suppose it was funny.

偏偏在那个地方受了伤。我看这是会惹人好笑的。



**Evidence 2**: Then he made that wonderful speech: "You, a foreigner, an Englishman" (any foreigner was an Englishman) "have given more than your life."

他就做了一番了不起的演说：“你，一个外国人，一个英国人（任何外国人在他看来都是英国人）做出了比牺牲生命更大的贡献。”



一方面要面对别人煞有介事的关怀（比如这位上校联络员对他说的这番话其实让Jake觉得很可笑），所以Jake只好自己也装作云淡风轻的样子来减轻痛苦（I try and play it along and just not make trouble for people）. 但另一方面，他又偏偏在这之后遇到了Brett（Probably I never would have had any trouble if I hadn't run into Brett when they shipped me to England）. 而他无法令Brett得到她想要的满足就成了Jake的一大心结（I suppose she only wanted what she couldn't have）, 这也成为了长久以来让他倍感挫败和无望的源头。



在今天的故事里，还有另外一个人物插入到了Jake和Brett的感情当中，也就是在酒吧的时候Brett的朋友Zizi为她介绍的一位法国的伯爵（Count Mippipopolous）, 半夜里开车把Brett送到Jake家楼底下的也是这个伯爵。他追求Brett的方式当然非常蛮横自我（"Offered me ten thousand dollars to go to Biarritz with him." "Then he wanted me to go to Cannes with him." — Brett）, 但在某种程度上，他和Jake截然不同，而且他和Brett更像是属于同一类人——



💧**Clue 2**: The Count is also in love with Brett but more of her kind.



**Evidence 1**: "Think he called it a chain. Something like that. Linked them all up. Told me a little about it. Damned interesting. He's one of us, though. Oh, quite. No doubt. One can always tell."

“我想他是把它们叫作连锁店。反正是类似的称呼。把一家家店都‘串起来’。给我讲了一点，太有趣了。不过他跟我们经历一样。啊，说真的。毫无疑问，这总是错不了的。”



*"He's one of us, though"是指这位伯爵曾经也参加过一战（Jake是战线士兵，而Brett是当时Jake受伤后所住的医院的护士，这个在后面的情节会提及。）



**Evidence 2**: "Himself. And a chauffeur in livery. Going to drive me around and have breakfast in the Bois. Hampers. Got it all at Zelli's. Dozen bottles of Mumms. Tempt you?"

“就他本人，还有一个穿着制服的司机。要带我兜一圈，然后到布洛涅森林去吃早饭。有几篮酒食，全是从柴利饭店弄得。成打的玛姆香槟。有诱惑力吧？”



伯爵做的是糖果店连锁生意，“连锁商店”这种形式在当时并不常见，所以Brett觉得很新颖有趣。而且她特别强调了"He's one of us, though", 说明伯爵和当时从一战退下来的其他年轻人不同，他自在地放纵在享乐里，生活依然斑斓多彩，而不是像Jake这样的缺乏刺激并且终日觉得苦闷。



最后当Brett邀请Jake一起加入的时候，Jake以自己体力欠佳并且第二天还要上班为由拒绝了（"I have to work in the morning," I said. "I'm too far behind you now to catch up and be any fun."）但最后从窗口目睹Brett上了伯爵的车的时候，Jake却是心痛不已，就跟上一次看着Brett离去一样（This was Brett, that I had felt like crying about. Then I thought of her walking up the street and stepping into the car, as I had last seen her, and of course in a little while I felt like hell again）.



面对这样不甘寂寞并且追求刺激的Brett，Jake深感无力，并且这种挫败感可能要比他身体上受的伤害更折磨人，接下来的故事就会围绕着他到底要如何去消解这种矛盾展开。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧【心理小百科】可能潜伏在我们身边的PTSD**



今天的内容里描写了一段Jake在入睡前意识突然非常混乱的经历：



I lay awake thinking and my mind jumping around. Then I couldn't keep away from it, and I started to think about Brett and all the rest of it went away. I was thinking about Brett and my mind stopped jumping around and started to go in sort of smooth waves. Then all of a sudden I started to cry. Then after a while it was better and I lay in bed and listened to the heavy trams go by and way down the street, and then I went to sleep.



其实这种对于过去痛苦记忆的闪回（flashbacks）以及突然情绪崩溃大哭（breakdown）都属于创伤后的应激反应障碍（Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, PTSD）的病症。 



PTSD的发生与很多因素相关联，这些因素主要分为家庭、社会心理因素（如性别、年龄、种族、婚姻状况、经济状况、社会地位、工作状况、受教育水平、应激性生活事件、个性特征、防御方式、童年期创伤、家庭暴力、战争、社会支持等）和生物学因素（如遗传因素、神经内分泌因素、神经生化因素等）。



这种情绪障碍最早源于一战，被称作“炮弹休克症”（Shell Shock）. 很多战士会不断闪回在战场上的血腥场面，虽然外在表现可能很正常，但内心却不断陷入在惨烈的场景当中。接着便会选择酗酒来麻醉自己，后半生都生活在战争的阴影里。



但当时医学界基于常识认为这种伤害是“震荡”的结果，也就是颅内大脑受到严重震荡，于是“炮弹休克”被认为是一种生理伤害，所有遭受“炮弹休克”的士兵在制服上都能有一条“伤兵带”，他们会被遣散并接受战争受伤赔偿。 还有误将其归结为“性格软弱”（weak character）和“意志不坚”（lack of moral fiber）的。但是随着战争深入，越来越多医学观点开始认为“炮弹休克”属于神经性疾病。



PTSD一般的临床表现会有：



1）反复体验创伤（reliving the trauma, "flashbacks"）

2）回避（avoidance）

3）高度警觉和过度反应（being highly alarmed and overreacting）

4）消极的认知和情绪（negative thinking and mood）



PTSD一般在精神创伤性事件发生后数天至6个月内发病，病程至少持续1个月以上，可长达数月或数年，个别甚至达数十年之久。而患者除了服用药物以外，还需要进行长期的心理治疗，包括认知行为治疗、催眠治疗等。



比如BBC拍摄的《神探夏洛克》里的华生医生，他从阿富汗战场上担任军医回国后就遭受了PTSD的折磨，所以第一季的开场就是他进行心理咨询的镜头。在后面的情节中，比如Mary去世，都导致了他PTSD的复发，包括做噩梦、盗汗等等。



这里为大家推荐两部电影，里面都涉及了从战场上退下来的战士遭受PTSD的情节——



一部是《敦刻尔克》：当船长道森先生在前往敦刻尔克的途中营救一位士兵时，那位被救上游艇的士兵神色十分恐惧、不愿意接受别人的帮助、易激惹，还和道森的助手发生了“肢体冲突”，结果助手因意外丧命。



另一部则是《比利·林恩的中场战事》：电影中比利和他所在的B班在橄榄球赛上和保安大打出手以及勒住说话不干净的球迷的脖子等暴力动作，其实都是PTSD的应激反应之一——过度警觉、产生不计后果的毁灭行为。



实际上，不是每个遭遇创伤的人都会发展成持续或慢性的PTSD，但同时也不是只有遭受过严重危险性事件（比如地震、战争）的人才会患上PTSD。任何生活中突发的刺激性事件（按照当事人的感觉和承受程度来衡量），比如爱人的突然死亡（unexpected death of a loved one）, 遭受性侵（sexual assault）, 或者是罹患致命的疾病（life-threatening illness）, 以及失恋和欺凌都会引起PTSD.



对于PTSD人群来说，创伤在时间流逝中会成为他们生活的一部分，除了应激反应，甚至还会带来人格上的伤疤，所以也格外需要身边的亲友给予足够的支持和关爱。

In the morning I walked down the Boulevard to the Rue Soufflot (索弗洛路，由卢森堡公园通向先贤祠)for coffee and brioche (奶油蛋卷).

It was a fine morning.

The horse-chestnut trees in the Luxembourg gardens (卢森堡公园) were in bloom.

>
> 1990年经济繁荣的国家并不多，尤其是像澳大利亚这样的黄金出口国。

There was the pleasant early-morning feeling of a hot day.

I read the papers with the coffee and then smoked a cigarette.

The flower-women were coming up from the market and arranging their daily stock.

Students went by going up to the law school, or down to the Sorbonne (索邦大学).

The Boulevard was busy with trams and people going to work.

I got on an S bus and rode down to the Madeleine (玛德琳教堂), standing on the back platform.

From the Madeleine I walked along the Boulevard des Capucines (卡布辛大街) to the Opéra, and up to my office.

I passed the man with the jumping frogs and the man with the boxer toys.

I stepped aside to avoid walking into the thread with which his girl assistant manipulated the boxers.

She was standing looking away, the thread in her folded hands.

The man was urging two tourists to buy.

Three more tourists had stopped and were watching.

I walked on behind a man who was pushing a roller that printed the name CINZANO (沁扎诺牌苦艾酒) on the sidewalk in damp letters.

All along people were going to work.

It felt pleasant to be going to work.

I walked across the avenue and turned in to my office.

Up-stairs in the office I read the French morning papers, smoked, and then sat at the typewriter and got off a good morning's work.

At eleven o'clock I went over to the Quai d'Orsay (原指奥赛码头，这里代指法国外交部)in a taxi and went in and sat with about a dozen correspondents, while the foreign-office mouthpiece, a young Nouvelle Revue Francaise diplomat in hornrimmed spectacles, talked and answered questions for half an hour.

The President of the Council was in Lyons (里昂) making a speech, or, rather he was on his way back.

Several people asked questions to hear themselves talk and there were a couple of questions asked by news service men who wanted to know the answers.

There was no news. I shared a taxi back from the Quai d'Orsay with Woolsey and Krum.

"What do you do nights, Jake?" asked Krum. "I never see you around."

"Oh, I'm over in the Quarter."

"I'm coming over some night. The Dingo. That's the great place, isn't it?"

"Yes. That, or this new dive, the Select."

"I've meant to get over," said Krum. "You know how it is, though, with a wife and kids."

"Playing any tennis?" Woolsey asked.

"Well, no," said Krum. "I can't say I've played any this year. I've tried to get away, but Sundays it's always rained, and the courts are so damned crowded."

"The Englishmen all have Saturday off," Woolsey said.

"Lucky beggars," said Krum.

"Well, I'll tell you. Some day I'm not going to be working for an agency. Then I'll have plenty of time to get out in the country."

"That's the thing to do. Live out in the country and have a little car."

"I've been thinking some about getting a car next year."

I banged on the glass. The chauffeur stopped.

"Here's my street," I said. "Come in and have a drink."

"Thanks, old man," Krum said.

Woolsey shook his head. "I've got to file that line he got off this morning."

I put a two-franc piece in Krum's hand.

"You're crazy, Jake," he said. "This is on me."

"It's all on the office, anyway."

"Nope. I want to get it."I waved good-by.

Krum put his head out."See you at the lunch on Wednesday."

"You bet."I went to the office in the elevator.

Robert Cohn was waiting for me. "Hello, Jake," he said. "Going out to lunch?"

"Yes. Let me see if there is anything new."

"Where will we eat?""Anywhere."

I was looking over my desk. "Where do you want to eat?"

"How about Wetzel's? They've got good hors d'oeuvres (冷盘)."

> ==hors d'oeuvres英 [ˌɔ: ˈdɜ:v] 美 [ˌɔ:r ˈdɜ:rv] n. 拼盘；餐前点心==

In the restaurant we ordered hors d'oeuvres and beer.

The sommelier brought the beer, tall, beaded on the outside of the stems, and cold.

There were a dozen different dishes of hors d'oeuvres.

"Have any fun last night?" I asked.

"No. I don't think so.""How's the writing going?"

"Rotten. I can't get this second book going."

"That happens to everybody.""Oh, I'm sure of that. It gets me worried, though."

"Thought any more about going to South America?""I mean that."

"Well, why don't you start off?""Frances."

"Well," I said, "take her with you."

"What do you know about Lady Brett Ashley, Jake?"

"Her name's Lady Ashley. Brett's her own name. She's a nice girl," I said.

"She's getting a divorce and she's going to marry Mike Campbell.

He's over in Scotland now. Why?"

"She's a remarkably attractive woman." "Isn't she?"

"There's a certain quality about her, a certain fineness. She seems to be absolutely fine and straight."

"She's very nice."

"I don't know how to describe the quality," Cohn said. "I suppose it's breeding."

"You sound as though you liked her pretty well."

"I do. I shouldn't wonder if I were in love with her."

"She's a drunk," I said.

"She's in love with Mike Campbell, and she's going to marry him. He's going to be rich as hell some day."

"I don't believe she'll ever marry him."

"Why not?""I don't know. I just don't believe it. Have you known her a long time?"

"Yes," I said. "She was a V. A. D. ina hospital I was in during the war."

"She must have been just a kid then."

"She's thirty-four now."

"When did she marry Ashley?"

"During the war. Her own true love had just kicked off with the dysentery."

"You talk sort of bitter."

"Sorry. I didn't mean to. I was just trying to give you the facts."

"I don't believe she would marry anybody she didn't love."

"Well," I said. "She's done it twice."

"I don't believe it."

"Well," I said, "don't ask me a lot of fool questions if you don't like the answers."

"I didn't ask you that.""You asked me what I knew about Brett Ashley."

"I didn't ask you to insult her.""Oh, go to hell."

He stood up from the table his face white, and stood there white and angry behind the little plates of horsd'ceuvres.

"Sit down," I said. "Don't be a fool."

"You've got to take that back.""Oh, cut out the prep-school stuff."

"Take it back.""Sure. Anything. I never heard of Brett Ashley. How's that?"

"No. Not that. About me going to hell."

"Oh, don't go to hell," I said. "Stick around. We're just starting lunch."

Cohn smiled again and sat down.He seemed glad to sit down.

What the hell would he have done if he hadn't sat down?

"You say such damned insulting things, Jake."

"I'm sorry. I've got a nasty tongue. I never mean it when I say nasty things."

"I know it," Cohn said. "You're really about the best friend I have, Jake."

God help you, I thought. "Forget what I said," I said out loud. "I'm sorry."

"It's all right. It's fine. I was just sore for a minute."

"Good. Let's get something else to eat."

After we finished the lunch we walked up to the Café de la Paix (和平咖啡馆) and had coffee.

I could feel Cohn wanted to bring up Brett again, but I held him off it.

### 背景知识

**💧V.A.D. Voluntary Aid Detachment**

**（英国）志愿救护队**

"Yes," I said. "She was a V. A. D. in a hospital I was in during the war."

Jake向Cohn透露，他和Brett在医院认识，当时的Brett在那担任V. A. D. 这个身份的全称是Valuntary Aid Detachment, 即“志愿救护队”（detachment有“分遣队，支队”的意思）.

这个救护队并不是属于国际组织的，而是特指在英国本土或是其他英属领地上的救护队，在1909年由英国红十字会（British Red Cross）和圣约翰骑士团（Order of St John）共同创立的。到1914年夏天，VAD的总人数已经都达到7万4千人，其中有三分之二都是女性。

一战爆发后，VAD积极加入到后勤医疗的救护中。但是一开始大部分的志愿者都来自中层或上层阶级，难以适应战场环境的艰苦和传统的医院制度的约束（unaccustomed to hardship and traditional hospital discipline）, 所以大部分人都只是在英国本土的医院从事志愿活动。并且由于专业知识和技能的缺乏（due to the lack of advanced knowledge and skills），军队医疗也不接受VAD的志愿者上前线服务。

起初VAD和军队医院难以相融，但随着战争的深入（as the war stretched on）, 这些志愿者们不断在学习医疗救护知识，并且也有相当一部分接受过护士训练的人加入到VAD中，所以二者关系逐渐缓和。在4年中，总计有3万8千名志愿者在军队中担任救护车司机以及负责炊事工作。

大家可能不知道有“侦探小说女王”之称的阿加莎·克里斯蒂（Agatha Christie）也曾经是VAD的一员。阿加莎出身于富有的中产阶级家庭，从小接受维多利亚式的教育，所以当她决定在一战爆发后加入VAD时一度令朋友非常惊讶。

起初，她在英格兰德文郡的海滨小镇托基（Torquay）做志愿护士。许多运送战地伤员的船只在此停靠。但这份工作并不轻松，她的传记作家珍妮特·摩根这样写道： “这份工作艰难而辛苦。工作场地一片混乱，臭气熏天。她后来在小说《巨人的面包》中也有所记述。”

她的研究专家约翰·柯伦博士也这样说道： “最初她是做护士，但由于一战战况激烈，很多伤员的伤口触目惊心。所以当她有机会转到药房工作时，她就欣然接受了。我认为在个人层面上，这样一个年轻女子，从小受维多利亚式教育，娇生惯养，突然看到那些断了胳膊或腿、失去眼睛的伤员，真的很难应对。”

但这段经历对她来说还有无比宝贵的一点，她在参加救护的过程中学习了不少药剂学的知识，因此在1917年参加药剂师协会的考试时顺利通过，并开始在托基市政厅大楼内的医院药房工作。更重要的是，丰富严谨的药理学知识还帮助阿加莎在之后的侦探小说里创作出精彩绝伦的谋杀诡计，其专业性甚至连药理专家都挑不出BUG.

根据阿加莎的红十字会工作证显示，她在1914年10月至1916年12月间，无偿服务了3400个小时。到1918年9月一战结束，她的志愿服务也告一段落。她认为志愿救护员是“任何人都可以追求的，最有成就感的职业之一”。

### 课文理解

今天内容的重头戏在Jake和Cohn一起吃午饭时的对话：Cohn主动向Jake询问关于Brett的情况，并且因为对Jake和Brett的关系毫无察觉，所以毫不避讳地谈到自己对Brett的爱慕（"She's a remarkably attractive woman."）还因为觉得Jake没说Brett的好话而不满发火。

Jake对Brett的感情很矛盾，并且由于嫉妒心作祟，他一开始夸Brett是个“好女孩”（"She's very nice."）但在听到Cohn对她赞不绝口的时候 ，又开始抖露Brett的另一面，比如她酗酒（"She's a drunk" ），以及跟很多男人纠缠不清——



💧**Clue 1**:  Brett has a rich experience in romance.

**Evidence 1**: "She's in love with Mike Campbell, and she's going to marry him. He's going to be rich as hell some day."

“她爱的是迈克尔·坎贝尔，而且她就要嫁给他了。而这个迈克尔迟早会发大财的。”

**Evidence 2**: "When did she marry Ashley?" "During the war. Her own true love had just kicked off with the dysentery."

“她什么时候嫁的阿什利？” “大战期间。她的真爱刚刚因为痢疾丧命了。”



这个Ashley是Brett的第一任丈夫，但并不是她的真爱，所以Cohn听到这里的时候很吃惊（"I don't believe she would marry anybody she didn't love."）而Jake则很轻描淡写地回答道这不是第一次了（"Well," I said. "She's done it twice."）其实就是暗指她即将要嫁给的这位Mike Campbell也不是她的真爱，可能只是因为他很快就要发达了（"He's going to be rich as hell some day"）.

但Cohn对于Brett的确是一个花蝴蝶这件事并不关注，而是反过来指责Jake的口气太不尊重了（"I didn't ask you to insult her."）并且对Jake的一句粗口（"Oh, go to hell."）勃然大怒（"You've got to take that back." "Take it back."），虽然Jake最后收回了自己的话（"Oh, don't go to hell," I said. "Stick around. We're just starting lunch."），但从中我们也可以观察到关于Jake的一个为人处世的特征：他通常会隐藏自己的真实感觉和想法——



💧**Clue 2**: Jake hides his feelings away most of the time.

**Evidence 1**: "You say such damned insulting things, Jake." "I'm sorry. I've got a nasty tongue. I never mean it when I say nasty things."

“你竟然说出这么无礼的话，杰克。” “很抱歉，我说话不好听。但心里可绝对不是那个意思。”

**Evidence 2**: "I know it," Cohn said. "You're really about the best friend I have, Jake."

God help you, I thought. "Forget what I said," I said out loud. "I'm sorry."

“我明白了”，科恩说。“实际上，你可算得上是我最好的朋友了，杰克。”

愿上帝保佑你，我心里寻思。“我说的话你可别往心里去，”我说出口来。“对不起。”



Jake对Cohn其实并无好感（大家可以回忆一下在第一天的情节里，Jake一直在尝试摆脱Cohn，不想听他叨唠个不停），这里也再一次描写他内心的真实想法：God help you. 这时候Jake大概的心理活动就是：“天哪，这个人竟然把我当成他最好的朋友。真可别这样！”但他说出口的时候又是另一番语气。可见Jake在与人的交往中较注重自我保护，或者说是倾向于维持表面的平和。这些是否都跟他之前受伤的经历有关呢？我们在之后会继续分析他的性格成因~

### 今日彩蛋

**💧餐厅酒侍是一个什么样的职业？**

In the restaurant we ordered hors d'oeuvres and beer. The sommelier brought the beer, tall, beaded on the outside of the stems, and cold.（到了饭店，我们点了冷盘和啤酒。酒侍端来啤酒，啤酒很凉，高筒酒杯外面结满水珠。）

这里的sommerlier可不是普通上茶端水的服务员，尤其在法国餐厅里，他们几乎可以算是和主厨地位同等重要的角色了。今天的彩蛋我们就来看一看酒侍到底是什么样的角色，以及一个优秀的酒侍都有哪些职责吧~

“酒侍（或酒侍）”（国际通用名称叫Sommelier）三个字，从字面意义上看，是指在宾馆、餐厅里负责酒水饮料的侍者。这也是大多数人对它的理解。而在今天，它的内涵已经延伸，一位好的酒侍不仅要具备专业酒水基础知识和技能，还要懂得设计葡萄酒配菜、具有葡萄酒的鉴赏能力、有深厚的葡萄酒品评基础、熟悉酒品采购要求以及善于对酒窖进行管理。酒侍要有基本的美学修养，有敏感的时尚感知，有高尚的品位，才能有好的鉴赏力，才能真的懂酒。

侍酒有两步非常重要的礼仪，如果做得不好，是会极度影响饭店的形象和声誉，直接导致一家饭店倒闭都有可能。



\1. 呈递礼仪

这个包括酒单呈递和酒瓶展示。首先葡萄酒酒单（Wine List）会详细列出葡萄酒产地、酒庄、等级、年份及价格等，有些也会将葡萄酒的特色，食物搭配建议等也列在酒单上，目前大多数餐厅都以提供葡萄酒酒单的方式让客人作选择，而酒单又只呈送给主人或主人指定的其他人。

然后是酒瓶展示，如果是展示葡萄酒的话，酒侍会将葡萄酒瓶放置在白布上，左手握住瓶身下方，右手握住瓶颈，将卷标朝上，保证客人能清楚地阅读酒标。



\2. 验酒礼仪

首先是客人验酒，在确认包括产地、酒庄、年份和温度等都没有问题后，酒侍才能够准备开瓶。

接下来酒侍开瓶醒酒：不同的酒开瓶方式不同，比如白葡萄酒要在冰桶内进行开酒，而红酒可在客人的餐桌上或餐厅推车上进行。以开瓶器在软木塞中心点位置插入，并以拇指导引方向，开瓶器从中心点徐徐地旋转进入，尽可能使开瓶器深入软木塞，但是也要避免穿透。拔出软木塞时，应保持朝正上方的方向拔除以避免木塞断裂。瓶塞拔除后要用清洁的口布小心地擦拭瓶口，尽量避免木屑掉入瓶内。  

开瓶后非常重要的一点就是醒酒，即将瓶中的葡萄酒倒入另一个容器中，主要有两种类型：

（1）老酒换新瓶，这样可以将沉淀物质去除，饮用时是否需要使用醒酒器视具体情况而定，因为有些老酒同空气大面积接触后会迅速氧化，香气会马上散去；

（2）年轻的葡萄酒在醒酒器中通过与空气大面积地接触来加速将其香气展现出来，另外也可以起到软化单宁的作用。

做酒侍真的不是一个容易的活，远非普通的服务员所能及，除了要有基本的美学修养，敏感的时尚感知、高尚的品位和鉴赏力，还要经过一定时间的培训，比如一个合格的酒侍的成长期至少要四五年，修炼成硕士品酒师还要差不多五年。

所以一个餐厅是否有酒侍在某种程度上也反映了该餐厅的等级段位，大家可以在去餐厅的时候观察一下哦~

At five o'clock I was in the Hotel Crillon (克里翁酒店) waiting for Brett.

She was not there, so I sat down and wrote some letters.

They were not very good letters but I hoped their being on Crillon stationery would help them.

> <font color=red>They were not very good letters / but I hoped / their being on Crillon stationery / would help them.</font>

Brett did not turn up, so about quarter to six I went down to the bar and had a Jack Rose (杰克玫瑰，鸡尾酒) with George the barman.

Brett had not been in the bar either,and so I looked for her up-stairs on my way out, and took a taxi to the café Select.

Crossing the Seine (塞纳河) I saw a string of barges being towed empty down the current, riding high, the bargemen at the sweeps as they came toward the bridge. The river looked nice. It was always pleasant crossing bridges in Paris.

>

The Boulevard Raspail always made dull riding.

It was like a certain stretch on the P.L.M. (巴黎-里昂-马赛路线) between Fontainebleau (枫丹白露) and Montereau (蒙特罗) that always made me feel bored and dead and dull until it was over.

I suppose it is some association of ideas that makes those dead places in a journey.

There are other streets in Paris as ugly as the Boulevard Raspail.

It is a street I do not mind walking down at all. But I cannot stand to ride along it. Perhaps I had read something about it once.

That was the way Robert Cohn was about all of Paris. I wondered where Cohn got that incapacity to enjoy Paris. Possibly from Mencken. Mencken hates Paris, I believe.

So many young men get their likes and dislikes from Mencken.

The taxi stopped in front of the Rotonde. No matter what café in Montparnasse (蒙帕纳斯) you ask a taxi-driver to bring you to from the right bank of the river, they always take you to the Rotonde (洛东达咖啡馆).

Ten years from now it will probably be the Dome (多姆咖啡馆). It was near enough, anyway.

I walked past the sad tables of the Rotonde to the Select.

There were a few people inside at the bar, and outside, alone, sat Harvey Stone. He had a pile of saucers in front of him, and he needed a shave.

"Sit down," said Harvey, "I've been looking for you." "What's the matter?"

"Nothing. Just looking for you."

"Been out to the races?" "No. Not since Sunday."

"What do you hear from the States?" "Nothing. Absolutely nothing."

"What's the matter?" "I don't know. I'm through with them. I'm absolutely through with them."

He leaned forward and looked me in the eye.

"Do you want to know something, Jake?" "Yes."

"I haven't had anything to eat for five days."

I figured rapidly back in my mind. It was three days ago that Harvey had won two hundred francs from me shaking poker dice in the New York Bar.

"What's the matter?" "No money. Money hasn't come," he paused. "I tell you it's strange, Jake. When I'm like this I just want to be alone. I want to stay in my own room. I'm like a cat."

I felt in my pocket. "Would a hundred help you any, Harvey?"

"Yes." "Come on. Let's go and eat." "There's no hurry. Have a drink." "Better eat."

"No. When I get like this I don't care whether I eat or not."

We had a drink. Harvey added my saucer to his own pile.

"Do you know Mencken, Harvey?" "Yes. Why?"

"What's he like?" "He's all right. He says some pretty funny things. Last time I had dinner with him we talked about Hoffenheimer. 'The trouble is,'he said, 'he's a garter snapper.' That's not bad."

"That's not bad." "He's through now," Harvey went on. "He's written about all the things he knows, and now he's on all the things he doesn't know."

"I guess he's all right," I said. "I just can't read him."

"Oh, nobody reads him now," Harvey said, "except the people that used to read the Alexander Hamilton Institute."

"Well," I said. "That was a good thing, too."

"Sure," said Harvey. So we sat and thought deeply for a while.

"Have another port?" "All right," said Harvey.

"There comes Cohn," I said. Robert Cohn was crossing the street.

"That moron," said Harvey. Cohn came up to our table.

> ==moron英 [ˈmɔ:rɒn] 美 [ˈmɔ:rɑ:n] n. <口>傻子；痴愚者==
>
> n. <口>傻子；痴愚者（指心理年龄在8至12岁的成年人）

>
> 💧moron 在口语里指一个人是“傻子，笨蛋”，和idiot一样很不礼貌。它的另一个含义是指“痴愚者”，也就是智力发育低下的（to describe someone whose intelligence has not developed to the normal level）.

"Hello, you bums," he said.

"Hello, Robert," Harvey said. "I was just telling Jake here that you're a moron." "What do you mean?"

"Tell us right off. Don't think. What would you rather do if you could do anything you wanted?"

Cohn started to consider. "Don't think. Bring it right out."

"I don't know," Cohn said. "What's it all about, anyway?"

"I mean what would you rather do. What comes into your head first. No matter how silly it is."

"I don't know," Cohn said. "I think I'd rather play football again with what I know about handling myself, now."

"I misjudged you," Harvey said. "You're not a moron. You're only a case of arrested development."

> ==misjudge英 [ˌmɪsˈdʒʌdʒ] 美 [mɪsˈdʒʌdʒ] vt. 对…判断错误；错认；错误地估计 vi. 判断错==

"You're awfully funny, Harvey," Cohn said. "Some day somebody will push your face in."

Harvey Stone laughed. "You think so. They won't, though. Because it wouldn't make any difference to me.I'm not a fighter."

"It would make a difference to you if anybody did it."

"No, it wouldn't. That's where you make your big mistake. Because you're not intelligent."

"Cut it out about me." "Sure," said Harvey. "It doesn't make any difference to me. You don't mean anything to me."

"Come on, Harvey," I said. "Have another porto."

"No," he said. "I'm going up the street and eat. See you later, Jake."

He walked out and up the street. I watched him crossing the street through the taxis, small, heavy, slowly sure of himself in the traffic.

"He always gets me sore," Cohn said. "I can't stand him."

"I like him," I said. "I'm fond of him. You don't want to get sore at him."

"I know it," Cohn said. "He just gets on my nerves."

"Write this afternoon?" "No. I couldn't get it going. It's harder to do than my first book. I'm having a hard time handling it."

The sort of healthy conceit that he had when he returned from America early in the spring was gone. Then he had been sure of his work, only with these personal longings for adventure.

Now the sureness was gone. Somehow I feel I have not shown Robert Cohn clearly.

The reason is that until he fell in love with Brett, I never heard him make one remark that would, in anyway, detach him from other people.

He was nice to watch on the tennis-court, he had a good body, and he kept it in shape; he handled his cards well at bridge, and he had a funny sort of undergraduate quality about him.

If he were in a crowd nothing he said stood out. He wore what used to be called polo shirts at school, and may be called that still, but he was not professionally youthful.

I do not believe he thought about his clothes much.

Externally he had been formed at Princeton. Internally he had been moulded by the two women who had trained him.

He had a nice, boyish sort of cheerfulness that had never been trained out of him, and I probably have not brought it out.

> ①that had never been trained out of him 强调“这种劲头并没有因为外力而被磨灭掉”；这里作者的用词很值得考究，train作动词最常见的意思是“训练”，在这里更准确的理解是“磨炼、塑造一个人的品格或行为”（to accustom sb to a mode of behavior or performance）.
>
> *这个句子也可以结合上文来理解：Externally he had been formed... Internally he had been moulded... 所以这里是一个转折，虽然Cohn的外表和内在都受到了不同方面的影响，但他的这种cheerfulness依然没有任何削减。

He loved to win at tennis. He probably loved to win as much as Lenglen, for instance.

On the other hand, he was not angry at being beaten. When he fell in love with Brett his tennis game went all to pieces.

>

> *所以his tennis game went all to pieces就是指Cohn在网球比赛中不再像以前一样所向披靡，而是表现得很糟糕，或者说是屡屡战败。

People beat him who had never had a chance with him. He was very nice about it.

Anyhow, we were sitting on the terrace of the café Select, and Harvey Stone had just crossed the street.

"Come on up to the Lilas," I said. "I have a date."

"What time?" "Frances is coming here at seven-fifteen." "There she is."

Frances Clyne was coming toward us from across the street. She was a very tall girl who walked with a great deal of movement. She waved and smiled. We watched her cross the street.

"Hello," she said, "I'm so glad you're here, Jake. I've been wanting to talk to you."

"Hello, Frances," said Cohn. He smiled.

"Why, hello, Robert. Are you here?" She went on, talking rapidly. "I've had the darndest time. This one"--shaking her head at Cohn--"didn't come home for lunch."

"I wasn't supposed to."

"Oh, I know. But you didn't say anything about it to the cook. Then I had a date myself, and Paula wasn't at her office. I went to the Ritz and waited for her, and she never came,and of course I didn't have enough money to lunch at the Ritz--"

"What did you do?" "Oh, went out, of course." She spoke in a sort of imitation joyful manner. "I always keep my appointments. No one keeps theirs, nowadays. I ought to know better. How are you, Jake, anyway?"

"Fine." "That was a fine girl you had at the dance, and then went off with that Brett one."

"Don't you like her?" Cohn asked.

"I think she's perfectly charming. Don't you?" Cohn said nothing.

"Look, Jake. I want to talk with you. Would you come over with me to the Dome? You'll stay here, won't you, Robert? Come on, Jake."

We crossed the Boulevard Montparnasse and sat down at a table. A boy came up with the Paris Times, and I bought one and opened it.

"What's the matter, Frances?"

"Oh, nothing," she said, "except that he wants to leave me."

"How do you mean?" "Oh, he told every one that we were going to be married, and I told my mother and every one, and now he doesn't wantto do it."

"What's the matter?" "He's decided he hasn't lived enough. I knew it would happen when he went to New York."

She looked up, very bright-eyed and trying to talk inconsequentially.

### 背景知识

**💧Henry Louis Mencken 亨利·路易斯·门肯**

Jake和朋友Harvey聊天的时候，反复提到了一个作家，也就是Mencken. 在Jake看来，Cohn很有可能就是因为看了Mencken的书而不喜欢巴黎的（Paris. I wondered where Cohn got that incapacity to enjoy Paris. Possibly from Mencken. Mencken hates Paris, I believe）.

那么门肯究竟是一个什么人物，而海明威又为什么在小说里安插了这个情节呢？接着我们就来了解一下~

门肯（Mencken）（1880-1956）是一位锋芒毕露的散文家、文学批评家。他从事过新闻行业，写散文、讽刺文、文化批评，还是美国英语（American English）的学者。他撰文批评的对象不仅包括社会场所、文学、音乐，还有政治家以及当代运动等。

作为学者，门肯最有名的学术著作要属出版于1919年的《美国语言》（*The American Language*），这本书是在语言学术界广受赞誉。它对美式英文与英式英文进行了对照，并解释了许多富有趣味的美国俚语表达方式之起源，检视美国特殊的地理名称及个人名字，以及分析外来语言语言对美国方言所造成的影响。

作为批评家，他也以擅长过讽刺漫画不露痕迹的讽刺挖苦闻名。一次世界大战结束后，他与人合作创办了《美国信使》杂志，以该杂志为阵地激烈地批评了美国所谓“民主社会”的种种弊端和缺陷，指出美国在文化上所表现出的贫困。同时门肯又坚决主张摆脱欧洲对美国的“保护”，建立起本国的文明。

在文艺方面，门肯提倡创作自由，反对种种清规戒律，认为“作家有描绘他周围生活的自由，他怎么看就怎么写，他爱怎么解释就怎么解释。”

但海明威笔下的主角对他似乎都评价不高，比如Jake的朋友Harvey这样说道："He's through now," Harvey went on. "He's written about all the things he knows, and now he's on all the things he doesn't know."（“门肯的才智已经枯竭了，”哈维接着说。“”凡是他所熟悉的事，几乎全部写完了，现在他着手写的都是他不熟悉的。）

以及："Oh, nobody reads him now," Harvey said, "except the people that used to read the Alexander Hamilton Institute."（唉，现在没人看他的书了，”哈维说，“除非是那些在亚历山大·汉密尔顿学院念过书的人。”）

*Alexander Hamilton Institute 是美国顶尖的私立文理学院，学校宣称自己是全美第二写作能力大学。（文理学院又称“博雅学院”，以本科教育为主，即规模小而精的大学）

关于海明威为什么在书中讽刺甚至贬低作为公共知识分子的门肯，研究海明威的学者很多认为是因为他有“反智主义”（Anti-intellectualism）的倾向，至少他对知识和书本对人的影响是持一定怀疑态度的。简单来说，他认为“书本知识让知识分子无法根据自己的内心作出判断，有点失去自我，甚至变得狭隘和极端”（比如他借Jake之口说很多年轻人的好恶都受门肯影响：“So many young men get their likes and dislikes from Mencken”）.

在小说开头Jake对Cohn因为看了《紫色大地》这本书而开始产生不切实际的想象也是嗤之以鼻的态度（Cohn觉得南美可以让他摆脱心魔，而巴黎的一切都是可厌的），在Jake看来这都是书本知识的影响。

海明威的这种倾向也反应在了他的写作方式上，比如他更注重塑造真正的“人”，而不是存在于作者想象里的，这样的人的特征不是爱天马行空不切实的的，而是“不谈艺术和文学，生活不受思想约束，重视本能和行动。”

### 课文理解

今天的内容故事情节比较轻，因为它的主要目的是塑造人物形象，也就是小说写作手法当中的characterization. 首先是对Jake的性格和气质进行了丰满，比如有两个细节——

💧**Clue 1**:  Jake is generous and sympathetic to some extent.

**Evidence 1**: I figured rapidly back in my mind. It was three days ago that Harvey had won two hundred francs from me shaking poker dice in the New York Bar.

我脑子里马上闪过哈维三天前在“纽约”酒吧间玩扑克骰子赢了我两百法郎的事。

**Evidence 2**: I felt in my pocket. "Would a hundred help you any, Harvey?"

我摸摸自己的口袋。“一百法郎能派上用场吗，哈维？”

首先关于Harvey，从很多地方可以推测出他可能有酗酒的习惯，比如Cohn在街上看到他的时候，他就坐在酒吧外，面前堆了一摞碟子，胡子也好几天没刮了（He had a pile of saucers in front of him, and he needed a shave）. 并且三天前他才从Jake这里赢了两百法郎，结果现在就花光了（"No money. Money hasn't come," he paused）. 这时候Jake便主动提出要资助他一百法郎，丝毫不计较Harvey之前打牌赢了他的事情。当然这也可能是因为Jake本身对Harvey颇具好感（"I like him," I said. "I'm fond of him. You don't want to get sore at him"）.



除了对朋友慷慨大方并且颇具同情心外，Jake的另一个特征是（似乎跟《了不起的盖茨比》里Nick的角色设定非常相似），他身边的人，尤其女性，都愿意和他分享秘密——

💧**Clue 2**: Jake is the sort of person in whom others, especially women, feel comfortable confiding.

**Evidence 1**: "Look, Jake. I want to talk with you. Would you come over with me to the Dome? You'll stay here, won't you, Robert? Come on, Jake."

“听着，杰克，我有话和你说。你陪我到多姆咖啡馆去好吗？罗伯特你就在这待着，行不行？走吧，杰克。”

**Evidence 2**: "What's the matter, Frances?"

"Oh, nothing," she said, "except that he wants to leave me."

"How do you mean?"

"Oh, he told every one that we were going to be married, and I told my mother and every one, and now he doesn't want to do it."

“什么事，弗朗西丝？”

“哦，没什么，”她说，“就是他打算抛弃我了。”

“你这是什么意思？”

“唉，他以前逢人就嚷嚷我们要结婚，我也告诉了我的母亲和诸亲好友，可现在他又要反悔了。”

不仅是Cohn喜欢找Jake聊心事，这回是Cohn的对象Frances也来找Jake谈她和Cohn之间的私事了。这从侧面反映出了Jake很得身边朋友的信任，还有另外一个原因是，我们在昨天也分析过了，Jake倾向于维持人与人之间的表面平和，所以他从不轻易表露自己的喜好或厌恶，也不随意地论断。这种品质也让他拥有了一个在逻辑上合理的“参与者及叙述者”的双重身份。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧Comebacks For Dealing With Sarcastic People**

**怎么机智地回应别人的讽刺挖苦？**



今天Jake的一位朋友Harvey因为很讨厌Cohn，所以冷嘲暗讽地羞辱了他一番。比如他最后干脆不直接说Cohn是蠢蛋（moron），而是改为暗地插刀式的："I misjudged you," Harvey said. "You're not a moron. You're only a case of arrested development."（“我误解你了，”哈维说，“你不是白痴，你只是发育过程出现障碍的一个病例而已。”）

Cohn当然火冒三丈气不打一处来，但他也采用了一种非常错误的反击方式，也就是直接攻击对方："You're awfully funny, Harvey," Cohn said. "Some daysomebody will push your face in."（“你这人说话太放肆，哈维，”科恩说。“总有一天人家会把你的脸揍扁的。”）

结果又被Harvey狠狠将了一军："You think so. They won't, though. Because it wouldn't make any difference to me. I'm not a fighter."（就是你这样想。人家才不会呐。我又不是拳击手，我才不用担心自己的脸被人揍扁。）言下之意是，Cohn自己之前在拳击比赛里还被人把鼻子给打扁了。

其实像Harvey这样的人在生活中并不少见，但无论对方出于何种目的，我们都应该明白两件事：一是不要忍气吞声；二是不要直接反击。那么有什么机智的回应方式呢？今天的彩蛋我们就一起来看看~



\1. "I would like to insult you back but I'm afraid you wouldn't understand me."

“我很想回击你，但我担心你听不懂。”

讽刺者的目的就是要让你觉得他们说的话是针对你的（Sarcasm forces you to think and take things personally）, 最好的解决方式就是不要让对方觉得你当真了，并且不要留下把柄让对方再对你进行反击。所以可以表现出不予置评的态度。



\2. "I don't understand your type of craziness, but I sure admire your commitment to it."

“我搞不懂你在说什么胡话，但我认可你的作的所有努力。”

如果对方是因为一件事情而受到刺激才对你恶语相向，那么你就明确地表示，你对于他（她）作的努力和所有付出是认可的，让他能够冷静地思考问题并且表达自己的诉求（to put them back in their place），然后微笑转身离开（just walk away with a smile on your face）.



\3. "I'm afraid I can't say much since I would be talkig outside of your emotional zip code."

“我不能再多说了。咱俩频率不对，我怕你接收不到。”

沉默是金（Silence is golden）, 谨记这一点。或者把讽刺的话当成另一种幽默，然后以同样的幽默回复对方。



\4. "Remember when I asked for your opinion? Me neither."

“你能想起我什么时候问你意见了吗？反正我是想不起来。”

直接让对方知道他们只是在多管闲事，你不需要他们的意见，这样对方自然就会哑口无言了。

But it does seem to me to be a little late now, after we've waited three years, and I've just gotten my divorce."

I said nothing."We were going to celebrate so, and instead we've just had scenes. It's so childish. We have dreadful scenes, and he cries and begs me to be reasonable, but he says he just can't do it."

"Sure, you could marry anybody." "No, I don't believe it. And I'm fond of him, too. And I'd like to have children. I always thought we'd have children."

She looked at me very brightly. "I never liked children much, but I don't want to think I'll never have them.

I always thought I'd have them and then like them." "He's got children."

"Oh, yes. He's got children, and he's got money, and he's got a rich mother, and he's written a book, and nobody will publish my stuff, nobody at all.

It isn't bad, either. And I haven't got any money at all. I could have had alimony, but I got the divorce the quickest way."

>
> 他们必须找到那些抛弃子女的父亲，让他们支付抚养费。

She looked at me again very brightly. "It isn't right. It's my own fault and it's not, too.

I ought to have known better. And when I tell him he just cries and says he can't marry.

" Why can't he marry? I'd be a good wife. I'm easy to get along with. I leave him alone. It doesn't do any good."

"It's a rotten shame." "Yes, it is a rotten shame. But there's no use talking about it, is there? Come on, let's go back to the café."

"And of course there isn't anything I can do." "No. Just don't let him know I talked to you.

I know what he wants." Now for the first time she dropped her bright, terribly cheerful manner.

"He wants to go back to New York alone, and be there when his book comes out so when a lot of little chickens like it. That's what he wants."

"Maybe they won't like it. I don't think he's that way. Really."

"You don't know him like I do, Jake.That's what he wants to do. I know it. I know it.

That's why he doesn't want to marry. He wants to have a big triumph this fall all by himself."

"Want to go back to the café?" "Yes. Come on."

We got up from the table--they had never brought us a drink-- and started across the street toward the Select, where Cohn sat smiling at us from behind the marble-topped table.

"Well, what are you smiling at?" Frances asked him. "Feel pretty happy?"

"I was smiling at you and Jake with your secrets."

"Oh, what I've told Jake isn't any secret. Everybody will know it soon enough. I only wanted to give Jake a decent version."

"What was it? About your going to England?"

"Yes, about my going to England. Oh, Jake! I forgot to tell you. I'm going to England."

"Isn't that fine!" "Yes, that's the way it's done in the very best families.

Robert's sending me. He's going to give me two hundred pounds and then I'm going to visit friends.

> <font color=red>Robert's sending me.</font>
>
> 罗伯特要打发我。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> send 在这里不是“送某人去某地”，而是一种带有不满和敷衍的“打发”。还有语气更重的一个表达：send sb packing 表示“撵走，让某人收拾东西走人”，比如：After his four years as governor, the voters sent him packing.（他当了四年州长之后，选民叫他滚蛋了。）
>
> 这里再为大家拓展send的一个用法：send sb/sth into (doing) sth. 后面一般加表示状态或情绪的名词，比如send sb into panic就是“使某人陷入惊慌”，send the country plunging into anarchy “使这个国家陷入混乱/无政府状态中”（plunge into表示“陷入”）。

Won't it be lovely? The friends don't know about it, yet."

She turned to Cohn and smiled at him. He was not smiling now.

"You were only going to give me a hundred pounds, weren't you, Robert? But I made him give me two hundred.

He's really very generous. Aren't you, Robert?"

I do not know how people could say such terrible things to Robert Cohn.

There are people to whom you could not say insulting things.

They give you a feeling that the world would be destroyed, would actually be destroyed before your eyes, if you said certain things.

But here was Cohn taking it all. Here it was, all going on right before me, and I did not even feel an impulse to try and stop it. And this was friendly joking to what went on later.

"How can you say such things, Frances?" Cohn interrupted.

"Listen to him. I'm going to England.I'm going to visit friends.

Ever visit friends that didn't want you? Oh, they'll have to take me, all right. How do you do, my dear?

Such a long time since we've seen you. And how is your dear mother?

' Yes, how is my dear mother? She put all her money into French war bonds. Yes, she did. Probably the only person in the world that did. And what about Robert?'

or else very careful talking around Robert. You must be most careful not to mention him, my dear. Poor Frances has had a most unfortunate experience.

' Won't it be fun, Robert? Don't you think it will be fun, Jake?"

She turned to me with that terribly bright smile. It was very satisfactory to her to have an audience for this.

"And where are you going to be, Robert? It's my own fault, all right. Perfectly my own fault.

When I made you get rid of your little secretary on the magazine I ought to have known you'd get rid of me the same way.

Jake doesn't know about that. Should I tell him?"

"Shut up, Frances, for God's sake."

"Yes, I'll tell him. Robert had a little secretary on the magazine.

Just the sweetest little thing in the world, and he thought she was wonderful, and then I came along and he thought I was pretty wonderful, too.

So I made him get rid of her, and he had brought her to Province town from Carmel when he moved the magazine, and he didn't even pay her fare back to the coast.

All to please me. He thought I was pretty fine, then. Didn't you, Robert?

"You mustn't misunderstand, Jake, it was absolutely platonic with the secretary. Not even platonic. Nothing at all, really. It was just that she was so nice.

"You know Robert is going to get material for a new book. Aren't you, Robert? That's why he's leaving me.He's decided I don't film well.

“You see, he was so busy all the time that we were living together, writing on this book, that he doesn't remember anything about us.

“So now he's going out and get some new material. Well, I hope he gets something frightfully interesting.

"Listen, Robert, dear. Let me tell you something. You won't mind, will you?

“Don't have scenes with your young ladies. Try not to. Because you can't have scenes without crying, and then you pity yourself so much you can't remember what the other person's said.

“You'll never be able to remember any conversations that way. Just try and be calm.

I know it's awfully hard. But remember, it's for literature. We all ought to make sacrifices for literature.

“He doesn't read French very well himself. He wasn't a good writer like you are, was he, Robert?

“Do you think he ever had to go and look for material? What do you suppose he said to his mistresses when he wouldn't marry them?

“I'll tell you. It's so simple. I wonder why I never thought about it.

“Why, you see, Robert's always wanted to have a mistress, and if he doesn't marry me, why, then he's had one.

“She was his mistress for over two years. See how it is? And if he marries me, like he's always promised he would, that would be the end of all the romance.

Don't you think that's bright of me to figure that out? It's true, too. Look at him and see if it's not. Where are you going, Jake?"

"I've got to go in and see Harvey Stone a minute."

Cohn looked up as I went in. His face was white. Why did he sit there? Why did he keep on taking it like that?

As I stood against the bar looking out I could see them through the window.

Frances was talking on to him, smiling brightly, looking into his face each time she asked: "Isn't it so, Robert?"

Or maybe she did not ask that now.Perhaps she said something else.

I told the barman I did not want anything to drink and went out through the side door.

As I went out the door I looked back through the two thicknesses ofglass and saw them sitting there.

She was still talking to him. I went down a side street to the Boulevard Raspail (拉斯拜尔大街).

A taxi came along and I got in and gave the driver the address of my flat.

### 背景知识

**💧****Live by the sword, die by the sword**

**凡动刀者，必死于刀下**

"Well, I suppose that we that live by the sword shall perish by the sword. Isn't that literary, though? You want to remember that for your next book, Robert."（“依我看，凡动刀的必死于刀下。这不是文学语言吗？你写第二本书的时候，别忘了把这个写进去，罗伯特。”）

Frances对着Cohn讽刺了一番，而且自嘲说正是因为自己当初是通过强逼的方式得到Cohn并且让他抛弃了他的小秘书 ，所以今天Cohn用一样的方式抛弃了她。这里的that (who) live by the sword shall perish by the sword现在已经成为一句很日常的俚语表达，意思就和我们说“遭报应”很像，但它的来源其实是《圣经》里的一个故事，在《约翰福音》里有记载——

当时的耶稣和使徒在客西马尼园（Garden of Gethsemane）祷告，其中一位使徒（disciple）就是彼得（Peter）. 犹大（Judas）在出卖耶稣的藏身之地后，罗马士兵便赶来要逮捕耶稣。彼得为了保护耶稣 ，便拔刀割下了大祭司（the high priest）仆人的一只耳朵。

这时候耶稣制止了彼得有进一步的危险举动，让他赶紧收刀入鞘，不要再发生流人血的事（Jesus rebuked Peter and put a quick stop to the bloodshed）. 随后耶稣奇迹般的使那个人的耳朵复原并痊愈了。在这后，他就对彼得说了这句“all who draw the sword will die by the sword”.

耶稣想告诫彼得的其实就是，不要用暴力解决暴力（Violence begets violence, but don't end violence） ，否则最后也要自食其果（如果不是耶稣及时阻止，而彼得真的动刀杀了人的话，他也会被逮捕）。

### 课文理解

Frances向Jake哭诉Cohn如何不愿意娶她，她怀疑Cohn就是为了能回到纽约，等他的书出版后就能吸引来一大群年轻女孩的仰慕（"He wants to go back to New York alone, and be there when his book comes out so when a lot of little chickens like it. That's what he wants."）

但Frances对Cohn的“言语霸凌”还不止于此，甚至到了Jake都觉得难以忍受的地步，更让Jake惊讶的是Cohn的无动于衷，他丝毫没有为自己辩解——



💧**Clue 1**:  Frances insults Cohn, but he doesn't stand up for himself.

**Evidence 1**: I do not know how people could say such terrible things to Robert Cohn. There are people to whom you could not say insulting things...But here was Cohn taking it all.

我不明白怎么能当着科恩的面说得这么吓人。往往有这样的人，听不得刻薄话。你一说刻薄话，他们就会暴跳如雷，好像当场天就会塌下来……但是科恩却乖乖地听着。

**Evidence 2**: Cohn looked up as I went in. His face was white. Why did he sit there? Why did he keep on taking it like that?

我走进酒吧间的时候，科恩抬头看着。他脸色煞白。他为什么还坐在那里不走？为什么继续那样受她的数落？

这里再一次展现了Cohn在两性关系中的自卑感，对自我认知的摇摆不定导致他只能受控于Frances. 虽然他从纽约回来后曾经“风光”过一段时间，觉得自己的确拥有吸引女人的魅力，但在重新回归到巴黎的平凡生活中后，这种自信逐渐消退，Cohn又开始变得小心翼翼起来。比如他对Frances的迁就和忍耐："Tell her to go to hell." "I can't. I've got certain obligations to her." — Chapter 5（“告诉她让她见鬼去吧。” “我不能这么做，我对她有责任的。”）



也正是因为这种懦弱性，Cohn在感情里也从来不是一个忠诚的投入者——

💧**Clue 2**:  Cohn has little devotion to romance.

**Evidence 1**: "So I made him get rid of her, and he had brought her to Provincetown from Carmel when he moved the magazine, and he didn't even pay her fare back to the coast. All to please me."

“所以我就叫他把她打发走。当初杂志社迁移的时候，他把她从卡默尔带到了普罗文斯敦，可这时他连回西海岸的旅费也不给她。这一切都是为了讨好我。”

**Evidence 2**: "Why, you see, Robert's always wanted to have a mistress, and if he doesn't marry me, why, then he's had one...And if he marries me, like he's always promised he would, that would be the end of all the romance."

“哦，你知道，罗伯特一直想有个情妇，如果他不跟我结婚，哼，那么他就有我这个情妇……一旦他和我结婚了，正如他经常答应的那样，那么他的整个浪漫史也就告终了。”

Frances口中的Cohn就是那种只会空口承诺但从来不愿意跟你结婚的男人。其实根据Cohn之前的经历也不难看出他在感情中缺乏忠诚和投入。比如他认识Frances的时候正和自己的秘书暧昧，在杂志社迁址的时候还一起带上了她，但当他遇到更风采迷人的Frances后，便把对方撵走了，甚至连回去的旅费都不愿意付。因此当这一次他又陷入了对Brett的迷恋时，他就以自己要去收集写作素材为由离开Frances.

Cohn这个角色有可怜但也有可恨之处，所以Jake对他一直缺乏好感，也就不奇怪他虽然感觉Frances的刻薄话未免太过分，但也没有想要去劝阻的冲动（Here it was, all going on right before me, and I did not even feel an impulse to try and stop it.） 

### 今日彩蛋

**💧古希腊人眼里爱的七种形式**

"You mustn't misunderstand, Jake, it was absolutely platonic with the secretary."（“你千万别误解，杰克，和女秘书的关系纯属精神恋爱。”）

Frances在这里讽刺Cohn和女秘书之间只是“柏拉图式恋爱”，也就是精神恋爱，所以他在遇到风姿绰约的Frances后便把女秘书抛弃了。

“柏拉图式恋爱”（Platonic love）并不是柏拉图自己创造出来的名词，而是后人Marsilio Ficino在15世纪的时候提出来的。最早柏拉图对这种“恋爱关系”的解释是在哲学层面上的，也就是两个人在逐渐超越肉体上的吸引（carnal attraction）并在灵魂上更为亲密的过程中，同时也更接近智慧和真理，直到最后两个人在真理中合而为一。在当时，这种恋爱关系区别于“浪漫式恋爱”（Romantic love）而存在。

后来“柏拉图式恋爱”在演变中有了更具体的分支，也就是“爱的七种形式”，包括“厄洛斯之爱”（Eros）、“菲莉亚之爱”（Philia）、“思多奇之爱”（Storge）、“阿加普之爱”（Agape）、“卢多斯之爱”（Ludus）、“普拉玛之爱”（Pragma）和“腓利塔之爱”（Philautia）. 那么这七种爱都有什么形式和要义呢？我们分别来看看~



1.厄洛斯之爱 Eros love

厄洛斯是希腊中掌管爱和性欲的神（the Greek God of sensual love and desire）. 这个神在罗马神话中对应的就是丘比特（Cupid）啦~ 

在《神谱》中赫西俄德是这样描述厄洛斯神的：“永生神中数他最美，他使全身酥麻，让所有神和人思谋和才智尽失在心怀深处。”据说他会在没有警告的情况下向凡人和神仙射出金箭。希腊人最怕那种爱，因为它是危险的，能使他们陷入最麻烦的境地。

所以“厄洛斯之爱”就是肉体的、情欲的爱。



2.菲莉亚之爱 Philia love

Philia love通常也会写作Brotherly love, 也就是“兄弟之爱”。而在亚里士多德的著作中，Philia则通常被翻译为friendship或affection. 

亚里士多德还列举出了所有可以被称之为Philia的关系，比如：“年轻恋人”（young lovers）、“终生挚友”（lifelong friends）、“政治或生意上的关系”（political or business contacts）、“同行的航海员”（fellow-voyagers）、“战友”（fellow-soldiers）、“同一个宗教组织里的教友”（members of the same religious society）.

简单来说，Philia就是包含着真诚、友好以及信任的关系，可以是合作或是相互依赖的形式（the type of love that is directed towards friendship orgoodwill, often is met with mutual benefits that can also can be formed by companionship, dependability, and trust）. 所以Philia love可以理解为“兄弟/朋友/同僚之爱”。



3.思多奇之爱 Storge love

Storge love也可以翻译为familial love, 也就是“家庭/父母之爱”，一般是指“自然而生的，或是由于本能而产生的好感”（natural or instinctual affection）. 

并且Storge love之中还有很重要的一条准则，也就是这种爱是单边的（unilateral）, 也就是不需要依靠互利（mutual benefit）而存在。这一点和我们上面提到的Philia love很不同。



4.阿加普之爱 Agape love

Agape love被认为是最高形式的爱（"the highest form of love, charity"）, 它还代表了人和上帝之间的爱（"the love of God for man and of man for God"）. 这种爱具有普世性（universal），可以是对陌生人的，或是对于自然万物的，含义非常广泛。

因此Agape love也就是“无私、奉献、无条件之爱”（selfless, sacrificial, unconditional）.



5.卢多斯之爱 Ludus love

Ludus来自拉丁文lusus, 最早的含义和"play, game, sport, training"相关。所以Ludus love倾向于指“玩伴、挑逗或揶揄之爱”（a playful and uncommitted love）, 这种爱不需要承诺，一般以玩乐为目的（focues for fun）. 或者其中一方将另一方视为自己的“俘虏”（conquest）, 占有优势地位。



6.普拉玛之爱 Pragma love

Pragma love被认为是最实际的一种爱（the most practical）, 一般基于责任和理性（duty and reason）以及长期的利益（longer tern interests）, 不需要有所谓的“浪漫感觉”（romantic affection）.

在Pragma love之中，双方都有强烈的为对方服务的意识（an intense notion of being of service）, 并且希望在彼此身上找到价值（to find value in their partners）, 同时共同努力完成目标（to work with their partner to reach a common goal）. 这种爱一般也是最为长久并且稳固的。



7.腓利塔之爱 Philautia love

Philautia love也叫作self-love, 也就是自我之爱。起初这种爱被看作是一种品格上的缺陷（a moral flaw）, 类比于虚荣（vanity）和自私（selfishness）. 在韦伯斯特词典中，Philautia love被定义为“只考虑自己的开心和利益”（to regard for one's own happiness or advantage）. 

但是随着时代发展，Philautia love开始有了更多积极的意义（throughout the centuries this definition has adopted a more positive connotation）, 比如在嬉皮时代（the Hippie era）, 人们开始弘扬这种自我之爱；以及新时代的女权主义运动在心理健康意识上的提升，也延伸出了对自我之爱的关注。也十分强调自我之爱在增进心理健康中的作用。

As I started up the stairs the concierge knocked on the glass of the door of her lodge, and as I stopped she came out.

She had some letters and a telegram.

"Here is the post. And there was a lady here to see you."

"Did she leave a card?"No. She was with a gentleman.

It was the one who was here last night. In the end I find she is very nice."

"Was she with a friend of mine?"I don't know. He was never here before.

He was very large. Very, very large.She was very nice. Very, very nice.

Last night she was, perhaps, a little--" She put her head on one hand and rocked it up and down.

"I'll speak perfectly frankly, Monsieur Barnes. Last night I found her not so gentille ([法]和蔼可亲). Last night I formed another idea of her.

But listen to what I tell you. She is trés, trés gentille ([法]非常、非常和蔼可亲). She is of very good family. It is a thing you can see."

"They did not leave any word?"Yes. They said they would be back in an hour."

"Send them up when they come."Yes, Monsieur Barnes.

And that lady, that lady there is some one. An eccentric, perhaps, but quelqu'une, quelqu'une ([法]高贵人物，高贵人物)!"

The only trouble was that people who did not fall into any of those three categories were very liable to be told there was no one home, chez ([法]在……家里) Barnes.

One of my friends, an extremely underfed-looking painter, who was obviously to Madame Duzinell neither well brought up, of good family, nor a sportsman, wrote me a letter asking if I could get him a pass to get by the concierge so he could come up and see me occasionally in the evenings.

I went up to the flat wondering what Brett had done to the concierge.

The wire was a cable from Bill Gorton, saying he was arriving on the France.

I put the mail on the table, went back to the bedroom, undressed and had a shower.

I was rubbing down when I heard the door-bell pull. I put on a bathrobe and slippers and went to the door.

It was Brett. Back of her was the count. He was holding a great bunch of roses.

"Hello, darling," said Brett. "Aren't you going to let us in?"

"Come on. I was just bathing."

"Aren't you the fortunate man. Bathing."

"Only a shower. Sit down, Count Mippipopolous. What will you drink?"

"I don't know whether you like flowers, sir," the count said, "but I took the liberty of just bringing these roses."

> <font color=red>"I don't know whether you like flowers, sir," the count said, "but I took the liberty ofjust bringing these roses."</font>

"Here, give them to me." Brett took them. "Get me some water in this, Jake."

I filled the big earthenware jug with water in the kitchen, and Brett put the roses in it, and placed them in the centre of the dining-room table.

"I say. We have had a day."You don't remember anything about a date with me at the Crillon?"

"No. Did we have one? I must have been blind."You were quite drunk, my dear," said the count.

"Wasn't I, though? And the count's been a brick, absolutely."

"I ought to have. Gave her two hundred francs."

"Don't be a damned fool."His," she said, and nodded at the count.

"I thought we ought to give her a little something for last night. It was very late."

"He's wonderful," Brett said. "He remembers everything that's happened."

"So do you, my dear."Fancy," said Brett. "Who'd want to? I say, Jake, do we get a drink?"

"You get it while I go in and dress. You know where it is."Rather."

While I dressed I heard Brett put down glasses and then a siphon, and then heard them talking.

I dressed slowly, sitting on the bed. I felt tired and pretty rotten.

Brett came in the room, a glass in her hand, and sat on the bed.

"What's the matter, darling? Do you feel rocky?"

She kissed me coolly on the forehead.

"Oh, Brett, I love you so much."

"Darling," she said. Then: "Do you want me to send him away?"

"No. He's nice."I'll send him away."

"No, don't."Yes, I'll send him away."

"You can't just like that."Can't I, though? You stay here. He's mad about me, I tell you."

She was gone out of the room. I layface down on the bed.

I was having a bad time. I heard them talking but I did not listen.

Brett came in and sat on the bed."Poor old darling." She stroked my head.

"What did you say to him?" I was lying with my face away from her. I did not want to see her.

"Sent him for champagne. He loves to go for champagne."

Then later: "Do you feel better, darling? Is the head any better?"

"It's better."Lie quiet. He's gone to the other side of town."

"Couldn't we live together, Brett? Couldn't we just live together?"

"I don't think so. I'd just tromper ([法]欺骗，对……不忠) you with everybody. You couldn't stand it."

"I stand it now."That would be different. It's my fault, Jake. It's the way I'm made."

"Couldn't we go off in the country for a while?"

"It wouldn't be any good. I'll go if you like.

But I couldn't live quietly in the country. Not with my own true love."

"I know."Isn't it rotten? There isn't any use my telling you I love you."

"You know I love you."Let's not talk.Talking's all bilge. I'm going away from you, and then Michael's coming back."

"Why are you going away?"Better for you. Better for me."

"When are you going?"Soon as I can."

"Where?"San Sebastian."

"Can't we go together?"No. That would be a hell of an idea after we'd just talked it out."

"We never agreed."Oh, you know as well as I do. Don't be obstinate, darling."

"Oh, sure," I said. "I know you're right. I'm just low, and when I'm low I talk like a fool."

I sat up, leaned over, found my shoes beside the bed and put them on. I stood up.

"Don't look like that, darling."How do you want me to look?"

"Oh, don't be a fool. I'm going away to-morrow."To-morrow?"

"Yes. Didn't I say so? I am."Let's have a drink, then. The count will be back."

"Yes. He should be back. You know he's extraordinary about buying champagne. It means any amount to him."

We went into the dining-room. I tookup the brandy bottle and poured Brett a drink and one for myself.

There was a ring at the bell-pull. I went to the door and there was the count.

Behind him was the chauffeur carrying a basket of champagne.

"Where should I have him put it, sir?" asked the count.

"In the kitchen," Brett said."Put it in there, Henry," the count motioned.

"Now go down and get the ice." He stood looking after the basket inside the kitchen door.

"I think you'll find that's very good wine," he said.

"I know we don't get much of a chance to judge good wine in the States now, but I got this from a friend of mine that's in the business."

> 伯爵之所以说很难品尝到好酒，是因为当时美国正举国上下颁行禁酒令，也就是从1919年通过宪法第十八修正案“禁止制造、销售含酒精的饮料”开始，直到1933年通过宪法第二十一修正案，在撤销禁令。

"Oh, you always have some one in the trade," Brett said.

"This fellow raises the grapes. He's got thousands of acres of them."

"What's his name?" asked Brett. "Veuve Cliquot?"

"No," said the count. "Mumms. He's a baron."

"Isn't it wonderful," said Brett. "We all have titles. Why haven't you a title, Jake?"

"I assure you, sir," the count put his hand on my arm. "It never does a man any good. Most of the time it costs you money."

"Oh, I don't know. It's damned useful sometimes," Brett said.

"I've never known it to do me any good."You haven't used it properly. I've had hell's own amount of credit on mine."

"Do sit down, count," I said. "Let me take that stick."

The count was looking at Brett across the table under the gaslight.

She was smoking a cigarette and flicking the ashes on the rug.

> ==flick英 [flɪk] 美 [flɪk] v. 轻弹，轻击；轻拂；忽然摇动 n. 电影；轻弹，轻拂；==

She saw me notice it. "I say, Jake, Idon't want to ruin your rugs. Can't you give a chap an ash-tray?"

I found some ash-trays and spread them around. The chauffeur came up with a bucket full of salted ice.

"Put two bottles in it, Henry," the count called."Anything else, sir?"No. Wait down in the car."

He turned to Brett and to me. "We'll want to ride out to the Bois for dinner?"

"If you like," Brett said. "I couldn't eat a thing."

"I always like a good meal," said the count.

"Should I bring the wine in, sir?" asked the chauffeur.

"Yes. Bring it in, Henry," said the count. He took out a heavy pigskin cigar-case and offered it to me.

"Like to try a real American cigar?"Thanks," I said. "I'll finish the cigarette."

He cut off the end of his cigar with a gold cutter he wore on one end of his watch-chain.

"I like a cigar to really draw," said the count. "Half the cigars you smoke don't draw."

He lit the cigar, puffed at it, looking across the table at Brett. "And when you're divorced, Lady Ashley, then you won't have a title."

"No. What a pity."No," said the count.

"You don't need a title. You got class all over you."

"Thanks. Awfully decent of you."I'm not joking you," the count blew a cloud of smoke.

"You got the most class of anybody I ever seen. You got it. That's all."

"Nice of you," said Brett. "Mummy would be pleased.

Couldn't you write it out, and I'll send it in a letter to her."

"I'd tell her, too," said the count. "I'm not joking you. I never joke people. Joke people and you make enemies. That's what I always say."

"You're right," Brett said. "You're terribly right.

I always joke people and I haven't a friend in the world. Except Jake here."

"You don't joke him."That's it."

### 背景知识

**💧****San Sebastian 圣塞巴斯蒂安**

Brett告诉Jake自己很快就要和未婚夫Michael（Brett的未婚夫全名为Mike Campbell, Michael是Brett对他的昵称）一起到San Sebastian去了："When are you going?" "Soon as I can." "Where?" "San Sebastian."

San Sebastian其实不在法国境内，而是距其仅20公里的海滨小城，位于西班牙北部的巴斯克自治州（Basque）. 很多人对这个城市的了解可能来自于它所举办的闻名世界的“圣塞巴斯蒂安电影节”（San Sebastian International Film Festival），是除了戛纳、威尼斯和柏林电影节之外的五大国际电影节之一，最高奖项叫作“金贝壳奖”。这个奖项的名称来源于西班牙一处著名的度假胜地——贝壳湾（La Concha Bay ）.

它因形状像扇贝而得名，海湾中央的一座岩石就如同贝壳中的明珠。它的名声大噪据说是因为当伊丽莎白一世女王生病时，医生建议她洗海水浴，她就选择了贝壳湾疗养，果然很快痊愈。由此大量游客慕名而来，贝壳湾也渐渐成为了欧洲人的度假胜地。

此外San Sebastian因为背山靠海获取食材便利等天然优势，加上悠久的饮食文化，成为了全世界人均米其林星第二多的城市（第一是京都）；而且它几乎可以算是整个欧洲的料理重镇，还专门设有提供料理学文凭的料理中心（Basque Culinary Center）.

这里想要为大家介绍的是西班牙一种传统的平民小吃——Pintxos. 这个词语本身是指插食物用的牙签， 最开始是酒馆为了方便，事先把烧好的食物用木签串起来，等到客人点的时候再进行加热。当然现在这种店面都是让客人现点，然后再现串现烧，牙签就变成只是形式了。

最简单的Pintxos一般就是一片面包和几片肉，再捎带一根香肠或者一个煎蛋，末了再串上一根小青辣椒，便捷又美味。

### 课文理解

自Brett失约没有在酒店出现后，她竟然带着伯爵一起到了Jake家。趁着把伯爵打发去买香槟的间隙，Brett和Jake有了一次深入的对谈。这也让我们看到了Jake在Brett面前卑微懦弱、吞下自尊和骄傲的一面——

💧**Clue 1**:  Jake really swallows his pride.



**Evidence 1**: "Couldn't we live together, Brett? Couldn't we just live together?"

"I don't think so. I'd just tromper you with everybody. You couldn't stand it."

"I stand it now."

“我们不能在一块过，勃莱特？我们不能就那么住到一起？”

“我看不行。我会见人就搞关系对你不忠实。你会受不了的。”

“我现在不是能受得了吗！”

**Evidence 2**: "Couldn't we go off in the country for a while?"

"It wouldn't be any good. I'll go if you like. But I couldn't live quietly in the country. Not with my own true love."

“我们能不能到乡间去住一阵子？”

“一点好处也没有。如果你喜欢，我就去。不过我在乡间不会安安静静地待着。和我真正心爱的人在一起也不行。”

在Brett的态度无比坚决的情况下，Jake表现出了我们在前面的情节里没有看到的一种铁汉柔情，或者说是卑微。因为生理机能上的残缺，Jake只能容忍自己的心爱之人另觅他欢。这也是这整个故事最大的冲突来源：Jake对Brett痴心不改，但Brett却不能为他放弃自己的花花世界（"It's my fault, Jake. It's the way I'm made."）所以两个人将一直纠缠不明下去。



💧**Clue 2**: Brett is careless and poor in manners.



**Evidence 1**: She was smoking a cigarette and flicking the ashes on the rug. She saw me notice it. "I say, Jake, I don't want to ruin your rugs. Can't you give a chap an ash-tray?"

她在抽烟，往地摊上弹烟灰。她看见我注意到了。“喂，杰克，我不愿意弄脏你的地毯。你不能给我个烟灰缸吗？”

Brett在察觉到Jake非常介意她把烟灰弹到地毯上的时候，才若无其事地问他要烟灰缸，并且一点没有感觉到歉意。这个细节其实是一个讽刺，因为在此之前，三个人刚刚谈到关于“头衔”的话题，并且首先是Brett挑起的（"Isn't it wonderful," said Brett. "We all have titles. Why haven't you a title, Jake?"）。

但Brett的头衔只不过是因为她的丈夫的爵位身份，所以伯爵提醒她一旦离婚，她的头衔就没有了（"And when you're divorced, Lady Ashley, then you won't have a title"）. 此外，头衔对于Brett来说也只是多了一个便利（"Oh, I don't know. It's damned useful sometimes," Brett said.）和身份教养都无关，这在一定程度上也体现出了她的虚荣心。

反而是Jake这个没有头衔的人，在伯爵看来却是他见过的人当中最有高贵优雅气质的（"I'm not joking you," the count blew a cloud of smoke. "You got the most class of anybody I ever seen. You got it. That's all."）联系我们之前提到过的海明威对上层阶级抱着天然的敌意和鄙夷，也就不难理解他在这里借着笔下的角色嘲讽了一番。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****English idioms from horse racing**

**源自马术的英语俚语**

在欧洲有一句古老流传的谚语：“会骑马的不一定是贵族，但贵族一定会骑马”。马术在欧洲是一项有着悠久历史的贵族运动，而现代马术其实起源于英国，16世纪传入欧洲。所以马术的传统和文化也对英语表达影响深远。今天的彩蛋我们一起来看一看来源于马术的英语俚语都有哪些~



\1. Dead heat

胜负不分

这个短语可不能按照字面理解为“very hot”. 在早期英国赛马中，个人赛一般被称作“heats”. 所以如果双方同时到达了终点，裁判就会宣布“dead”, 并且这一轮成绩无效（dead这个词在体育运动中使用很多哦~比如它还可以指“球落到界外”，The ball is dead.）

但是在今天的马术比赛中，出现胜负不分的情况时，双方都可以同时赢得比赛（both horses pay off as winners）, 所以实际上已经不是dead了。

dead heat现在不仅限于在马术比赛中使用，其他的体育运动或者是政治选举都会用到这个表达，也就是指“势均力敌，不相上下”（a situation during a race or competition, etc. when two or more people are at the same level）, 比如：

The two candidates are in a dead heat in the polls.

两名候选人在民意测验中势均力敌。



\2. Across the board

全部包括在内

across the board在马术里是押注的一种形式。最基本的马票有三种：Win, Place, Show.

Win 是要选定的赛马获得第一名才能得到赌注；

Place 是获得第一名或第二名皆可得到赌注（但赌金会比上一种少）；

Show 也就是获得第一、二或三即可得到赌注（同理，因为风险最低，所以赌金也是三种当中最少的）。

而across the board就是三张马票都一起买了，如果这匹马获得了第一名，那么投注者就可以兑现这三张彩票的赌注（When a horse is bet across the board, in the event of a win the bettor will cash all three tickets）.

所以我们今天用across the board的时候就是指“全面地，涉及全员地”（something applies to everything or everyone in a set）. 比如：

The changes will affect local authoritiesacross the board.

这些变化将涉及所有的地方政府。

We find jobs for people right across the board, from chief executives to cleaners.

我们为各行各业人士寻找工作，从行政主管到清洁人员无所不包。



\3. Hands down

轻而易举

用Hands down来形容一个人赢得比赛或是选举的时候，其实就是在指非常轻而易举、唾手可得（to win easily and without any trouble）.

在马术比赛当中，如果一匹马从一出发就摇摇领先（when a horse pulls out to so commanding of a lead）, 那么骑师就不需要再挥鞭策马（then a jockey doesn't need to go to a whip, or do anything at all）, 只管骑在上面等着冲破终点线。

这时候大家就会说The jockey won hands down.（骑师的手啥也没干，全靠马自己在跑：He or she puts their hands down and lets the horse do all the work coming home.）

所以hands down就表示easily and decisively; without question. 我们再来看几个例句：

He won the election hands down. 

他轻易地当选了。

We were really unprepared for our last game, and the other team won hands down.

我们没有好好准备决赛，结果别的队伍毫无悬念地赢了比赛。

另外hands down在口语里也非常好用哦~当我们想表示“毫无疑问，绝对”的时候，hands down就可以用来替换definitely或者exactly, 比如：

This is the best pie I've ever had, hands down!

这是我吃过的最好吃的派！
