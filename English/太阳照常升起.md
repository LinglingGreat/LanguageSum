Robert Cohn was once middleweight boxing champion of Princeton.

Do not think that I am very much impressed by that as a boxing title, but it meant a lot to Cohn.

He cared nothing for boxing, in fact he disliked it, but he learned it painfully and thoroughly to counteract the feeling of inferiority and shyness he had felt on being treated as a Jew at Princeton.

There was a certain inner comfort in knowing he could knock down anybody who was snooty to him, although, being very shy and a thoroughly nice boy, he never fought except in the gym.

He was Spider Kelly's star pupil.

> Spider Kelly的原名是Tommy "Spider" Kelly (1867.9.6 – 1927.1.4），来自纽约的黑人区（Harlem, New York）, 因此大家也会把他称作“The Harlem Spider”. 在1890到1892之间，他都是最轻量级拳击手中的世界冠军（the world champion bantamweight fighter）.

Spider Kelly taught all his young gentlemen to box like featherweights, no matter whether they weighed one hundred and five or two hundred and five pounds.

>

> 拳击比赛分为8个体重级别，Spider Kelly属于的是Bantamweight（“最轻量级”），bantam这个词原本指“矮脚鸡”，体重在112到118磅之间（约51到54公斤）的拳击手属于这个级别；而Featherweight则是“羽量级”，这一级别的拳击手体重在118到126磅（约54到57公斤）之间。Cohnn本身是属于Middleweight “中量级”的（Robert Cohn was once middleweight boxing champion of Princeton），体重约在73公斤以下。

But it seemed to fit Cohn. He was really very fast.

He was so good that Spider promptly overmatched him and got his nose permanently flattened.

> ==permanently英 ['pɜ:mənəntlɪ] 美 [ˈpəmənəntlɪ] adv. 永久地，长期不变地==
>
> <font color=red>He was so good that Spider promptly overmatched him and got his nose permanently flattened.</font>
>
> 他学得很好，斯拜德马上安排他跟强手交锋，给他终生留下了一个扁平的鼻子。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①overmatch的本义是指“比……强”，比如be a match for表示“旗鼓相当”，而overmatch就是to be more than a match for.
>
> *但是这里的overmatch并不是指Spider比Cohn厉害然后把他的鼻子打扁了；在体育术语里，overmatch指“为……安排强手”（to match with a superior opponent）. 所以这里是Spider看到Cohn学得很优秀，所以马上让他跟高手过招。
>
> ②flatten从“使变平”这个意思还可以引申为“夷为平地，炸平”，相当于level. 比如：Hundreds of homes were flattened/levelled by the tornado. 数百户住宅被龙卷风夷为平地。

This increased Cohn's distaste for boxing, but it gave him a certain satisfaction of some strange sort, and it certainly improved his nose.

> <font color=red>This increased Cohn's distaste for boxing, but it gave him a certain satisfaction of some strange sort, and it certainly improved his nose.</font>

> 这件事增加了科恩对拳击的反感，但也给了他某种异样的满足，也确实使他的鼻子变得好看了些。
>
> **💧表达精讲**

> improved his nose “使他的鼻子变得好看了些”；improve笼统地表示to make sth better, 但是用在具体的语境里有不同的含义，比如：Many wines improve with age. 这里的improve就是指酒更香醇了。
>
> **💧知识拓展**
>
> 为什么把鼻子打扁了些反而还好看了呢？这其实源于对犹太人面部特征的刻板印象。在13世纪中叶的欧洲，犹太人的鹰钩鼻（hooked noses）往往在画作里被过度渲染成充满敌意的样子（singled out as a hostile caricature），以致于后来一提到犹太人，大家就觉得他们都是鼻梁突起高耸、然后鼻头向下弯。Cohn在大学的时候遭受嘲笑也多半是因为这个，现在鼻子扁了一点，他反而感到庆幸。

In his last year at Princeton he read too much and took to wearing spectacles. I never met any one of his class who remembered him.

They did not even remember that he was middleweight boxing champion.

I mistrust all frank and simple people, especially when their stories hold together, and I always had a suspicion that perhaps Robert Cohn had never been middleweight boxing champion,

> <font color=red>I mistrust all frank and simple people, especially when their stories hold together...</font>

>
> *hold together在这里指故事“逻辑完整、无懈可击的”。

and that perhaps a horse had stepped on his face, or that maybe his mother had been frightened or seen something, or that he had, maybe, bumped into something as a young child,

but I finally had somebody verify the story from Spider Kelly.

> ==verify英 [ˈverɪfaɪ] 美 [ˈvɛrəˌfaɪ] vt. 核实；证明；判定==

Spider Kelly not only remembered Cohn. He had often wondered what had become of him.

Robert Cohn was a member, through his father, of one of the richest Jewish families in New York,and through his mother of one of the oldest.

At the military school where he prepped for Princeton, and played a very good end on the football team, no one had made him race-conscious.

> ==prep vt. 使(某人)做好进行手术〔考试〕的准备==
>
> ==race-conscious 种族意识的==

No one had ever made him feel he was a Jew, and hence any different from anybody else, until he went to Princeton.

He was a nice boy, a friendly boy, and very shy, and it made him bitter.

He took it out in boxing, and he came out of Princeton with painful self-consciousness and the flattened nose, and was married by the first girl who was nice to him.

He was married five years, had three children, lost most of the fifty thousand dollars his father left him, the balance of the estate having gone to his mother, hardened into a rather unattractive mould under domestic unhappiness with a rich wife;

> <font color=red>He was married five years, / had three children, / lost most of the fifty thousand dollars his father left him, / the balance of the estate having gone to his mother, / hardened into a rather unattractive mould under domestic unhappiness with a rich wife...</font>
>
> 他结婚五年，生了三个孩子，父亲留给他的五万美元几乎挥霍殆尽（遗产的其余部分归他母亲所有），由于和有钱的妻子过着不幸的家庭生活，他变得冷漠无情、使人讨厌……
>
> **💧句式拆解**
>
> ①首先来看这个句子主体部分的谓语有哪些：He was married..., had..., lost..., hardened into...（注意这里没有按照通常的语法规则用and作连接）；
>
> ②the balance of the estate having gone to his mother 属于独立主格结构（在盖茨比当中出现过不只一次哦~）整个句子本身的主语是he（Cohn），这里出现了the balance of the estate作主语，后面则是having gone的现在分词短语作伴随状语；因为主语不同，所以整个结构都是可以独立在句子之外来看的；
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①the balance of the estate “遗产的其余部分”；estate常见指“庄园，住宅”，但在这里是“个人全部财产（尤指遗产）”；balance表示“剩余（部分）”，也就是the rest. 比如：The firm owns about 96% of the portfolio, with the balance belonging to our family. （资产组合中，公司拥有96%左右的股份，剩余部分为我们家族所有。）
>
> *再补充一个知识点，balance从“剩余”这个含义还延伸出了很多日常惯用表达，比如表示“银行账户余额”：My bank balance isn’t good.（我的银行账户里余额不多了。）
>
> 还可以用来指“假期余额”: The balance of my annual leave still has 5 days.（我剩下的年假还有5天。）
>
> ②harden into 指“变得冷酷无情”（to become less sympathetic and gentle）, 比如：Her years of drunken bickering hardened my heart.（她常年醉酒吵闹让我的心麻木了。）
>
> ③a rather unattractive mould “讨人厌的类型”；mould本义是“模具”，在这里指“人的气质类型”（type of person）. 比如：a hero in the ‘Superman’ mould（“超人”型的英雄）

and just when he had made up his mind to leave his wife she left him and went off with a miniature-painter.

> ==miniature英 [ˈmɪnətʃə(r)] 美 [ˈmɪniəˌtʃʊr, -tʃɚ, ˈmɪnə-] adj. 小型的，微小的 n. 微型复制品；微小模型；微型画；微型人像画==

As he had been thinking for months about leaving his wife and had not done it because it would be too cruel to deprive her of himself, her departure was a very healthful shock.

The divorce was arranged and Robert Cohn went out to the Coast.

In California he fell among literary people and, as he still had a little of the fifty thousand left, in a short time he was backing a review of the Arts.

The review commenced publication in Carmel, California, and finished in Province town, Massachusetts.

By that time Cohn, who had been regarded purely as an angel, and whose name had appeared on the editorial page merely as a member of the advisory board, had become the sole editor.

It was his money and he discovered he liked the authority of editing. He was sorry when the magazine became too expensive and he had to give it up.

By that time, though, he had other things to worry about. He had been taken in hand by a lady who hoped to rise with the magazine.

> <font color=red>He had been taken in hand by a lady who hoped to rise with the magazine.</font>
>
> 他已经被一位指望跟这家杂志一起飞黄腾达的女士捏在手心里了。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> had been taken in hand “被捏在手心里”，take sb in hand也就是“掌控、支配某人”，hand在这里相当于control. 比如a manager with a firm hand表示“一位手段强硬（管理严格）的经理”。

She was very forceful, and Cohn never had a chance of not being taken in hand. Also he was sure that he loved her.

When this lady saw that the magazine was not going to rise, she became a little disgusted with Cohn and decided that she might as well get what there was to get while there was still something available, so she urged that they go to Europe, where Cohn could write.

They came to Europe, where the lady had been educated, and stayed three years. During these three years, the first spent in travel, the last two in Paris, Robert Cohn had two friends, Braddocks and myself. Braddocks was his literary friend. I was his tennis friend.

The lady who had him, her name was Frances, found toward the end of the second year that her looks were going, and her attitude toward Robert changed from one of careless possession and exploitation to the absolute determination that he should marry her.

> ==exploitation英 [ˌeksplɔɪˈteɪʃn] 美 [ˌɛksplɔɪˈteʃən] n. 开发；剥削；利用==
>
> n. 开发；剥削；利用
>
> ...and her attitude toward Robert changed from one of careless possession and exploitation to the absolute determination that he should marry her.
>
> 一反过去漫不经心地掌握并利用科恩的常态，断然决定他必须娶她。
>
> 💧exploitation可以指贬义上的“剥削，利用”，也可以指中性意义上的“开发，开采”，比如：the controlled exploitation of resources（有节制的资源开发）

During this time Robert's mother had settled an allowance on him, about three hundred dollars a month. During two years and a half I do not believe that Robert Cohn looked at another woman.

He was fairly happy, except that, like many people living in Europe, he would rather have been in America, and he had discovered writing.

He wrote a novel, and it was not really such a bad novel as the critics later called it, although it was a very poor novel. He read many books, played bridge, played tennis, and boxed at a local gymnasium.

> ==gymnasium英 [dʒɪmˈneɪziəm] 美 [dʒɪmˈneziəm] n. 健身房，体育馆==

I first became aware of his lady's attitude toward him one night after the three of us had dined together. We had dined at l'Avenue's and afterward went to the café? de Versailles for coffee.

We had several fines ([法]白兰地) after the coffee, and I said I must be going. Cohn had been talking about the two of us going off somewhere on a weekend trip.

He wanted to get out of town and get in a good walk.

I suggested we fly to Strasbourg and walk up to Saint Odile, or somewhere or other in Alsace.

"I know a girl in Strasbourg who can show us the town," I said.

Somebody kicked me under the table.

I thought it was accidental and went on: "She's been there two years and knows everything there is to know about the town. She's a swell girl."

> ==swell adj. 漂亮的；一流的==

I was kicked again under the table and, looking, saw Frances, Robert's lady, her chin lifting and her face hardening.

"Hell," I said, "why go to Strasbourg? We could go up to Bruges, or to the Ardennes."

Cohn looked relieved. I was not kicked again. I said good-night and went out.

Cohn said he wanted to buy a paper and would walk to the corner with me.

"For God's sake," he said, "why did you say that about that girl in Strasbourg for? Didn't you see Frances?"

"No, why should I? If I know an American girl that lives in Strasbourg what the hell is it to Frances?"

"It doesn't make any difference. Any girl. I couldn't go, that would be all." "Don't be silly."

"You don't know Frances. Any girl at all. Didn't you see the way she looked?"

"Oh, well," I said, "let's go to Senlis." "Don't get sore."

"I'm not sore. Senlis is a good place and we can stay at the Grand Cerf and take a hike in the woods and come home."

"Good, that will be fine." "Well, I'll see you tomorrow at the courts," I said.

"Good-night, Jake," he said, and started back to the café? "You forgot to get your paper," I said.

"That's so." He walked with me up to the kiosque at the corner. "You are not sore, are you, Jake?" He turned with the paper in his hand.

"No, why should I be?" "See you at tennis," he said. I watched him walk back to the café? holding his paper.I rather liked him and evidently she led him quite a life.

> <font color=red>I rather liked him and evidently she led him quite a life.</font>
>
> 我挺喜欢他，可弗朗西丝显然弄得他的日子很不好过。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> quite a life 在这里有讽刺、调侃的意味，暗指quite a bad/terrible life；通常quite用于强调后面的名词有不寻常的地方（一般是正面的），比如：That was quite a party you had.（你的聚会搞得非常不错。）但这里结合语境应是在说反话。

### 背景知识

**💧1. About the author**

欧内斯特·米勒·海明威（Ernest Miller Hemingway，1899年7月21日－1961年7月2日），出生于美国伊利诺伊州芝加哥市郊区奥克帕克，美国作家、记者，被认为是20世纪最著名的小说家之一。

孩童时代的海明威喜欢读图画书和动物漫画，听各类型的故事。还承袭了父亲的兴趣，如打猎、钓鱼、在森林和湖泊中露营等。自高中起，海明威在写作上的天赋就已经崭露头角，因此18岁高中毕业时，又因为不愿意读大学，所以他便直接到了报社当记者开始写作生涯。

1918年，第一次世界大战爆发后，海明威不顾父亲的反对，辞掉了记者一职，并尝试加入美国军队以观察第一次世界大战的战斗情况。但是由于视力缺陷导致体检不及格，他最后被调到红十字会担任救护车司机。这段经历让海明威目睹了战争的残酷，他早期的小说《永别了，武器》（*Farewell to Arms*）的创作灵感便来源于此。

（1918年的海明威）

1921年，海明威娶了他的第一任妻子——哈德莉·理察逊（Hadley Richardson），并在9月迁到了芝加哥北部的三层公寓居住。到12月，海明威一家迁出国外。在巴黎居住的期间，海明威创作了《在我们的时代里》、《太阳照常升起》等作品。

（1926年一家三口）

离婚后，他迎娶了第二任妻子——宝琳·费孚（Pauline Pfeiffer），举家回到美国，过上了宁静的田园生活。

（1931到1939年间海明威在佛罗里达的居所）

1937年至1938年，他以战地记者的身份奔波于西班牙内战（Spanish Civil War）前线，创作了以美国人参加西班牙人民反法西斯战争为题材的长篇小说《丧钟为谁而鸣》（1940）。在第二次世界大战期间，他也作为记者随军行动，并参加了解放巴黎的战斗。

战后海明威客居古巴，潜心写作。1952年，《老人与海》问世，深受好评，翌年获普利策奖（Pulitzer Prize）. 1954年获贝尔文学奖。卡斯特罗掌权后，他离开古巴返美定居。因身上多处旧伤，百病缠身，精神忧郁，1961年7月2日用猎枪自杀。

**💧2. About the book**

《太阳照常升起》是海明威创作的第一部长篇小说，书名来自于扉页摘抄的《圣经》“传道书”中的经文：

One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.

The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.

一代过去、一代又来，地却永远长存。

日头出来、日头落下、急归所出之地。



The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.

风往南刮、又向北转、不住的旋转、而且返回转行原道。



All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.

江河都往海里流、海却不满．江河从何处流、仍归还何处。



小说本身以1924年至1925年这一历史时段和名城巴黎为背景，故事的主人公都在感情上遭受过创伤，或者因为战争而落下心理或生理机能障碍。作者描绘了他们在失落和绝望中放浪形骸，向醉生梦死、浮躁喧闹的生活方式寻求刺激和慰藉的精神状态，同时也展现了他们在一边愤世嫉俗一边寻求出路的努力。

故事的主要情节是美国青年巴恩斯（Jake Barnes）在第一次世界大战中脊椎受伤，失去性能力，战后在巴黎任记者时与英国人阿施利夫人（Lady Brett Ashley）相爱，夫人一味追求享乐，而他只能借酒浇愁。两人和一帮男女朋友去西班牙潘普洛纳（Pamplona）参加斗牛节，追求精神刺激。夫人拒绝了犹太青年科恩（Robert Cohn）的苦苦追求，却迷上了年仅十九岁的斗牛士罗梅罗（Romero）. 然而，在相处了一段日子以后，由于双方年龄实在悬殊，而阿施利夫人又不忍心毁掉纯洁青年的前程，这段恋情黯然告终。夫人最终回到了巴恩斯身边，尽管双方都清楚，彼此永远也不能真正地结合在一起。

借这本书，海明威成为了名副其实“迷惘的一代”的代言人，并以此书开创了海明威式的独特文风。关于“迷惘的一代”（The Lost Generation），这个称呼首先是美国文学评论家格特鲁德·斯坦因（Gertrude Stein）提出的对于第一次世界大战到第二次世界大战期间出现的美国一类作家的总称。《太阳照常升起》扉页上的题词就是她写的："You are all a lost generation"（你们都是迷惘的一代。）

“迷惘的一代”共同表现出的是对美国社会发展的一种失望和不满。他们之所以迷惘，是因为这一代人的传统价值观念完全不再适合战后的世界，可是他们又找不到新的生活准则。他们认为，只有现实才是真理，可现实是残酷的。于是他们只能按照自己的本能和感官行事，竭力反叛以前的理想和价值观，用叛逆思想和行为来表达他们对现实的不满。

但《太阳照常升起》不仅是“迷惘的一代”的代言作，对于今天身处迷惘以及有前卫和逆反青年、渴望独创艺术以及更加开放的心灵空间的读者来说，这本书也会让他们找到共鸣。

### 课文理解

和《了不起的盖茨比》相同，《太阳照常升起》也是以第一人称的口吻来写的，叙述者是Jake Barnes. 在一开篇，Jake没有交代自己的背景，而是先介绍了另一位主人公Robert Cohn. 根据Jake的描述，他们是Cohn再婚后搬到欧洲才认识的。Jake也是Cohn在法国唯二的朋友之一，俩人是网球的球友（During these three years, the first spent in travel, the last two in Paris, Robert Cohn had two friends, Braddocks and myself. Braddocks was his literary friend. I was his tennis friend）.

Cohn是一个非常有意思的人物，他的身上有很多矛盾点，比如他因为犹太人的身份在大学时期受到种族歧视而很怨愤，当通过学习拳击可以把那些目空一切的人击倒的时候，他的心里才稍微获得了一点平衡感，但他也只敢在拳击场上这么做（being very shy and a thoroughly nice boy, he never fought except in the gym）. 这种自卑感也影响到了他后来的择偶和婚姻——

💧**Clue 1**:   Cohn has been feeling inferior as being Jewish.



**Evidence 1**: He took it out in boxing, and he came out of Princeton with painful self-consciousness and the flattened nose, and was married by the first girl who was nice to him.

他在拳击中发泄这种情绪，他带着痛苦的自我意识和扁平的鼻子离开普林斯顿大学，碰到第一个待他好的姑娘就结了婚。

这个“待他好”的姑娘是否真的如此呢？下文提到了他的婚姻生活并不幸福：(he) hardened into a rather unattractive mould under domestic unhappiness with a rich wife. 这里面有两个细节，首先是他开始变得“冷酷无情，使人讨厌”，其次他们的婚姻不幸还跟他的妻子有钱有关。

需要补充的是，Cohn并不是一个穷小子出身，他的父母都来自非富即贵的显赫家族（through his father, of one of the richest Jewish families in New York, and through his mother of one of the oldest）, 只是他在父亲过世后挥霍无度，最后才变得没剩下几个钱。可以猜想他可能是因为失去家里的财政地位而处处受压制，或者是这个姑娘当初“对他好”只是觊觎他的家庭背景。俩人最后拆伙也非常戏剧化：



**Evidence 2**: As he had been thinking for months about leaving his wife and had not done it because it would be too cruel to deprive her of himself, her departure was a very healthful shock.

他已有好几个月尽考虑着要离开他的妻子，因为觉得使她失去他未免太残酷，所以没有那么做，因此她的出走对他倒是一次很有利的冲击。

Cohn把妻子的离家出走形容为一次“很有利的冲击”（a very healthful shock）, 因为在他看来，自己避免了主动对妻子造成伤害，所以虽然这件事给他带来了一定的影响，他反而觉得是很有益身心的。

在五年的婚姻告终后，他开始利用自己仅剩的积蓄投身到文艺界里。就在他资助一家文艺评论杂志的时候，他又被另一个想从他身上捞好处的女人（Frances）缠住了，后来她还半说服半强制地让Cohn把自己娶回家。但这个女人对他似乎也只有专横和占有欲，为了说明这个，Jake讲了一次三人一起吃饭的经历——



💧**Clue 2**: Frances is in control of Cohn's life.



**Evidence 1**: I suggested we fly to Strasbourg and walk up to Saint Odile, or somewhere or other in Alsace. "I know a girl in Strasbourg who can show us the town," I said. Somebody kicked me under the table.

我建议坐飞机到斯特拉斯堡，从那里步行到圣奥戴尔或者阿尔萨斯地区的什么别的地方。“我在斯特拉斯堡有个熟识的姑娘，她可以带我们观光这座城市，”我说。有人在桌子底下踢了我一脚。



**Evidence 2**: I was kicked again under the table and, looking, saw Frances, Robert's lady, her chin lifting and her face hardening.

在桌子下面我又挨了一脚，我一看，只见弗朗西丝，就是罗伯特的情人，撅着下巴 ，板着面孔呢。

当Jake提到可以让自己认识的一个姑娘作为地陪的时候，Cohn明显非常难紧张，所以连踢了Jake两脚。事后他还向Jake解释说，他无论如何也不能去的。（"It doesn't make any difference. Any girl. I couldn't go, that would be all."）而且不论是怎么样的女孩，都会引起Frances的不悦。（"You don't know Frances. Any girl at all. Didn't you see the way she looked?"）

Cohn是完全在Frances的掌控之中的（had been taken in hand），在他们结婚之前就是如此了，否则Frances也没有办法以自己“姿色日渐衰退”（her looks were going）为借口把自己嫁给Cohn. 所以在Jake看来，Cohn在Frances手里的日子真的很不好过。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧Iceberg Theory 冰山理论**

大多数人第一次读海明威的时候都会觉得故事太过寡淡无味、缺乏引人入胜的悬念，情节似乎也只是人物对话的堆砌。如果你也有这种感觉，那么说明你可能忽略了海明威其实采取了一种很特殊的写作策略，也就是依据所谓的“冰山理论”。

冰山理论（Iceberg Theory）指的是人的语言对于人的思想的表达就好像冰山一样，只有八分之一在水上面，有八分之七在水下；意思是说人的语言是不足以表达思想的，对于作者而言，也没有必要写得太过于直露，因为读者是能读懂的。它还有另一个名称，“省略理论”（Theory of Omission）, 这就已经足够说明了这个理论的目的就在于达成一种“简约艺术”。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/8730e9b8d891b0c896c99da811720df4-sz_74111.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)

但这种省略并不是简单的减少字数，或是刻意删减情节，它是有一定的原则的。海明威在自己的一篇文学评论“The Art of Short Story”里写道：

"A few things I have found to be true. If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened. If you leave or skip something because you do not know it, thestory will be worthless. The test of any story is how very good the stuff that you, not your editors, omit."

“我发现了几件事实：如果作者在作品里省略的是自己已知的信息，那么故事会有一种凝练感。但如果作者只是因为自己无从知晓而省略或跳过，那么故事最终就失去了价值。所以一个故事的好与坏，不在于出版社编辑删掉的那部分有多好，而是作者自己删掉的内容。”

所以关键在于作者要对自己想写的东西心里很有数，这样对于读者来说，只要作家写得真实，会强烈的感觉到他所省略的地方，好像作者已经把他们写出来了似的。

总而言之，“冰山理论”就是用简洁的文字塑造出鲜明的形象，把自身的感受和思想情绪最大限度的埋藏在形象之中，使之情感充沛却含而不露、思想深沉而隐而不晦，而将文学的可感性与可思性巧妙的结合起来，让读者对鲜明形象的感受去发掘作品的思想意义。
