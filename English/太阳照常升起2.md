In the morning it was raining.

A fog had come over the mountains from the sea.

You could not see the tops of the mountains.

The plateau was dull and gloomy, and the shapes of the trees and the houses were changed.

I walked out beyond the town to look at the weather.

The bad weather was coming over the mountains from the sea.

The flags in the square hung wet from the white poles and the banners were wet and hung damp against the front of the houses,

and in between the steady drizzle the rain came down and drove every one under the arcades and made pools of water in the square,

and the streets wet and dark and deserted; yet the fiesta kept up without any pause.

It was only driven under cover.

The covered seats of the bull-ring had been crowded with people sitting out of the rain watching the concourse of Basque and Navarrais dancers and singers,

> ==concourse英 [ˈkɒŋkɔ:s] 美 [ˈkɑ:ŋkɔ:rs] n. 广场；宽敞的大厅；聚集；群众==
>
> n. 〔飞机场或火车站等的〕大厅，大堂（a large hall or open place in a building such as an airport or train station）
>
> 聚集的人群（a large crowd that has gathered together）
>
> 原文：...the concourse of Basque and Navarrais dancers and singers...
>
> 巴斯克和纳瓦拉的舞蹈家和歌唱家们……
>
> 💧concourse 由con (together) 和course (run, come) 构成，也就是指to run/come together. 引申为聚集的人群，相当于throng, crowd; 或聚集的场所（尤其是火车站和飞机场）。

and afterward the Val Carlos dancers in their costumes danced down the street in the rain, the drums sounding hollow and damp, and the chiefs of the bands riding ahead on their big, heavy-footed horses, their costumes wet, the horses' coats wet in the rain.

The crowd was in the cafés and the dancers came in, too, and sat, their tight-wound white legs under the tables, shaking the water from their belled caps, and spreading their red and purple jackets over the chairs to dry.

It was raining hard outside.

I left the crowd in the café and went over to the hotel to get shaved for dinner.

I was shaving in my room when there was a knock on the door.

"Come in," I called. Montoya walked in.

"How are you?" he said.

"Fine," I said.

"No bulls to-day." "No," I said, "nothing but rain."

"Where are your friends?"

"Over at the Iruña."

Montoya smiled his embarrassed smile.

"Look," he said. "Do you know the American ambassador?"

"Yes," I said. "Everybody knows the American ambassador."

"He's here in town, now."

"Yes," I said. "Everybody's seen them."

"I've seen them, too," Montoya said.

He didn't say anything. I went on shaving.

"Sit down," I said. "Let me send for a drink." "No, I have to go."

I finished shaving and put my face down into the bowl and washed it with cold water.

Montoya was standing there looking more embarrassed.

"Look," he said. "I've just had a message from them at the Grand Hotel that they want Pedro Romero and Marcial Lalanda to come over for coffee to-night after dinner."

> <font color=red>"I've just had a message from them at the Grand Hotel that they want Pedro Romero and Marcial Lalanda to come over for coffee to-night after dinner."</font>

> **💧知识拓展**

> Marcial Lalanda（1903-1990）是一个真实的人物。他是当时西班牙著名的斗牛士，职业全盛期在1930前后，深得海明威喜爱。这里海明威有意把他和虚构的Romero的相提并论，也是为了增强故事的真实感。
>
> *them at the Grand Hotel 指下榻在大饭店的从美国来的大使："Yes," I said. "Everybody knows the American ambassador." "He's here in town, now."

"Well," I said, "it can't hurt Marcial any."

"Marcial has been in San Sebastian all day.

He drove over in a car this morning with Marquez. I don't think they'll be back tonight."

Montoya stood embarrassed. He wanted me to say something.

"Don't give Romero the message," I said.

"You think so?" "Absolutely."

Montoya was very pleased.

"I wanted to ask you because you were an American," he said.

"That's what I'd do."

"Look," said Montoya. "People take a boy like that.

They don't know what he's worth. They don't know what he means.

Any foreigner can flatter him.

They start this Grand Hotel business, and in one year they're through."

> <font color=red>"Any foreigner can flatter him. They start this Grand Hotel business, and in one year they're through."</font>
>
> “任何一个外国人都可以来捧他。他们从‘大饭店’喝杯咖啡开始，一年后，他们就把他彻底毁了。”
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①the Grand Hotel business 也就是指以邀请斗牛士去喝咖啡为打头。
>
> ②they're through 完整的意思应该是they're through with him (Romero). be through with sb/sth 表示“完成某事；用完某物；和某人关系终结”。这里指他们把Romero利用完就会弃之不顾。

"Like Algabeno," I said.

"Yes, like Algabeno."

"They're a fine lot," I said. "There's one American woman down here now that collects bull-fighters."

"I know. They only want the young ones."

"Yes," I said. "The old ones get fat."

"Or crazy like Gallo."

"Well," I said, "it's easy. All you have to do is not give him the message."

"He's such a fine boy," said Montoya. "He ought to stay with his own people. He shouldn't mix in that stuff."

"Won't you have a drink?" I asked.

"No," said Montoya, "I have to go." He went out.

I went down-stairs and out the door and took a walk around through the arcades around the square.

It was still raining. I looked in at the Iruña for the gang and they were not there, so I walked on around the square and back to the hotel.

They were eating dinner in the down-stairs dining-room.

They were well ahead of me and it was no use trying to catch them.

Bill was buying shoe-shines for Mike.

Bootblacks opened the street door and each one Bill called over and started to work on Mike.

"This is the eleventh time my boots have been polished," Mike said. "I say, Bill is an ass."

The bootblacks had evidently spread the report. Another came in.

"Limpia botas ([西]要擦靴子吗)?" he said to Bill.

"No," said Bill. "For this Señor ([西]先生)."

The bootblack knelt down beside the one at work and started on Mike's free shoe that shone already in the electric light.

"Bill's a yell of laughter," Mike said.

I was drinking red wine, and so far behind them that I felt a little uncomfortable about all this shoe-shining.

I looked around the room. At the next table was Pedro Romero.

He stood up when I nodded, and asked me to come over and meet a friend.

His table was beside ours, almost touching.

I met the friend, a Madrid bullfight critic, a little man with a drawn face.

I told Romero how much I liked his work, and he was very pleased.

We talked Spanish and the critic knew a little French.

I reached to our table for my winebottle, but the critic took my arm. Romero laughed.

"Drink here," he said in English.

He was very bashful about his English, but he was really very pleased with it, and as we went on talking he brought out words he was not sure of, and asked me about them.

> ==bashful==
>
> adj. 忸怩；羞怯的；局促不安的（shy and easily embarrassed）
>
> 原文：He was very bashful about his English, but he was really very pleased with it...
>
> 他说起英语来很腼腆，但是他打心眼儿里乐意说英语……
>
> 💧bashful 表示“（在社交场合）困窘的”，它的动词形式是abash “使困窘，羞愧”（to cause to feel ill at ease）. bashful也就是to be abashed. 比如：Don’t be bashful about telling people how you feel.
>
> 不要羞于说出自己的感受。

He was anxious to know the English for Corrida de toros, the exact translation.

Bull-fight he was suspicious of.

>
> corrida在西语里是running的意思（作名词），de相当于英语里的of，toros也就是bulls，连起来Corrida de toros就是the running of the bulls的意思，因此这个评论家觉得翻译成bull-fight是不够恰当的。

I explained that bull-fight in Spanish was the lidia of a toro.

The Spanish word corrida means in English the running of bulls — the French translation is Course de taureaux.

> 我解释说，bull-fight在西班牙语中意为对toro的lidia. Corrida这西班牙语词在英语中意为“牛群的奔驰”——法语是Course de taureaux.
>
> **💧知识拓展**
>
> Jake肯定了这位评论家的看法。英文里的bull-fight在西班牙语里其实是the lidia of a toro（和牛的搏击/搏斗），lidia也就是fight，这和原本的Corrida de toros表达的“牛群的奔驰”意思不一样。但这个词在法语里的翻译是准确的（Course de taureaux），所以他们得出来的结论就是英语里没有和Corrida de toros准确对应的词。

The critic put that in. There is no Spanish word for bull-fight.

Pedro Romero said he had learned a little English in Gibraltar.

He was born in Ronda.

That is not far above Gibraltar.

He started bull-fighting in Malaga in the bull-fighting school there.

He had only been at it three years.

The bull-fight critic joked him about the number of Malagueno expressions he used.

He was nineteen years old, he said.

His older brother was with him as a banderillero (短枪手，斗牛士助手), but he did not live in this hotel.

He lived in a smaller hotel with the other people who worked for Romero.

He asked me how many times I had seen him in the ring. I told him only three.

It was really only two, but I did not want to explain after I had made the mistake.

"Where did you see me the other time? In Madrid?"

"Yes," I lied. I had read the accounts of his two appearances in Madrid in the bull-fight papers, so I was all right.

"The first or the second time?" "The first."

"I was very bad," he said. "The second time I was better. You remember?" He turned to the critic.

He was not at all embarrassed.

He talked of his work as something altogether apart from himself.

There was nothing conceited or braggartly about him.

> ==conceited英 [kənˈsi:tɪd] 美 [kənˈsitɪd] adj. （人）自负的，自高自大的，骄傲自满的==
>
> ==braggartly英 [b'ræɡətlɪ] 美 [b'ræɡətlɪ] 　 adv. 自夸地==

"I like it very much that you like my work," he said. "But you haven't seen it yet.

To-morrow, if I get a good bull, I will try and show it to you."

When he said this he smiled, anxious that neither the bull-fight critic nor I would think he was boasting.

"I am anxious to see it," the critic said. "I would like to be convinced."

"He doesn't like my work much." Romero turned to me. He was serious.

The critic explained that he liked it very much, but that so far it had been incomplete.

"Wait till to-morrow, if a good one comes out."

"Have you seen the bulls for to-morrow?" the critic asked me.

"Yes. I saw them unloaded."

Pedro Romero leaned forward.

"What did you think of them?"

"Very nice," I said. "About twenty-sixarrobas. Very short horns. Haven't you seen them?"

"Oh, yes," said Romero.

"They won't weigh twenty-six arrobas," said the critic.

"Oh, yes," said Romero. "They won'tweigh twenty-six arrobas," said the critic.

"You call them bananas?" asked Romero. He turned to me and smiled.

"You wouldn't call them bananas?"

"No," I said. "They're horns all right."

"They're very short," said Pedro Romero. "Very, very short. Still, theyaren't bananas."

"I say, Jake," Brett called from the next table, "you have deserted us."

"Just temporarily," I said. "We're talking bulls."

"You are superior."

"Tell him that bulls have no balls," Mike shouted. He was drunk.

Romero looked at me inquiringly.

> ==inquiringly英 [ɪnk'waɪərɪŋlɪ] 美 [ɪnk'waɪərɪŋlɪ] 　adv. 诧异地==

"Drunk," I said. "Borracho! Muy borracho! ([西]醉了！完全是醉了！)"

"You might introduce your friends," Brett said.

She had not stopped looking at Pedro Romero.

I asked them if they would like to have coffee with us.

They both stood up. Romero's face was very brown.

He had very nice manners.

### 背景知识

**💧西班牙的传统服饰**

虽然阴雨连绵，但狂欢节依然在继续。这天大家都坐在斗牛场上看来自巴斯克和纳瓦拉的舞蹈家和歌唱家们表演节目（people sitting out of the rain watching the concourse of Basque and Navarrais dancers and singers）, 还有卡洛斯谷的艺术家们冒雨赶来，身上的服侍都被淋湿了（their costumes wet）.

他们的脚缠着白色的绑腿（tight-wound white legs），小帽上系着铃铛（belled caps），外衣也都是姹紫嫣红的（red and purple jackets）.

其实西班牙的传统服饰还不仅于此，由于不同文化、气候和地理条件的影响，各个民族和地区的服装都别具特色，而且还与宗教、舞蹈和斗牛有着密切的关系。但是随着时代的发展，只能在一些传统节日庆祝活动、舞蹈、戏剧，或一些旅游点的传统节目表演中看到这些服装了。从风格上讲，北方地区比较朴素，色调以灰黑白为主，而南方则艳丽夸张，热情奔放。

下面我们来具体了解一些地区的传统服饰：

\1. 塞维利亚传统服装

紧身的裙子，大波浪般的裙摆，头顶上的鲜花，这就是来自西班牙弗拉门戈舞的服装，起源可追溯至古代的罗姆人（也称为吉普赛人），大约定型于19世纪初。通常女性手中还会持一把精致的小扇子。



\2. 吉普斯夸传统服装

当地的传统服装灵感来自农村活动中的礼服，红色和黑色是基调，女士佩戴白色头巾；男士则戴红色贝雷帽。



\3. 坎塔布里亚传统服装

该地区的传统服装诞生于西班牙的18世纪，流行于北部的桑坦德地区，特点之一是女性的裙摆非常宽松，长至脚踝，群内有多层内衬用于支撑裙摆，肩部佩戴三角形披肩，头上戴各色头巾；而男性服装则简单的多，通常是衬衫、马甲、外套以及腰部的布面腰带，而三角锥形的帽子则是男装的一大特色。



\4. 加泰罗尼亚民族服装

据说加泰罗尼亚地区的传统服装代表了当地两个历史人物：Hereus和Pubillas，Hereus是当地农民家庭的女继承人，而Pubillas则是男继承人——这种说法起源于20世纪初期的加泰罗尼亚地区传统的农村家庭的联姻制度。女装一般是白色蕾丝披肩配黑色上衣及花裙；男士则更简单，穿着白衬衫、黑马甲和黑裤，男装还可以加上一件直到脚踝的长袍。

### 课文理解

今天我们进入到了全新的一个章节，在昨天的内容里本书的最后一位角色已经登场——Romero. 接着我们也会看到作者如何安排这些人的行动来制造冲突，从而达到小说的高潮。首先今天的情节里有一个铺垫，Montoya请Jake帮了一个忙，也就是不要让从美国来的大使们见到Romero，从中可以看出Montoya担任的是Romero的mentor的角色（mentor可以理解为“导师”或是“看护人”）——

💧**Clue 1**: Montoya serves as the mentor of Romero.



**Evidence 1**: "Look," said Montoya. "People take a boy like that. They don't know what he's worth. They don't know what he means..."

“你看。”蒙托亚说。“人们竟然这样糊弄孩子。他们不懂得他的价值。他们不懂得他对我们意味着什么。”



**Evidence 2**: "He's such a fine boy," said Montoya. "He ought to stay with his own people. He shouldn't mix in that stuff."

“他是个多好的小伙啊。”蒙托亚说。“他应该同自己的人民在一起。他不该参与这种事儿。”



Montoya首先是试探性地和Jake说了这件事，没想到Jake和他的想法一致，他们都认为应该保护Romero的纯真性。所以Montoya在这里有点把Romero托付给Jake的意味，他愿意把Jake介绍给Romero是出于他对Jake的信任和崇敬（我们在前面分析过Montoya对于真正热爱斗牛的人格外亲近），所以希望Jake可以尽量保护Montoya不要受到坏的影响（尤其是在和外国人接触的时候）。

Jake虽然在这里表示了同意（"Well," I said, "it's easy. All you have to do is not give him the message."）但他很快就会打破这个约定，而且他带到Romero身边的，是更危险的一样东西。

随后Jake在酒店的餐厅里遇上Romero，便和Romero以及他的一位评论家朋友一起同桌。Romero在这个过程中表现得非常彬彬有礼（He had very nice manners）——



💧**Clue 2**: Romero has good breeding.



**Evidence 1**: "They've got bananas for horns," the critic said.

"You call them bananas?" asked Romero. He turned to me and smiled. "You w ouldn't call them bananas?"

“它们头上长的是香蕉，不是牛角。”评论家说。

“你管那些叫香蕉？”罗梅罗问。他朝我笑笑。“你不会管牛角叫香蕉吧？”



**Evidence 2**: "No," I said. "They're horns all right."

"They're very short," said Pedro Romero. "Very, very short. Still, they aren't bananas."

“不。”我说。“牛角总归是牛角。”

“它们很短，”罗梅罗说。“非常非常短。不过，他们可不是香蕉。”



面对这位评论家非常无礼地把牛角说成是香蕉，Romero没有直接反驳，而是先征求Jake的意见，并且面带微笑地不露丝毫愠色，这都说明了他有非常良好的教养。

这时候，Brett主动要求Jake把Romero介绍给她（"You might introduce your friends," Brett said. She had not stopped looking at Pedro Romero）. Jake没有拒绝，是因为他忘记了Montoya的嘱托还是另有所想？和Brett的接触又会对Romero产生什么样的影响？在接下来的故事里我们会看到伴随着冲突升级的还有对各个人物隐藏面的揭露。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧English vocabulary derived from Spanish**

**来自西班牙语的英语词汇**



我们都知道英语受法语、拉丁语影响很大，其实西班牙语对英语的影响也不容忽视，特别是近现代。由于美国特殊的历史因素和地理位置，每年都会有大量的拉美人（Hispanic or Latin American or Latino） 移民、旅游、偷渡到美国，对美国的文化尤其是语言产生了很大影响，他们向美语引入了大量西班牙语词汇（比如我们之前介绍的fiesta表示“狂欢节”以及aficionado表示“狂热爱好者”也都是从西语进入英语的）。

以及昨天的内容里提到的picador（长矛手）和matador（主斗牛士）都来源于西班牙语词，其中matador来源于西班牙语动词matar，意为“杀”。还有一些非常简单的单词例如banana，potato，tomato，chocolate也都来源于西班牙语。

下面我们就来看一下英语中还有哪些来源于西班牙语的词汇~



\1. amigo 朋友（超级超级常用的词汇！）

Your time will be come, amigo.

你的时代会到来的，朋友。



\2. burrito 玉米煎饼

Mexican chicken burrito 也就是墨西哥鸡肉卷（去过肯德基的人应该都知道），它的外层就是用玉米煎饼做的，所以名字里有个burrito.

Upon my arrival at the hotel, I went straight to the bar and gorged on a chicken burrito with huge wedge potato fries. 

来到旅馆之后，我就直奔这家酒吧，品尝了一份墨西哥鸡肉卷和大号薯条。



\3. caballero 骑士

这个词来源于非常著名的西班牙作家塞万提斯)（Cervantes）写的小说《堂吉诃德》（*Don Quixote*）中骑士的形象。

Become the caballero or bow hand with illustrious reputation! 

成为声名赫赫的骑手或者弓箭手！



\4. cargo 货物，船货

来源于动词中cargar，意思是装载货物。

The crew lashed down the cargo on the fore deck. 

船员们把前甲板上的货物捆牢了。



\5. guerrilla 游击战，游击队员

来自西班牙语名词guerra，为“战争warfare”的意思。

 The guerrillas threatened to kill their hostages. 

 游击队员们威胁要杀死人质。



\6. crusade 改革运动, 十字军东征

来源于西班牙语cruzado，意味“交叉的”。

My crusade to inspire will continue whether people think it’s possible or not. 

无论人们认为可能与否，我的改革运动都不会停止。



\7. tornado 旋风

来源于西班牙语词汇tornar，意味“扭转”。

The tornado rubbished the whole village. 

龙卷风毁掉了整个村庄。

I introduced them all around and they started to sit down, but there was not enough room, so we all moved over to the big table by the wall to have coffee.

Mike ordered a bottle of Fundador and glasses for everybody.

There was a lot of drunken talking.

"Tell him I think writing is lousy," Bill said. "Go on, tell him. Tell him I'm ashamed of being a writer."

Pedro Romero was sitting beside Brett and listening to her.

"Go on. Tell him!" Bill said.

Romero looked up smiling.

"This gentleman," I said, "is a writer."

Romero was impressed.

"This other one, too," I said, pointing at Cohn.

"He looks like Villalta," Romero said,looking at Bill.

"Rafael, doesn't he look like Villalta?"

"I can't see it," the critic said.

"Really," Romero said in Spanish. "He looks a lot like Villalta. What does the drunken one do?"

"Nothing." "Is that why he drinks?"

"No. He's waiting to marry this lady."

"Tell him bulls have no balls!" Mike shouted, very drunk, from the other end of the table.

"What does he say?" "He's drunk."

"Jake," Mike called. "Tell him bulls have no balls!"

"You understand?" I said."Yes."

I was sure he didn't, so it was all right.

"Tell him Brett wants to see him puton those green pants."

"Pipe down, Mike." "Tell him Brett is dying to know how he can get into those pants." "Pipe down."

During this Romero was fingering his glass and talking with Brett.

Brett was talking French and he was talking Spanish and a little English, and laughing.

Bill was filling the glasses.

"Tell him Brett wants to come into — "

"Oh, pipe down, Mike, for Christ's sake!"

Romero looked up smiling.

"Pipe down! I know that," he said.

Just then Montoya came into the room.

He started to smile at me, then he saw Pedro Romero with a big glass of cognac in his hand, sitting laughing between me and a woman with bare shoulders, at a table full of drunks. He did not even nod.

Montoya went out of the room.

Mike was on his feet proposing a toast.

>
> ②propose a toast 指“祝酒”，如果表示“向某人”只需要加上to, 比如：I’d like to propose a toast to the bride and groom.（我提议为新郎新娘干杯。） 

"Let's all drink to — " he began.

"Pedro Romero," I said.

Everybody stood up.

Romero took it very seriously, and we touched glasses and drank it down, I rushing it a little because Mike was trying to make it clear that that was not at all what he was going to drink to.

But it went off all right, and Pedro Romero shook hands with every one and he and the critic went out together.

"My God! he's a lovely boy," Brett said. "And how I would love to see him get into those clothes. He must use a shoe-horn."

"I started to tell him," Mike began. "And Jake kept interrupting me. Why do you interrupt me? Do you think you talk Spanish better than I do?"

"Oh, shut up, Mike! Nobody interrupted you."

"No, I'd like to get this settled." He turned away from me. "Do you think you amount to something, Cohn? Do you think you belong here among us?

> <font color=red>"Do you think you amount to something, Cohn?"</font>
>
> “你以为你有什么了不起吗，科恩？”
>

>
> amount to something 也就是“算个人物，有点了不起”（形容某人是something其实就是说这个人有点来头的意思）。另外not amount to much/anything这个表达也就可以用来形容一个人没出息，比如：Jim’s never going to amount to much.（吉姆永远不会有多大出息。） 

People who are out to have a good time? For God's sake don't be so noisy, Cohn!"

"Oh, cut it out, Mike," Cohn said.

"Do you think Brett wants you here?Do you think you add to the party? Why don't you say something?"

>
> 这里的add to the party可以理解为“给聚会带来乐子、助兴”或者是“给聚会增色”。

"I said all I had to say the other night, Mike."

"I'm not one of you literary chaps." Mike stood shakily and leaned against the table.

> ==shakily英 ['ʃeɪkɪlɪ] 美 ['ʃeɪkɪlɪ] adv. 颤抖着；摇晃地；发抖地；不坚定地==

"I'm not clever. But I do know when I'm not wanted.

Why don't you see when you're not wanted, Cohn?

Go away. Go away, for God's sake. Take that sad Jewish face away.

Don't you think I'm right?" He looked at us.

"Sure," I said. "Let's all go over to the Irufla."

"No. Don't you think I'm right? I love that woman."

"Oh, don't start that again. Do shove it along, Michael," Brett said.

"Don't you think I'm right, Jake?"

Cohn still sat at the table.

His face had the sallow, yellow look it got when he was insulted, but somehow he seemed to be enjoying it.

The childish, drunken heroics of it.

> ==heroic英 [həˈrəʊɪk] 美 [həˈroʊɪk] adj. 有英雄气概的，英雄的，英勇的；记叙英雄及其事迹的；夸张的 n. 英雄诗，史诗；英勇行为；夸张的言行；咬文嚼字，文诌诌==

It was his affair with a lady of title.

"Jake," Mike said. He was almost crying. "You know I'm right. Listen, you!"

He turned to Cohn: "Go away! Go away now!"

"But I won't go, Mike," said Cohn.

"Then I'll make you!" Mike started toward him around the table.

Cohn stood up and took off his glasses.

He stood waiting, his face sallow, his hands fairly low, proudly and firmly waiting for the assault, ready to do battle for his lady love.

> ==assault英 [əˈsɔ:lt] 美 [əˈsɔlt] n. 攻击；袭击，进攻；威胁，殴打；侵犯人身 vt. 袭击；强暴；使（感官）难受==

>
> 💧assault 还可以引申为“抨击”：under assault表示“受到抨击”，比如：Traditional family values are increasingly under assault. 
>
> 传统的家庭价值观日益受到抨击。

I grabbed Mike. "Come on to the café," I said. "You can't hit him herein the hotel."

"Good!" said Mike. "Good idea!"

We started off.

I looked back as Mike stumbled up the stairs and saw Cohn putting his glasses on again.

Bill was sitting at the table pouring another glass of Fundador.

Brett was sitting looking straight ahead at nothing.

Outside on the square it had stopped raining and the moon was trying to get through the clouds.

There was a wind blowing.

The military band was playing and the crowd was massed on the far side of the square where the fireworks specialist and his son were trying to send up fire balloons.

A balloon would start up jerkily, on a great bias, and be torn by the wind or blown against the houses of the square.

> ①start up jerkily “一蹦一蹦地往上窜”； start在这里指“（像受到惊吓一样）突然跳起，蹦起”（to move suddenly）, 相当于jump的意思，start up也就是往上跳，窜；jerkily形容“颠簸地，不平稳地”（roughly, with many starts and stops）;
>
> ②on a great bias “以大幅度的斜线”，bias常见有“偏见”（prejudice）的意思，但on the biad表示的是“偏斜地，成对角地”（in a diagonal direction）. 这里形容的就是气球不是竖直上升，而是大幅度地斜着往上窜。

There was no one dancing in the square. The gravel was too wet.

Brett came out with Bill and joined us.

We stood in the crowd and watched Don Manuel Orquito, the fireworks king, standing on a little platform, carefully starting the balloons with sticks, standing above the heads of the crowd to launch the balloons off into the wind.

The wind brought them all down, and Don Manuel Orquito's face was sweaty in the light of his complicated fireworks that fell into the crowd and charged and chased,sputtering and cracking, between the legs of the people.

"They're razzing Don Manuel," Bill said.

"How do you know he's Don Manuel?" Brett said.

"His name's on the programme. DonManuel Orquito, the pirotecnico of esta ciudad ([西]本城的焰火师)."

"Globos illuminados ([西]照明气球，焰火气球)," Mike said. "A collection of globos illuminados. That's what the paper said."

The wind blew the band music away.

"I say, I wish one would go up," Brett said. "That Don Manuel chap is furious."

"He's probably worked for weeks fixing them to go off, spelling out 'Hail to San Fermin,' " Bill said.

"Globos illuminados," Mike said. "A bunch of bloody globos illuminados."

"Come on," said Brett. "We can't stand here."

"Her ladyship wants a drink," Mike said.

"How you know things," Brett said.

Inside, the café was crowded and very noisy.

No one noticed us come in.

We could not find a table.

There was a great noise going on.

"Come on, let's get out of here," Billsaid.

Outside the paseo was going in under the arcade.

There were some English and Americans from Biarritz in sport clothes scattered at the tables.

Some of the women stared at the people going by with lorgnons.

We had acquired, at some time, a friend of Bill's from Biarritz.

She was staying with another girl at the Grand Hotel.

The other girl had a headache and had gone to bed.

"Here's the pub," Mike said.

It was the Bar Milano, a small, tough bar where you could get food and where they danced in the back room.

We all sat down at a table and ordered a bottle of Fundador.

The bar was not full.

There was nothing going on.

"This is a hell of a place," Bill said.

"It's too early."

"Let's take the bottle and come back later," Bill said. "I don't want tosit here on a night like this."

"Let's go and look at the English," Mike said. "I love to look at the English."

"They're awful," Bill said. "Where did they all come from?"

"They come from Biarritz," Mike said. "They come to see the last day of the quaint little Spanish fiesta."

"I'll festa them," Bill said.

"You're an extraordinarily beautiful girl." Mike turned to Bill's friend. "When did you come here?"

"Come off it, Michael."

"I say, she is a lovely girl. Where have I been?

"Where have I been looking all this while?

"You're a lovely thing. Have we met?

"Come along with me and Bill. We're going to festa the English."

"I'll festa them," Bill said. "What the hell are they doing at this fiesta?"

"Come on," Mike said. "Just us three. We're going to festa the bloody English.

"I hope you're not English?

"I'm Scotch. I hate the English.

"I'm going to festa them. Come on, Bill."

### 背景知识

**💧Why does Scottish do not like to be called the English？**

**苏格兰人为什么不喜欢被称为英国人**

Mike said. "Just us three. We're going to festa the bloody English. I hope you're not English? I'm Scotch. I hate the English..."

在今天的最后一段话中Mike说道：“就我们三个人。我们领这帮该死的英国佬看热闹去。希望你不是英国人。我是苏格兰人。我讨厌英国人。” 

从Mike的言语和语气中我们可以看出身为苏格兰人的Mike对于English称呼的鄙视。English一般指英格兰人，下面我们一起了解一下苏格兰和英格兰有什么恩恩怨怨。

英国全称为大不列颠及北爱尔兰联合王国（The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland），由英格兰（England）、威尔士（Wales）、苏格兰（Scotland） 和北爱尔兰（Northern Ireland）组成，而整个英国的历史也就是由这四个区域的历史交织组成。这个联邦制国家除了都支持君主立宪制，他们在语言、文化、传统甚至法律上都存在一定差别，苏格兰与英格兰的恩怨纠葛由来已久，他们谁都不服谁。

公元前54年，罗马帝国( Roman Empire ) 军队渡过英吉利海峡（the English Channel ），入侵不列颠岛，那时候的不列颠岛上居住的是凯尔特人(Celtic)，跟精锐的罗马军队相比，基本就是原始人( primitive people). 罗马人打败了凯尔特人，但是由于苏格兰地形复杂，民风彪悍，不好管理，于是罗马放弃了苏格兰，而是改为在英格兰、苏格兰交界的地方修长城。

公元11世纪，邓肯一世继承了苏格兰地区的王国的王位，没多久又被麦克白推翻，过了十几年，邓肯一世的儿子马尔康姆三世复仇，重登大宝。（这就是莎士比亚悲剧《麦克白》(*Macbeth*) 的故事原型）。

反应苏格兰反英战争最有影响力的电影：《勇敢的心》

在苏格兰与英格兰的历史恩怨中，最广为人知的就是13-14世纪的苏格兰抗英战争了，这极大程度上要归功于美国电影《勇敢的心》，以苏格兰历史上的传奇英雄威廉·华莱士为原型，他这场战争中率领起义军奋起反抗英军，并在1305年被杀害。在1314年大胜英格兰国王爱德华二世以后，苏格兰恢复了事实上的独立。

不过16到17世纪间，苏格兰与英格兰之间的关系也谈不上多好，比如克伦威尔在1650年又率领英格兰军队再次攻占苏格兰。只是在1660年查理二世复辟以后，苏格兰才自动恢复了独立地位，直到1707年与英格兰在保持王位联合基础的情况下，和平完成合并。

图：克伦威尔完成了英格兰历史上最后一次对苏格兰的武力征服

从1688年起，苏格兰又被英格兰拖入多场战争，更是彻底失去了法国、荷兰等市场。

1707年的合并，实际上是苏格兰王国在万般无奈的情况下以出卖自身独立性——不再保留独立国家。事实上在1703-1704年，苏格兰和英格兰之间的关系还一度极为紧张，几乎再次处于战争边缘。

苏格兰和英格兰的恩怨由来已久，当我们询问一个人是不是英国人的时候，我们可以问Are you British? 来避免尴尬。

### 课文理解

Jake把Romero介绍给了Mike和Brett, 但Mike开始醉态百出胡言乱语，Romero则和Brett相谈甚欢。结果这一幕被正好走进来的Montoya看见了。我们昨天提到过，Montoya出于信任把Romero托付给Jake, 不希望他和外国人搅和在一块，但今天他明显对于Jake破坏约定十分不悦——

💧**Clue 1**: Montoya is angry with Jake's betrayal.



**Evidence 1**: He started to smile at me, then he saw Pedro Romero with a big glass of cognac in his hand, sitting laughing between me and a woman with bare shoulders, at a table full of drunks. He did not even nod.

他正要朝我微笑，但是看见了佩德罗·罗梅罗手里拿着一大杯白兰地，坐在我和一个肩膀袒露的女人之间哈哈大笑，同桌的都是醉汉。他甚至连头也没点一下。



当然这一个场景惹怒的不只是Montoya, Mike虽然心里醋意横生，但他除了嘲讽Romero几句（"Tell him Brett wants to see him put on those green pants."）并没有胆量直接和他挑明（可能是出于自卑的心理），转而把怒火发泄在了Cohn身上（"No, I'd like to get this settled." He turned away from me. "Do you think you amount to something, Cohn? Do you think you belong here among us? People who are out to have a good time? For God's sake don't be so noisy, Cohn!"）



这一次Cohn没有闷声不吭，相反地，他甚至为此感到得意并且随时准备好要跟Mike干一架——



💧**Clue 2**: Cohn takes pleasure in his affair with Brett and ready to fight with Mike.



**Evidence 1**: Cohn still sat at the table. His face had the sallow, yellow look it got when he was insulted, but somehow he seemed to be enjoying it. The childish, drunken heroics of it. It was his affair with a lady of title.

科恩仍在桌边坐着。他每逢受到侮辱，脸色就变得蜡黄，但是他似乎也有点自得其乐。酒后夸夸其谈的蠢话。和他发生关系的可是一位有头衔的夫人。



**Evidence 2**: Cohn stood up and took off his glasses. He stood waiting, his face sallow, his hands fairly low, proudly and firmly waiting for the assault, ready to do battle for his lady love.

科恩站起来，摘下眼镜。他站着等待，脸色蜡黄，放低双手，骄傲而毅然地迎候攻击，准备为心上人作一番奋战。



作者在这里调侃了Cohn身上那种过时的骑士精神——“chivalry”（the medieval system, principles, and customs of knighthood）. 这种精神在中世纪被认为是贵族的一种高尚品格，它的核心就是：遵循社会规则，关爱自己和他人，尤其是敢于为自己心爱的女人奉献。



在本书开头的时候作者就给我们埋下了这个伏笔：当时Cohn在看一本叫作《紫色大地》（The Purple Land）的书，这本书里的主角就是一个四处和貌美的女郎们浪漫冒险的英国绅士（Cohn深受影响，因此还想要到南美去一趟）。



所以面对Mike的斥责，Cohn反而觉得自己是在光荣地为了Brett忍辱负重，甚至愿意和Mike公开对战（ready to do battle for his lady love）. 这种逞装英雄的自我陶醉在旁人看来其实可笑无比，虽然Mike醉得糊涂，但他有一句话却道出了事实，也就是Cohn很多时候都没有自知之明（"I'm not clever. But I do know when I'm not wanted. Why don't you see when you're not wanted, Cohn?"）接下来的情节马上就会证明他对Brett其实只是一厢情愿。
