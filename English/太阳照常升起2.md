In the morning it was raining.

A fog had come over the mountains from the sea.

You could not see the tops of the mountains.

The plateau was dull and gloomy, and the shapes of the trees and the houses were changed.

I walked out beyond the town to look at the weather.

The bad weather was coming over the mountains from the sea.

The flags in the square hung wet from the white poles and the banners were wet and hung damp against the front of the houses,

and in between the steady drizzle the rain came down and drove every one under the arcades and made pools of water in the square,

and the streets wet and dark and deserted; yet the fiesta kept up without any pause.

It was only driven under cover.

The covered seats of the bull-ring had been crowded with people sitting out of the rain watching the concourse of Basque and Navarrais dancers and singers,

> ==concourse英 [ˈkɒŋkɔ:s] 美 [ˈkɑ:ŋkɔ:rs] n. 广场；宽敞的大厅；聚集；群众==
>
> n. 〔飞机场或火车站等的〕大厅，大堂（a large hall or open place in a building such as an airport or train station）
>
> 聚集的人群（a large crowd that has gathered together）
>
> 原文：...the concourse of Basque and Navarrais dancers and singers...
>
> 巴斯克和纳瓦拉的舞蹈家和歌唱家们……
>
> 💧concourse 由con (together) 和course (run, come) 构成，也就是指to run/come together. 引申为聚集的人群，相当于throng, crowd; 或聚集的场所（尤其是火车站和飞机场）。

and afterward the Val Carlos dancers in their costumes danced down the street in the rain, the drums sounding hollow and damp, and the chiefs of the bands riding ahead on their big, heavy-footed horses, their costumes wet, the horses' coats wet in the rain.

The crowd was in the cafés and the dancers came in, too, and sat, their tight-wound white legs under the tables, shaking the water from their belled caps, and spreading their red and purple jackets over the chairs to dry.

It was raining hard outside.

I left the crowd in the café and went over to the hotel to get shaved for dinner.

I was shaving in my room when there was a knock on the door.

"Come in," I called. Montoya walked in.

"How are you?" he said.

"Fine," I said.

"No bulls to-day." "No," I said, "nothing but rain."

"Where are your friends?"

"Over at the Iruña."

Montoya smiled his embarrassed smile.

"Look," he said. "Do you know the American ambassador?"

"Yes," I said. "Everybody knows the American ambassador."

"He's here in town, now."

"Yes," I said. "Everybody's seen them."

"I've seen them, too," Montoya said.

He didn't say anything. I went on shaving.

"Sit down," I said. "Let me send for a drink." "No, I have to go."

I finished shaving and put my face down into the bowl and washed it with cold water.

Montoya was standing there looking more embarrassed.

"Look," he said. "I've just had a message from them at the Grand Hotel that they want Pedro Romero and Marcial Lalanda to come over for coffee to-night after dinner."

> <font color=red>"I've just had a message from them at the Grand Hotel that they want Pedro Romero and Marcial Lalanda to come over for coffee to-night after dinner."</font>

> **💧知识拓展**

> Marcial Lalanda（1903-1990）是一个真实的人物。他是当时西班牙著名的斗牛士，职业全盛期在1930前后，深得海明威喜爱。这里海明威有意把他和虚构的Romero的相提并论，也是为了增强故事的真实感。
>
> *them at the Grand Hotel 指下榻在大饭店的从美国来的大使："Yes," I said. "Everybody knows the American ambassador." "He's here in town, now."

"Well," I said, "it can't hurt Marcial any."

"Marcial has been in San Sebastian all day.

He drove over in a car this morning with Marquez. I don't think they'll be back tonight."

Montoya stood embarrassed. He wanted me to say something.

"Don't give Romero the message," I said.

"You think so?" "Absolutely."

Montoya was very pleased.

"I wanted to ask you because you were an American," he said.

"That's what I'd do."

"Look," said Montoya. "People take a boy like that.

They don't know what he's worth. They don't know what he means.

Any foreigner can flatter him.

They start this Grand Hotel business, and in one year they're through."

> <font color=red>"Any foreigner can flatter him. They start this Grand Hotel business, and in one year they're through."</font>
>
> “任何一个外国人都可以来捧他。他们从‘大饭店’喝杯咖啡开始，一年后，他们就把他彻底毁了。”
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①the Grand Hotel business 也就是指以邀请斗牛士去喝咖啡为打头。
>
> ②they're through 完整的意思应该是they're through with him (Romero). be through with sb/sth 表示“完成某事；用完某物；和某人关系终结”。这里指他们把Romero利用完就会弃之不顾。

"Like Algabeno," I said.

"Yes, like Algabeno."

"They're a fine lot," I said. "There's one American woman down here now that collects bull-fighters."

"I know. They only want the young ones."

"Yes," I said. "The old ones get fat."

"Or crazy like Gallo."

"Well," I said, "it's easy. All you have to do is not give him the message."

"He's such a fine boy," said Montoya. "He ought to stay with his own people. He shouldn't mix in that stuff."

"Won't you have a drink?" I asked.

"No," said Montoya, "I have to go." He went out.

I went down-stairs and out the door and took a walk around through the arcades around the square.

It was still raining. I looked in at the Iruña for the gang and they were not there, so I walked on around the square and back to the hotel.

They were eating dinner in the down-stairs dining-room.

They were well ahead of me and it was no use trying to catch them.

Bill was buying shoe-shines for Mike.

Bootblacks opened the street door and each one Bill called over and started to work on Mike.

"This is the eleventh time my boots have been polished," Mike said. "I say, Bill is an ass."

The bootblacks had evidently spread the report. Another came in.

"Limpia botas ([西]要擦靴子吗)?" he said to Bill.

"No," said Bill. "For this Señor ([西]先生)."

The bootblack knelt down beside the one at work and started on Mike's free shoe that shone already in the electric light.

"Bill's a yell of laughter," Mike said.

I was drinking red wine, and so far behind them that I felt a little uncomfortable about all this shoe-shining.

I looked around the room. At the next table was Pedro Romero.

He stood up when I nodded, and asked me to come over and meet a friend.

His table was beside ours, almost touching.

I met the friend, a Madrid bullfight critic, a little man with a drawn face.

I told Romero how much I liked his work, and he was very pleased.

We talked Spanish and the critic knew a little French.

I reached to our table for my winebottle, but the critic took my arm. Romero laughed.

"Drink here," he said in English.

He was very bashful about his English, but he was really very pleased with it, and as we went on talking he brought out words he was not sure of, and asked me about them.

> ==bashful==
>
> adj. 忸怩；羞怯的；局促不安的（shy and easily embarrassed）
>
> 原文：He was very bashful about his English, but he was really very pleased with it...
>
> 他说起英语来很腼腆，但是他打心眼儿里乐意说英语……
>
> 💧bashful 表示“（在社交场合）困窘的”，它的动词形式是abash “使困窘，羞愧”（to cause to feel ill at ease）. bashful也就是to be abashed. 比如：Don’t be bashful about telling people how you feel.
>
> 不要羞于说出自己的感受。

He was anxious to know the English for Corrida de toros, the exact translation.

Bull-fight he was suspicious of.

>
> corrida在西语里是running的意思（作名词），de相当于英语里的of，toros也就是bulls，连起来Corrida de toros就是the running of the bulls的意思，因此这个评论家觉得翻译成bull-fight是不够恰当的。

I explained that bull-fight in Spanish was the lidia of a toro.

The Spanish word corrida means in English the running of bulls — the French translation is Course de taureaux.

> 我解释说，bull-fight在西班牙语中意为对toro的lidia. Corrida这西班牙语词在英语中意为“牛群的奔驰”——法语是Course de taureaux.
>
> **💧知识拓展**
>
> Jake肯定了这位评论家的看法。英文里的bull-fight在西班牙语里其实是the lidia of a toro（和牛的搏击/搏斗），lidia也就是fight，这和原本的Corrida de toros表达的“牛群的奔驰”意思不一样。但这个词在法语里的翻译是准确的（Course de taureaux），所以他们得出来的结论就是英语里没有和Corrida de toros准确对应的词。

The critic put that in. There is no Spanish word for bull-fight.

Pedro Romero said he had learned a little English in Gibraltar.

He was born in Ronda.

That is not far above Gibraltar.

He started bull-fighting in Malaga in the bull-fighting school there.

He had only been at it three years.

The bull-fight critic joked him about the number of Malagueno expressions he used.

He was nineteen years old, he said.

His older brother was with him as a banderillero (短枪手，斗牛士助手), but he did not live in this hotel.

He lived in a smaller hotel with the other people who worked for Romero.

He asked me how many times I had seen him in the ring. I told him only three.

It was really only two, but I did not want to explain after I had made the mistake.

"Where did you see me the other time? In Madrid?"

"Yes," I lied. I had read the accounts of his two appearances in Madrid in the bull-fight papers, so I was all right.

"The first or the second time?" "The first."

"I was very bad," he said. "The second time I was better. You remember?" He turned to the critic.

He was not at all embarrassed.

He talked of his work as something altogether apart from himself.

There was nothing conceited or braggartly about him.

> ==conceited英 [kənˈsi:tɪd] 美 [kənˈsitɪd] adj. （人）自负的，自高自大的，骄傲自满的==
>
> ==braggartly英 [b'ræɡətlɪ] 美 [b'ræɡətlɪ] 　 adv. 自夸地==

"I like it very much that you like my work," he said. "But you haven't seen it yet.

To-morrow, if I get a good bull, I will try and show it to you."

When he said this he smiled, anxious that neither the bull-fight critic nor I would think he was boasting.

"I am anxious to see it," the critic said. "I would like to be convinced."

"He doesn't like my work much." Romero turned to me. He was serious.

The critic explained that he liked it very much, but that so far it had been incomplete.

"Wait till to-morrow, if a good one comes out."

"Have you seen the bulls for to-morrow?" the critic asked me.

"Yes. I saw them unloaded."

Pedro Romero leaned forward.

"What did you think of them?"

"Very nice," I said. "About twenty-sixarrobas. Very short horns. Haven't you seen them?"

"Oh, yes," said Romero.

"They won't weigh twenty-six arrobas," said the critic.

"Oh, yes," said Romero. "They won'tweigh twenty-six arrobas," said the critic.

"You call them bananas?" asked Romero. He turned to me and smiled.

"You wouldn't call them bananas?"

"No," I said. "They're horns all right."

"They're very short," said Pedro Romero. "Very, very short. Still, theyaren't bananas."

"I say, Jake," Brett called from the next table, "you have deserted us."

"Just temporarily," I said. "We're talking bulls."

"You are superior."

"Tell him that bulls have no balls," Mike shouted. He was drunk.

Romero looked at me inquiringly.

> ==inquiringly英 [ɪnk'waɪərɪŋlɪ] 美 [ɪnk'waɪərɪŋlɪ] 　adv. 诧异地==

"Drunk," I said. "Borracho! Muy borracho! ([西]醉了！完全是醉了！)"

"You might introduce your friends," Brett said.

She had not stopped looking at Pedro Romero.

I asked them if they would like to have coffee with us.

They both stood up. Romero's face was very brown.

He had very nice manners.

### 背景知识

**💧西班牙的传统服饰**

虽然阴雨连绵，但狂欢节依然在继续。这天大家都坐在斗牛场上看来自巴斯克和纳瓦拉的舞蹈家和歌唱家们表演节目（people sitting out of the rain watching the concourse of Basque and Navarrais dancers and singers）, 还有卡洛斯谷的艺术家们冒雨赶来，身上的服侍都被淋湿了（their costumes wet）.

他们的脚缠着白色的绑腿（tight-wound white legs），小帽上系着铃铛（belled caps），外衣也都是姹紫嫣红的（red and purple jackets）.

其实西班牙的传统服饰还不仅于此，由于不同文化、气候和地理条件的影响，各个民族和地区的服装都别具特色，而且还与宗教、舞蹈和斗牛有着密切的关系。但是随着时代的发展，只能在一些传统节日庆祝活动、舞蹈、戏剧，或一些旅游点的传统节目表演中看到这些服装了。从风格上讲，北方地区比较朴素，色调以灰黑白为主，而南方则艳丽夸张，热情奔放。

下面我们来具体了解一些地区的传统服饰：

\1. 塞维利亚传统服装

紧身的裙子，大波浪般的裙摆，头顶上的鲜花，这就是来自西班牙弗拉门戈舞的服装，起源可追溯至古代的罗姆人（也称为吉普赛人），大约定型于19世纪初。通常女性手中还会持一把精致的小扇子。



\2. 吉普斯夸传统服装

当地的传统服装灵感来自农村活动中的礼服，红色和黑色是基调，女士佩戴白色头巾；男士则戴红色贝雷帽。



\3. 坎塔布里亚传统服装

该地区的传统服装诞生于西班牙的18世纪，流行于北部的桑坦德地区，特点之一是女性的裙摆非常宽松，长至脚踝，群内有多层内衬用于支撑裙摆，肩部佩戴三角形披肩，头上戴各色头巾；而男性服装则简单的多，通常是衬衫、马甲、外套以及腰部的布面腰带，而三角锥形的帽子则是男装的一大特色。



\4. 加泰罗尼亚民族服装

据说加泰罗尼亚地区的传统服装代表了当地两个历史人物：Hereus和Pubillas，Hereus是当地农民家庭的女继承人，而Pubillas则是男继承人——这种说法起源于20世纪初期的加泰罗尼亚地区传统的农村家庭的联姻制度。女装一般是白色蕾丝披肩配黑色上衣及花裙；男士则更简单，穿着白衬衫、黑马甲和黑裤，男装还可以加上一件直到脚踝的长袍。

### 课文理解

今天我们进入到了全新的一个章节，在昨天的内容里本书的最后一位角色已经登场——Romero. 接着我们也会看到作者如何安排这些人的行动来制造冲突，从而达到小说的高潮。首先今天的情节里有一个铺垫，Montoya请Jake帮了一个忙，也就是不要让从美国来的大使们见到Romero，从中可以看出Montoya担任的是Romero的mentor的角色（mentor可以理解为“导师”或是“看护人”）——

💧**Clue 1**: Montoya serves as the mentor of Romero.



**Evidence 1**: "Look," said Montoya. "People take a boy like that. They don't know what he's worth. They don't know what he means..."

“你看。”蒙托亚说。“人们竟然这样糊弄孩子。他们不懂得他的价值。他们不懂得他对我们意味着什么。”



**Evidence 2**: "He's such a fine boy," said Montoya. "He ought to stay with his own people. He shouldn't mix in that stuff."

“他是个多好的小伙啊。”蒙托亚说。“他应该同自己的人民在一起。他不该参与这种事儿。”



Montoya首先是试探性地和Jake说了这件事，没想到Jake和他的想法一致，他们都认为应该保护Romero的纯真性。所以Montoya在这里有点把Romero托付给Jake的意味，他愿意把Jake介绍给Romero是出于他对Jake的信任和崇敬（我们在前面分析过Montoya对于真正热爱斗牛的人格外亲近），所以希望Jake可以尽量保护Montoya不要受到坏的影响（尤其是在和外国人接触的时候）。

Jake虽然在这里表示了同意（"Well," I said, "it's easy. All you have to do is not give him the message."）但他很快就会打破这个约定，而且他带到Romero身边的，是更危险的一样东西。

随后Jake在酒店的餐厅里遇上Romero，便和Romero以及他的一位评论家朋友一起同桌。Romero在这个过程中表现得非常彬彬有礼（He had very nice manners）——



💧**Clue 2**: Romero has good breeding.



**Evidence 1**: "They've got bananas for horns," the critic said.

"You call them bananas?" asked Romero. He turned to me and smiled. "You w ouldn't call them bananas?"

“它们头上长的是香蕉，不是牛角。”评论家说。

“你管那些叫香蕉？”罗梅罗问。他朝我笑笑。“你不会管牛角叫香蕉吧？”



**Evidence 2**: "No," I said. "They're horns all right."

"They're very short," said Pedro Romero. "Very, very short. Still, they aren't bananas."

“不。”我说。“牛角总归是牛角。”

“它们很短，”罗梅罗说。“非常非常短。不过，他们可不是香蕉。”



面对这位评论家非常无礼地把牛角说成是香蕉，Romero没有直接反驳，而是先征求Jake的意见，并且面带微笑地不露丝毫愠色，这都说明了他有非常良好的教养。

这时候，Brett主动要求Jake把Romero介绍给她（"You might introduce your friends," Brett said. She had not stopped looking at Pedro Romero）. Jake没有拒绝，是因为他忘记了Montoya的嘱托还是另有所想？和Brett的接触又会对Romero产生什么样的影响？在接下来的故事里我们会看到伴随着冲突升级的还有对各个人物隐藏面的揭露。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧English vocabulary derived from Spanish**

**来自西班牙语的英语词汇**



我们都知道英语受法语、拉丁语影响很大，其实西班牙语对英语的影响也不容忽视，特别是近现代。由于美国特殊的历史因素和地理位置，每年都会有大量的拉美人（Hispanic or Latin American or Latino） 移民、旅游、偷渡到美国，对美国的文化尤其是语言产生了很大影响，他们向美语引入了大量西班牙语词汇（比如我们之前介绍的fiesta表示“狂欢节”以及aficionado表示“狂热爱好者”也都是从西语进入英语的）。

以及昨天的内容里提到的picador（长矛手）和matador（主斗牛士）都来源于西班牙语词，其中matador来源于西班牙语动词matar，意为“杀”。还有一些非常简单的单词例如banana，potato，tomato，chocolate也都来源于西班牙语。

下面我们就来看一下英语中还有哪些来源于西班牙语的词汇~



\1. amigo 朋友（超级超级常用的词汇！）

Your time will be come, amigo.

你的时代会到来的，朋友。



\2. burrito 玉米煎饼

Mexican chicken burrito 也就是墨西哥鸡肉卷（去过肯德基的人应该都知道），它的外层就是用玉米煎饼做的，所以名字里有个burrito.

Upon my arrival at the hotel, I went straight to the bar and gorged on a chicken burrito with huge wedge potato fries. 

来到旅馆之后，我就直奔这家酒吧，品尝了一份墨西哥鸡肉卷和大号薯条。



\3. caballero 骑士

这个词来源于非常著名的西班牙作家塞万提斯)（Cervantes）写的小说《堂吉诃德》（*Don Quixote*）中骑士的形象。

Become the caballero or bow hand with illustrious reputation! 

成为声名赫赫的骑手或者弓箭手！



\4. cargo 货物，船货

来源于动词中cargar，意思是装载货物。

The crew lashed down the cargo on the fore deck. 

船员们把前甲板上的货物捆牢了。



\5. guerrilla 游击战，游击队员

来自西班牙语名词guerra，为“战争warfare”的意思。

 The guerrillas threatened to kill their hostages. 

 游击队员们威胁要杀死人质。



\6. crusade 改革运动, 十字军东征

来源于西班牙语cruzado，意味“交叉的”。

My crusade to inspire will continue whether people think it’s possible or not. 

无论人们认为可能与否，我的改革运动都不会停止。



\7. tornado 旋风

来源于西班牙语词汇tornar，意味“扭转”。

The tornado rubbished the whole village. 

龙卷风毁掉了整个村庄。

I introduced them all around and they started to sit down, but there was not enough room, so we all moved over to the big table by the wall to have coffee.

Mike ordered a bottle of Fundador and glasses for everybody.

There was a lot of drunken talking.

"Tell him I think writing is lousy," Bill said. "Go on, tell him. Tell him I'm ashamed of being a writer."

Pedro Romero was sitting beside Brett and listening to her.

"Go on. Tell him!" Bill said.

Romero looked up smiling.

"This gentleman," I said, "is a writer."

Romero was impressed.

"This other one, too," I said, pointing at Cohn.

"He looks like Villalta," Romero said,looking at Bill.

"Rafael, doesn't he look like Villalta?"

"I can't see it," the critic said.

"Really," Romero said in Spanish. "He looks a lot like Villalta. What does the drunken one do?"

"Nothing." "Is that why he drinks?"

"No. He's waiting to marry this lady."

"Tell him bulls have no balls!" Mike shouted, very drunk, from the other end of the table.

"What does he say?" "He's drunk."

"Jake," Mike called. "Tell him bulls have no balls!"

"You understand?" I said."Yes."

I was sure he didn't, so it was all right.

"Tell him Brett wants to see him puton those green pants."

"Pipe down, Mike." "Tell him Brett is dying to know how he can get into those pants." "Pipe down."

During this Romero was fingering his glass and talking with Brett.

Brett was talking French and he was talking Spanish and a little English, and laughing.

Bill was filling the glasses.

"Tell him Brett wants to come into — "

"Oh, pipe down, Mike, for Christ's sake!"

Romero looked up smiling.

"Pipe down! I know that," he said.

Just then Montoya came into the room.

He started to smile at me, then he saw Pedro Romero with a big glass of cognac in his hand, sitting laughing between me and a woman with bare shoulders, at a table full of drunks. He did not even nod.

Montoya went out of the room.

Mike was on his feet proposing a toast.

>
> ②propose a toast 指“祝酒”，如果表示“向某人”只需要加上to, 比如：I’d like to propose a toast to the bride and groom.（我提议为新郎新娘干杯。） 

"Let's all drink to — " he began.

"Pedro Romero," I said.

Everybody stood up.

Romero took it very seriously, and we touched glasses and drank it down, I rushing it a little because Mike was trying to make it clear that that was not at all what he was going to drink to.

But it went off all right, and Pedro Romero shook hands with every one and he and the critic went out together.

"My God! he's a lovely boy," Brett said. "And how I would love to see him get into those clothes. He must use a shoe-horn."

"I started to tell him," Mike began. "And Jake kept interrupting me. Why do you interrupt me? Do you think you talk Spanish better than I do?"

"Oh, shut up, Mike! Nobody interrupted you."

"No, I'd like to get this settled." He turned away from me. "Do you think you amount to something, Cohn? Do you think you belong here among us?

> <font color=red>"Do you think you amount to something, Cohn?"</font>
>
> “你以为你有什么了不起吗，科恩？”
>

>
> amount to something 也就是“算个人物，有点了不起”（形容某人是something其实就是说这个人有点来头的意思）。另外not amount to much/anything这个表达也就可以用来形容一个人没出息，比如：Jim’s never going to amount to much.（吉姆永远不会有多大出息。） 

People who are out to have a good time? For God's sake don't be so noisy, Cohn!"

"Oh, cut it out, Mike," Cohn said.

"Do you think Brett wants you here?Do you think you add to the party? Why don't you say something?"

>
> 这里的add to the party可以理解为“给聚会带来乐子、助兴”或者是“给聚会增色”。

"I said all I had to say the other night, Mike."

"I'm not one of you literary chaps." Mike stood shakily and leaned against the table.

> ==shakily英 ['ʃeɪkɪlɪ] 美 ['ʃeɪkɪlɪ] adv. 颤抖着；摇晃地；发抖地；不坚定地==

"I'm not clever. But I do know when I'm not wanted.

Why don't you see when you're not wanted, Cohn?

Go away. Go away, for God's sake. Take that sad Jewish face away.

Don't you think I'm right?" He looked at us.

"Sure," I said. "Let's all go over to the Irufla."

"No. Don't you think I'm right? I love that woman."

"Oh, don't start that again. Do shove it along, Michael," Brett said.

"Don't you think I'm right, Jake?"

Cohn still sat at the table.

His face had the sallow, yellow look it got when he was insulted, but somehow he seemed to be enjoying it.

The childish, drunken heroics of it.

> ==heroic英 [həˈrəʊɪk] 美 [həˈroʊɪk] adj. 有英雄气概的，英雄的，英勇的；记叙英雄及其事迹的；夸张的 n. 英雄诗，史诗；英勇行为；夸张的言行；咬文嚼字，文诌诌==

It was his affair with a lady of title.

"Jake," Mike said. He was almost crying. "You know I'm right. Listen, you!"

He turned to Cohn: "Go away! Go away now!"

"But I won't go, Mike," said Cohn.

"Then I'll make you!" Mike started toward him around the table.

Cohn stood up and took off his glasses.

He stood waiting, his face sallow, his hands fairly low, proudly and firmly waiting for the assault, ready to do battle for his lady love.

> ==assault英 [əˈsɔ:lt] 美 [əˈsɔlt] n. 攻击；袭击，进攻；威胁，殴打；侵犯人身 vt. 袭击；强暴；使（感官）难受==

>
> 💧assault 还可以引申为“抨击”：under assault表示“受到抨击”，比如：Traditional family values are increasingly under assault. 
>
> 传统的家庭价值观日益受到抨击。

I grabbed Mike. "Come on to the café," I said. "You can't hit him herein the hotel."

"Good!" said Mike. "Good idea!"

We started off.

I looked back as Mike stumbled up the stairs and saw Cohn putting his glasses on again.

Bill was sitting at the table pouring another glass of Fundador.

Brett was sitting looking straight ahead at nothing.

Outside on the square it had stopped raining and the moon was trying to get through the clouds.

There was a wind blowing.

The military band was playing and the crowd was massed on the far side of the square where the fireworks specialist and his son were trying to send up fire balloons.

A balloon would start up jerkily, on a great bias, and be torn by the wind or blown against the houses of the square.

There was no one dancing in the square. The gravel was too wet.

Brett came out with Bill and joined us.

We stood in the crowd and watched Don Manuel Orquito, the fireworks king, standing on a little platform, carefully starting the balloons with sticks, standing above the heads of the crowd to launch the balloons off into the wind.

The wind brought them all down, and Don Manuel Orquito's face was sweaty in the light of his complicated fireworks that fell into the crowd and charged and chased,sputtering and cracking, between the legs of the people.

"They're razzing Don Manuel," Bill said.

"How do you know he's Don Manuel?" Brett said.

"His name's on the programme. DonManuel Orquito, the pirotecnico of esta ciudad ([西]本城的焰火师)."

"Globos illuminados ([西]照明气球，焰火气球)," Mike said. "A collection of globos illuminados. That's what the paper said."

The wind blew the band music away.

"I say, I wish one would go up," Brett said. "That Don Manuel chap is furious."

"He's probably worked for weeks fixing them to go off, spelling out 'Hail to San Fermin,' " Bill said.

"Globos illuminados," Mike said. "A bunch of bloody globos illuminados."

"Come on," said Brett. "We can't stand here."

"Her ladyship wants a drink," Mike said.

"How you know things," Brett said.

Inside, the café was crowded and very noisy.

No one noticed us come in.

We could not find a table.

There was a great noise going on.

"Come on, let's get out of here," Billsaid.

Outside the paseo was going in under the arcade.

There were some English and Americans from Biarritz in sport clothes scattered at the tables.

Some of the women stared at the people going by with lorgnons.

We had acquired, at some time, a friend of Bill's from Biarritz.

She was staying with another girl at the Grand Hotel.

The other girl had a headache and had gone to bed.

"Here's the pub," Mike said.

It was the Bar Milano, a small, tough bar where you could get food and where they danced in the back room.

We all sat down at a table and ordered a bottle of Fundador.

The bar was not full.

There was nothing going on.

"This is a hell of a place," Bill said.

"It's too early."

"Let's take the bottle and come back later," Bill said. "I don't want tosit here on a night like this."

"Let's go and look at the English," Mike said. "I love to look at the English."

"They're awful," Bill said. "Where did they all come from?"

"They come from Biarritz," Mike said. "They come to see the last day of the quaint little Spanish fiesta."

"I'll festa them," Bill said.

"You're an extraordinarily beautiful girl." Mike turned to Bill's friend. "When did you come here?"

"Come off it, Michael."

"I say, she is a lovely girl. Where have I been?

"Where have I been looking all this while?

"You're a lovely thing. Have we met?

"Come along with me and Bill. We're going to festa the English."

"I'll festa them," Bill said. "What the hell are they doing at this fiesta?"

"Come on," Mike said. "Just us three. We're going to festa the bloody English.

"I hope you're not English?

"I'm Scotch. I hate the English.

"I'm going to festa them. Come on, Bill."

### 背景知识

**💧Why does Scottish do not like to be called the English？**

**苏格兰人为什么不喜欢被称为英国人**

Mike said. "Just us three. We're going to festa the bloody English. I hope you're not English? I'm Scotch. I hate the English..."

在今天的最后一段话中Mike说道：“就我们三个人。我们领这帮该死的英国佬看热闹去。希望你不是英国人。我是苏格兰人。我讨厌英国人。” 

从Mike的言语和语气中我们可以看出身为苏格兰人的Mike对于English称呼的鄙视。English一般指英格兰人，下面我们一起了解一下苏格兰和英格兰有什么恩恩怨怨。

英国全称为大不列颠及北爱尔兰联合王国（The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland），由英格兰（England）、威尔士（Wales）、苏格兰（Scotland） 和北爱尔兰（Northern Ireland）组成，而整个英国的历史也就是由这四个区域的历史交织组成。这个联邦制国家除了都支持君主立宪制，他们在语言、文化、传统甚至法律上都存在一定差别，苏格兰与英格兰的恩怨纠葛由来已久，他们谁都不服谁。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/8c8f404976d0c72f221615ba98df9491-sz_95448.png)



公元前54年，罗马帝国( Roman Empire ) 军队渡过英吉利海峡（the English Channel ），入侵不列颠岛，那时候的不列颠岛上居住的是凯尔特人(Celtic)，跟精锐的罗马军队相比，基本就是原始人( primitive people). 罗马人打败了凯尔特人，但是由于苏格兰地形复杂，民风彪悍，不好管理，于是罗马放弃了苏格兰，而是改为在英格兰、苏格兰交界的地方修长城。

公元11世纪，邓肯一世继承了苏格兰地区的王国的王位，没多久又被麦克白推翻，过了十几年，邓肯一世的儿子马尔康姆三世复仇，重登大宝。（这就是莎士比亚悲剧《麦克白》(*Macbeth*) 的故事原型）。

反应苏格兰反英战争最有影响力的电影：《勇敢的心》

在苏格兰与英格兰的历史恩怨中，最广为人知的就是13-14世纪的苏格兰抗英战争了，这极大程度上要归功于美国电影《勇敢的心》，以苏格兰历史上的传奇英雄威廉·华莱士为原型，他这场战争中率领起义军奋起反抗英军，并在1305年被杀害。在1314年大胜英格兰国王爱德华二世以后，苏格兰恢复了事实上的独立。

不过16到17世纪间，苏格兰与英格兰之间的关系也谈不上多好，比如克伦威尔在1650年又率领英格兰军队再次攻占苏格兰。只是在1660年查理二世复辟以后，苏格兰才自动恢复了独立地位，直到1707年与英格兰在保持王位联合基础的情况下，和平完成合并。

图：克伦威尔完成了英格兰历史上最后一次对苏格兰的武力征服

从1688年起，苏格兰又被英格兰拖入多场战争，更是彻底失去了法国、荷兰等市场。

1707年的合并，实际上是苏格兰王国在万般无奈的情况下以出卖自身独立性——不再保留独立国家。事实上在1703-1704年，苏格兰和英格兰之间的关系还一度极为紧张，几乎再次处于战争边缘。

苏格兰和英格兰的恩怨由来已久，当我们询问一个人是不是英国人的时候，我们可以问Are you British? 来避免尴尬。

### 课文理解

Jake把Romero介绍给了Mike和Brett, 但Mike开始醉态百出胡言乱语，Romero则和Brett相谈甚欢。结果这一幕被正好走进来的Montoya看见了。我们昨天提到过，Montoya出于信任把Romero托付给Jake, 不希望他和外国人搅和在一块，但今天他明显对于Jake破坏约定十分不悦——

💧**Clue 1**: Montoya is angry with Jake's betrayal.



**Evidence 1**: He started to smile at me, then he saw Pedro Romero with a big glass of cognac in his hand, sitting laughing between me and a woman with bare shoulders, at a table full of drunks. He did not even nod.

他正要朝我微笑，但是看见了佩德罗·罗梅罗手里拿着一大杯白兰地，坐在我和一个肩膀袒露的女人之间哈哈大笑，同桌的都是醉汉。他甚至连头也没点一下。



当然这一个场景惹怒的不只是Montoya, Mike虽然心里醋意横生，但他除了嘲讽Romero几句（"Tell him Brett wants to see him put on those green pants."）并没有胆量直接和他挑明（可能是出于自卑的心理），转而把怒火发泄在了Cohn身上（"No, I'd like to get this settled." He turned away from me. "Do you think you amount to something, Cohn? Do you think you belong here among us? People who are out to have a good time? For God's sake don't be so noisy, Cohn!"）



这一次Cohn没有闷声不吭，相反地，他甚至为此感到得意并且随时准备好要跟Mike干一架——



💧**Clue 2**: Cohn takes pleasure in his affair with Brett and ready to fight with Mike.



**Evidence 1**: Cohn still sat at the table. His face had the sallow, yellow look it got when he was insulted, but somehow he seemed to be enjoying it. The childish, drunken heroics of it. It was his affair with a lady of title.

科恩仍在桌边坐着。他每逢受到侮辱，脸色就变得蜡黄，但是他似乎也有点自得其乐。酒后夸夸其谈的蠢话。和他发生关系的可是一位有头衔的夫人。



**Evidence 2**: Cohn stood up and took off his glasses. He stood waiting, his face sallow, his hands fairly low, proudly and firmly waiting for the assault, ready to do battle for his lady love.

科恩站起来，摘下眼镜。他站着等待，脸色蜡黄，放低双手，骄傲而毅然地迎候攻击，准备为心上人作一番奋战。



作者在这里调侃了Cohn身上那种过时的骑士精神——“chivalry”（the medieval system, principles, and customs of knighthood）. 这种精神在中世纪被认为是贵族的一种高尚品格，它的核心就是：遵循社会规则，关爱自己和他人，尤其是敢于为自己心爱的女人奉献。



在本书开头的时候作者就给我们埋下了这个伏笔：当时Cohn在看一本叫作《紫色大地》（The Purple Land）的书，这本书里的主角就是一个四处和貌美的女郎们浪漫冒险的英国绅士（Cohn深受影响，因此还想要到南美去一趟）。



所以面对Mike的斥责，Cohn反而觉得自己是在光荣地为了Brett忍辱负重，甚至愿意和Mike公开对战（ready to do battle for his lady love）. 这种逞装英雄的自我陶醉在旁人看来其实可笑无比，虽然Mike醉得糊涂，但他有一句话却道出了事实，也就是Cohn很多时候都没有自知之明（"I'm not clever. But I do know when I'm not wanted. Why don't you see when you're not wanted, Cohn?"）接下来的情节马上就会证明他对Brett其实只是一厢情愿。

Through the window we saw them, all three arm in arm, going toward the café.

Rockets were going up in the square.

"I'm going to sit here," Brett said.

"I'll stay with you," Cohn said.

"Oh, don't!" Brett said. "For God's sake, go off somewhere.

Can't you see Jake and I want to talk?"

"I didn't," Cohn said. "I thought I'd sit here because I felt a little tight."

"What a hell of a reason for sitting with any one.

If you're tight, go to bed. Go on to bed."

"Was I rude enough to him?" Brett asked.

Cohn was gone. "My God! I'm so sick of him!"

"He doesn't add much to the gayety."

"He depresses me so."

"He's behaved very badly."

"Damned badly. He had a chance to behave so well."

> <font color=red>"Damned badly. He had a chance to behave so well."</font>

> “太不像话了。他原有机会不必这样的。

> had a chance to do “原有机会如何做”，在这里的语气其实就相当于could have done: He could have behaved so well.

"He's probably waiting just outside the door now."

"Yes. He would. You know I do know how he feels.

He can't believe it didn't mean anything."

"I know." "Nobody else would behave as badly.

Oh, I'm so sick of the whole thing.

And Michael. Michael's been lovely, too."

"It's been damned hard on Mike."

"Yes. But he didn't need to be a swine."

"Everybody behaves badly," I said. "Give them the proper chance."

"You wouldn't behave badly." Brett looked at me.

"I'd be as big an ass as Cohn," I said.

"Darling, don't let's talk a lot of rot."

"All right. Talk about anything you like."

"Don't be difficult. You're the only person I've got, and I feel rather awful to-night."

"You've got Mike."

"Yes, Mike. Hasn't he been pretty?"

"Well," I said, "it's been damned hard on Mike, having Cohn around and seeing him with you."

"Don't I know it, darling?

Please don't make me feel any worse than I do."

Brett was nervous as I had never seen her before.

She kept looking away from me and looking ahead at the wall.

"Want to go for a walk?" "Yes. Come on."

I corked up the Fundador bottle and gave it to the bartender.

> ==bartender英 [ˈbɑ:tendə(r)] 美 [ˈbɑ:rtendə(r)] n. 酒吧间销售酒精饮料的人，酒吧间男招待==

"Let's have one more drink of that," Brett said. "My nerves are rotten."

We each drank a glass of the smooth amontillado brandy.

"Come on," said Brett.

As we came out the door I saw Cohn walk out from under the arcade.

"He was there," Brett said.

"He can't be away from you."

"Poor devil!" "I'm not sorry for him. I hate him, myself."

"I hate him, too," she shivered. "I hate his damned suffering."

We walked arm in arm down the side Street away from the crowd and the lights of the square.

The street was dark and wet, and we walked along it to the fortifications at the edge of town.

> ==fortification==
>
> n. 防御工事；筑垒，设防（towers, walls etc built around a place in order to protect it or defend it）

We passed wine-shops with light coming out from their doors onto the black, wet street, and sudden bursts of music.

"Want to go in?" "No."

We walked out across the wet grass and onto the stone wall of the fortifications.

I spread a newspaper on the stone and Brett sat down.

Across the plain it was dark, and we could see the mountains.

The wind was high up and took the clouds across the moon.

Below us were the dark pits of the fortifications.

Behind were the trees and the shadow of the cathedral, and the town silhouetted against the moon.

> ==silhouette==

> silhouette pictures of snowmen and reindeer 雪人和驯鹿的剪影画

"Don't feel bad," I said.

"I feel like hell," Brett said. "Don't let's talk."

We looked out at the plain.

The long lines of trees were dark in the moonlight.

There were the lights of a car on the road climbing the mountain.

Up on the top of the mountain we saw the lights of the fort.

Below to the left was the river.

It was high from the rain, and black and smooth.

Trees were dark along the banks.

We sat and looked out.

Brett stared straight ahead. Suddenly she shivered.

"It's cold."

"Want to walk back?" "Through the park."

We climbed down. It was clouding over again.

In the park it was dark under the trees.

"Do you still love me, Jake?"

"Yes," I said.

"Because I'm a goner," Brett said.

"How?" "I'm a goner.

I'm mad about the Romero boy. I'm in love with him, I think."

"I wouldn't be if I were you."

"I can't help it. I'm a goner. It's tearing me all up inside."

>
> ②tear up 可以表示“撕碎”（to tear something into pieces）或者是“（猛地）拔起，推倒”（to remove sth from the ground）, 这里的tear up可以理解为这件事把Brett的内心搅腾地翻天覆地。

"Don't do it."

"I can't help it. I've never been able to help anything."

"You ought to stop it."

"How can I stop it? I can't stop things. Feel that?"

Her hand was trembling. "I'm like that all through."

"You oughtn't to do it." "I can't help it. I'm a goner now, anyway.

Don't you see the difference?" "No."

"I've got to do something. I've got to do something I really want to do.

I've lost my self-respect."

"You don't have to do that."

"Oh, darling, don't be difficult.

What do you think it's meant to have that damned Jew about, and Mike the way he's acted?"

> <font color=red>"Oh, darling, don't be difficult. What do you think it's meant to have that damned Jew about, and Mike the way he's acted?"</font>

"Sure." "I can't just stay tight all the time."

"No." "Oh, darling, please stay by me.

Please stay by me and see me through this."

"Sure." "I don't say it's right.

It is right though for me.

God knows, I've never felt such a bitch."

"What do you want me to do?"

"Come on," Brett said. "Let's go and find him."

Together we walked down the gravel path in the park in the dark, under the trees and then out from under the trees and past the gate into the Street that led into town.

Pedro Romero was in the café.

He was at a table with other bullfighters and bull-fight critics.

They were smoking cigars.

When we came in they looked up.

Romero smiled and bowed.

We sat down at a table half-way down the room.

"Ask him to come over and have a drink."

"Not yet. He'll come over."

"I can't look at him."

"He's nice to look at," I said.

"I've always done just what I wanted."

"I know." "I do feel such a bitch."

"Well," I said.

"My God!" said Brett, "the things a woman goes through."

"Yes?" "Oh, I do feel such a bitch."

I looked across at the table. Pedro Romero smiled.

He said something to the other people at his table, and stood up.

He came over to our table.

I stood up and we shook hands.

"Won't you have a drink?"

"You must have a drink with me," he said.

He seated himself, asking Brett's permission without saying anything.

He had very nice manners.

But he kept on smoking his cigar.

It went well with his face.

"You like cigars?" I asked.

"Oh, yes. I always smoke cigars."

It was part of his system of authority.

It made him seem older.

I noticed his skin. It was clear and smooth and very brown.

There was a triangular scar on his cheek-bone.

I saw he was watching Brett.

He felt there was something between them.

He must have felt it when Brett gave him her hand.

He was being very careful.

I think he was sure, but he did not want to make any mistake.

"You fight to-morrow?" I said.

"Yes," he said. "Algabeno was hurt to-day in Madrid. Did you hear?"

"No," I said. "Badly?"

He shook his head. "Nothing. Here,"he showed his hand

Brett reached out and spread the fingers apart.

"Oh!" he said in English, "you tell fortunes?"

"Sometimes. Do you mind?"

"No. I like it." He spread his hand flat on the table.

"Tell me I live for always, and be a millionaire."

He was still very polite, but he was surer of himself.

"Look," he said, "do you see any bulls in my hand?"

He laughed. His hand was very fine and the wrist was small.

"There are thousands of bulls," Brett said.

She was not at all nervous now.

She looked lovely.

"Good," Romero laughed.

"At a thousand duros apiece," he said to me in Spanish. "Tell me some more."

"It's a good hand," Brett said. "I think he'll live a long time."

"Say it to me. Not to your friend."

"I said you'd live a long time."

"I know it," Romero said. "I'm never going to die."

I tapped with my finger-tips on the table.

Romero saw it. He shook his head.

"No. Don't do that. The bulls are my best friends."

I translated to Brett.

"You kill your friends?" she asked.

"Always," he said in English, and laughed. "So they don't kill me."

He looked at her across the table.

"You know English well."

"Yes," he said. "Pretty well, sometimes.

But I must not let anybody know.

It would be very bad, a torero who speaks English."

"Why?" asked Brett.

"It would be bad. The people would not like it. Not yet."

"Why not?"

"They would not like it. Bull-fighters are not like that."

"What are bull-fighters like?"

He laughed and tipped his hat down over his eyes and changed the angle of his cigar and the expression of his face.

"Like at the table," he said.

I glanced over. He had mimicked exactly the expression of Nacional.

He smiled, his face natural again.

"No. I must forget English."

"Don't forget it, yet," Brett said.

"No?" "No."

"All right." He laughed again.

"I would like a hat like that," Brett said.

"Good. I'll get you one."

"Right. See that you do."

"I will. I'll get you one to-night."

I stood up. Romero rose, too.

"Sit down," I said. "I must go and find our friends and bring them here."

He looked at me.

It was a final look to ask if it were understood.

It was understood all right.

"Sit down," Brett said to him. "You must teach me Spanish."

He sat down and looked at her across the table.

I went out. The hard-eyed people atthe bull-fighter table watched me go.

> ==hard-eyed英 [ˈhɑ:d aɪd] 美 [ˈhɑ:rd aɪd] adj. 冷眼旁观的，挑剔的，怀疑的==

It was not pleasant.

When I came back and looked in the café, twenty minutes later, Brett and Pedro Romero were gone.

The coffee-glasses and our three empty cognac-glasses were on the table.

A waiter came with a cloth and picked up the glasses and mopped off the table.

### 背景知识

**💧****骑士和骑士精神**

我们昨天的内容里提到了科恩愿意为了自己心爱的女人而战，我们可以看出科恩的想法是有一些天真和幼稚的，他追求浪漫，愿意为了女人奉献自己，其中体现了他对于骑士精神的追求。下面我们就来一起了解一下骑士的相关知识。

**1. 骑士（Knight/ Cavalier）** 

是欧洲中世纪（Middle Ages）时期受过正式的军事训练的骑兵，后来演变为一种荣誉称号用于表示一个社会阶层，他们为了自己的国家和宗教浴血奋战，备受大家的尊敬和向往。

**2. 骑士精神（chivalry ）**

 谦卑（humility）、荣誉（honor）、牺牲（sacrifice）、英勇（valor）、怜悯（compassion）、精神（spirituality）、诚实（honesty）、公正（justice）。        

**3. 与骑士相关的文学作品**

高文爵士与绿衣骑士（*Sir Gawain and the Green Knight*）

一个圣诞节， 亚瑟王（King Arthur）在自己的宫廷里举行宴会。一位绿衣骑士前来向圆桌骑士（Knights of the Round Table）挑战：有谁敢当场砍下他的头，并让他一年后回敬一斧。 高文接受挑战，砍下了绿衣骑士的头。

一年以后，高文去城堡寻找绿衣骑士，城堡女主人趁丈夫外出狩猎耍尽花招引诱高文，高文不为所动。绿衣骑士原来就是城堡的男主人，他举斧向高文进攻三次，前两次落空，第三次在他的脖子上划出轻伤。

绿衣骑士向他解释：落空的两斧是对他两次不受女主人诱惑并如实交换所得之物的回报，第三斧则是对高文隐瞒女主人送他腰带的惩罚。那根女主人送他的腰带（girdle）也是纯洁道德的象征。



堂吉诃德（*Don Quixote*）

故事发生时，骑士早已绝迹一个多世纪，主人公因为沉迷于骑士小说，时常幻想自己是个中世纪骑士， 穿上破旧的盔甲（armour），并且自己取名为唐·吉诃德，又把乡下少女想象是自己仰慕的公主，并以居住在附近的农民萨丘巴恩为其随从，然后骑着一匹瘦马开始“行侠仗义”、游走天下。

这位半正常半疯狂的这位骑士，把投宿的旅馆想象成城堡，将风车想象成巨人，而将犯罪被囚禁的犯人（prisoner）想成是牺牲者（victim）。最终他在遭受挫折后，被同村之神父及修理匠所囚禁并被带回村子，最终他从梦幻中苏醒过来，回到家乡后死去。



骑士派诗歌 （Cavalier Poets）

17世纪上半叶的英国诗歌的一派，骑士派诗人大多为朝臣、骑士和贵族青年，他们在内战中积极为国王效力，他们的诗歌受到本·琼生古典诗风影响，多以爱情为题材，反映贵族阶级生活与情调，描写了宫廷中的调情作乐与好战骑士为君杀敌的荣誉感，他们宣扬及时行乐。

此派以罗伯特•赫里克（Robert Herrick）为代表，他的诗歌《致少女》（To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time）中有一个非常有名的句子Gather ye rosebuds while ye may. 译为“有花堪折直须折”。

### 课文理解

我们在昨天的分析中提到，Cohn在很大程度上只是一厢情愿地追求Brett，比如当Brett想要和Jake单独谈话而Cohn执意要坐在他们中间时，Brett并没给他好脸色。在Cohn离开后，Brett更是直接和Jake说自己有多讨厌Cohn——

💧**Clue 1**: Brett acually can't stand Cohn.

**Evidence 1**: "Was I rude enough to him?" Brett asked. Cohn was gone. "My God! I'm so sick of him!"

“我对他够不客气了吧？”勃莱特问。科恩已经走了。“我的上帝！我真讨厌他！”

**Evidence 2**: "Yes. He would. You know I do know how he feels. He can't believe it didn't mean anything."

“是的，他会这样做的。你知道，我了解他是怎么想的。他不相信那桩事完全是逢场作戏。”

这里还隐藏了一个细节，Brett提到“He can't believe it didn't mean anything.” 这里it指的可能是Brett和Cohn一起去圣塞瓦斯蒂安玩的事情，也可以理解为暗指他们之间发生过关系。之后Brett继续向Jake坦诚自己爱上了Romero，但另一方面她也觉得自己不应该如此（"I do feel such a bitch."）于是她要求Jake陪着自己一起去找Romero. 我们来看看Romero这时候的表现——





💧**Clue 2**:  Romero also falls in love with Brett.

**Evidence 1**: I saw he was watching Brett. He felt there was something between them. He must have felt it when Brett gave him her hand. He was being very careful. I think he was sure, but he did not want to make any mistake.

我发现他在注视勃莱特。他感觉到他们之间有点什么。勃莱特同他握手的时候，他一定感觉到了什么。他非常谨慎。我想他已经很有把握，但是他要做到毫无差错。

**Evidence 2**: He looked at me. It was a final look to ask if it were understood. It was understood all right.

他看了我一眼。这最后的一眼是在探问我是否明白。我的确明白了。

最后的这个场景也非常有意思，当Jake起身说要把其他人一起叫来的时候，Romero也一同起身了，但Jake示意他坐下（"Sit down," I said. "I must go and find our friends and bring them here."）接着Romero给了Jake一个意味深长的眼神，Jake不用多问就知道Romero的意思了（Romero要和Brett独处）。

因此最后Jake只是在外面溜达了一会，二十分钟后他回来再看的时候，Romero和Brett已经离开了（When I came back and looked in the café, twenty minutes later, Brett and Pedro Romero were gone）. Jake在这里自愿地给Romero和Brett制造了机会，他的目的是否只是单纯地为了Brett，以及之后事态会如何发展，在接下来第17章的内容里我们将会看到一场激烈的冲突上演。

**💧****“敲木头”在西方习俗里的含义**

**"Knock on wood" in the western custom**

我们在前面提到了西方有一个习俗，就是如果说了不太吉利或是失言的话，会敲一下木头来去霉运或者抵消刚才说的话。那么如果身边没有木头做的东西怎么办呢？这时候直接说Knock on wood也是可以的（这是美国人常说的，在英国一般会说Touch wood并且象征性地敲一下自己的头）. 

这个习语的来源有两种说法，都很有趣：一种说它产生于中世纪， 当时人们认为只要触摸到耶稣受难的十字架就会给自己带来好运， 所以他们说knock on wood. 另一种说法是，古代有人迷信地认为木头里有专门破坏别人好事的神灵。 可是如果你说了knock on wood, 神灵就听不见你说的话，也就无法破坏你的好事了。



我们来看看这个表达会在哪些场景中使用：



Neglecting to knock on wood may have been responsible for the weather's unseemly behaviour today.

今天的天气这么差，一定是因为大家忘记“敲木头”了。

这里的knock on wood可以理解为“向上天祈祷”。

I’m hoping to get a promotion this month.Knock on wood!

希望我这个月可以升职，上帝保佑我！

I'm devastated. One of my old friends was just diagnosed with cancer. It was so unexpected. He seemed so healthy. I just pray nothing like that ever happens to my family, knock on wood.

太难过了。我的一个老朋友刚被诊断患了癌症，真是没想到。他平时看起来挺健康的。但愿这种事情不会发生在我家人身上，上帝保佑。

希望期待的事情发生或者不想要厄运降临，都可以说Knock on wood, 这个意思其实就跟我们中国人平时说的“老天爷保佑”差不多。



关于wood还有不少俚语表达，比如babe in the woods可以形容“某个人在某行中没有经验，一窍不通”，也就是菜鸟的意思。这个习语来自1595年一首很流行的诗歌“树林的孩子们”（“The Children of the Wood”）. 诗里写的是两个孤儿被遗弃在森林里的故事，所以babe in the woods后来一般是指孤立无助或是没有经验的人。我们来看一个情景：



When I first came to Hollywood, I didn't know anything. I can't tell you how many times I worked for almost no money. I didn't even know there was a minimum salary for actors. I was just a babe in the woods.

我刚到好莱坞的时候什么都不知道。 我都数不清有多少次我的工作几乎都是没有报酬的。我甚至不知道演员还有最低工资的规定。 那个时候我真是什么都不懂。



另外还有peckerwood (=peckawood，woodpecker) ，这个词原义是“啄木鸟”，后来被美国黑人用来形容“南方的穷苦白人”（a white person, especially a poor one）, 一个贬义词，比如：

Any white man from the South is a "peckerwood".

南方来的白人都被称为”啄木鸟”。



最后给大家介绍的是hard-wood, 它原本的意思是“硬木”（比如橡木、柚木这类都是硬木），但在俚语里可以指剧院里看戏的站票，或者是上座率不佳时出售的廉价票。比如：

I lost my hard-wood. Can I still see the show?

我把我的站票给丢了。我还能看这场戏吗？

## Chapter 17.1

Outside the Bar Milano I found Bill and Mike and Edna.

Edna was the girl's name.

"We've been thrown out," Edna said.

"By the police," said Mike. "There's some people in there that don't like me."

"I've kept them out of four fights," Edna said. "You've got to help me."

Bill's face was red.

"Come back in, Edna," he said. "Go on in there and dance with Mike."

"It's silly," Edna said. "There'll just be another row."

"Damned Biarritz swine," Bill said.

"Come on," Mike said. "After all, it's a pub.

They can't occupy a whole pub."

"Good old Mike," Bill said. "Damned English swine come here and insult Mike and try and spoil the fiesta."

"They're so bloody," Mike said. "I hate the English."

"They can't insult Mike," Bill said. "Mike is a swell fellow.

They can't insult Mike. I won't stand it.

Who cares if he is a damn bankrupt?" His voice broke.

> ==bankrupt英 [ˈbæŋkrʌpt] 美 [ˈbæŋkˌrʌpt, -rəpt] adj. 破产的，倒闭的；完全缺乏的；（名誉）扫地的，（智力等）完全丧失的；垮了的，枯竭的 n. 破产者；无力偿还债务者；丧失（名誉，智力等）的人 vt. 使破产，使枯竭，使极端贫困==

"Who cares?" Mike said. "I don't care.

Jake doesn't care. Do you care?"

"No," Edna said. "Are you a bankrupt?"

"Of course I am. You don't care, do you, Bill?"

Bill put his arm around Mike's shoulder.

"I wish to hell I was a bankrupt.

I'd show those bastards."

"They're just English," Mike said. "It never makes any difference what the English say."

"The dirty swine," Bill said. "I'm going to clean them out."

"Bill," Edna looked at me. "Please don't go in again, Bill.

They're so stupid."

"That's it," said Mike. "They're stupid.

I knew that was what it was."

"They can't say things like that about Mike," Bill said.

"Do you know them?" I asked Mike.

"No. I never saw them. They say they know me."

"I won't stand it," Bill said.

"Come on. Let's go over to the Suizo," I said.

"They're a bunch of Edna's friends from Biarritz," Bill said.

"They're simply stupid," Edna said.

"One of them's Charley Blackman, from Chicago," Bill said.

"I was never in Chicago," Mike said.

Edna started to laugh and could not stop.

"Take me away from here," she said, "you bankrupts."

"What kind of a row was it?" I asked Edna.

We were walking across the square to the Suizo. Bill was gone.

"I don't know what happened, but some one had the police called to keep Mike out of the back room.

There were some people that had known Mike at Cannes.

What's the matter with Mike?"

"Probably he owes them money," I said. "That's what people usually get bitter about."

> <font color=red>"Probably he owes them money," I said. "That's what people usually get bitter about."</font>
>
> “大概他欠他们钱了，”我说。“这种事容易结仇。”

> ①owe sb sth或者owe sth to sb都是指“欠某人（钱），对某人负有……义务”，比如：Thanks a lot for being so understanding about all this – I owe you one (=a favor) !（非常感谢你对这一切这么理解——我欠你一个人情！）
>
> ②bitter 在这里表示“充满敌意的，怨愤的”，bitter enemy可以指“死敌，宿敌”，be in a bitter dispute/battle/struggle就是指双方闹得不可开交，比如：The couple are locked in a bitter battle for custody of the children.（夫妻俩为争夺孩子的监护权闹得不可开交。） 

In front of the ticket-booths out in the square there were two lines of people waiting.

They were sitting on chairs or crouched on the ground with blankets and newspapers around them.

They were waiting for the wickets toopen in the morning to buy tickets for the bull-fight.

The night was clearing and the moon was out.

Some of the people in the line were sleeping.

At the Café Suizo we had just sat down and ordered Fundador when Robert Cohn came up.

"Where's Brett?" he asked.

"I don't know." "She was with you."

"She must have gone to bed."

"She's not." "I don't know where she is."

His face was sallow under the light. He was standing up.

"Tell me where she is."

"Sit down," I said. "I don't know where she is."

"The hell you don't!"

"You can shut your face."

"Tell me where Brett is."

"I'll not tell you a damn thing."

"You know where she is."

"If I did I wouldn't tell you."

"Oh, go to hell, Cohn," Mike called from the table.

"Brett's gone off with the bull-fighter chap.

They're on their honeymoon."

"You shut up." "Oh, go to hell!" Mike said languidly.

> ==languidly英 ['læŋɡwɪdlɪ] 美 [ˈlæŋɡwɪdlɪ] adv. 疲倦地；阴沉地；不感兴趣地；不活泼地==

> A tanned blonde in a bikini swims languidly in the clear swimming pool.

> 一位身穿比基尼泳装、皮肤晒成古铜色的金发女郎在清澈的泳池里慵懒地游着泳。

"Is that where she is?" Cohn turned to me.

"Go to hell!"

"She was with you. Is that where she is?" "Go to hell!"

"I'll make you tell me" — he stepped forward — "you damned pimp."

> ==pimp英 [pɪmp] 美 [pɪmp] n. 男妓，皮条客；妓院老板；引人作坏事的人 vi. 拉皮条；帮助干坏事==

I swung at him and he ducked.

I saw his face duck sideways in the light. He hit me and I sat down on the pavement.

As I started to get on my feet he hit me twice.

I went down backward under a table.

I tried to get up and felt I did not have any legs.

I felt I must get on my feet and try and hit him.

Mike helped me up.

Some one poured a carafe of water on my head.

Mike had an arm around me, and I found I was sitting on a chair.

Mike was pulling at my ears.

"I say, you were cold," Mike said.

"Where the hell were you?"

"Oh, I was around." "You didn't want to mix in it?"

"He knocked Mike down, too," Edna said.

"He didn't knock me out," Mike said."I just lay there."

"Does this happen every night at your fiestas?" Edna asked. "Wasn't that Mr. Cohn?"

"I'm all right," I said. "My head's a little wobbly."

> ==wobbly==
>
> adj. 摇摆的；颤动的；不稳定的；歪斜的（moving unsteadily from side to side）

> wobbly还有“不太好的；不大可能成功的”的意思，比如：
>
> The meeting yesterday got off to a wobblystart. 
>
> 昨天的会议开头不顺利。
>
> 习语：throw a wobbly 指勃然大怒；发脾气
>
> 比如：
>
> John threw a wobbly at work after the boss criticized his report.
>
> 老板批评了他的报告之后，约翰勃然大怒。

There were several waiters and a crowd of people standing around.

"Vaya ([西]滚开) !" said Mike. "Get away. Go on."

The waiters moved the people away.

"It was quite a thing to watch," Edna said. "He must be a boxer."

"He is."

"I wish Bill had been here," Edna said. "I'd like to have seen Bill knocked down, too.

I've always wanted to see Bill knocked down. He's so big."

"I was hoping he would knock down a waiter," Mike said, "and get arrested.

I'd like to see Mr. Robert Cohn in jail."

"No," I said.

"Oh, no," said Edna. "You don't mean that."

"I do, though," Mike said. "I'm not one of these chaps likes being knocked about.

I never play games, even."

Mike took a drink.

"I never liked to hunt, you know.

There was always the danger of having a horse fall on you. How do you feel, Jake?"

"All right." "You're nice," Edna said to Mike. "Are you really a bankrupt?"

"I'm a tremendous bankrupt," Mike said. "I owe money to everybody.

Don't you owe any money?"

"Tons."

"I owe everybody money," Mike said. "I borrowed a hundred pesetas from Montoya to-night."

"The hell you did," I said.

"I'll pay it back," Mike said. "I always pay everything back."

"That's why you're a bankrupt, isn't it?" Edna said.

I stood up. I had heard them talking from a long way away.

It all seemed like some bad play.

"I'm going over to the hotel," I said.

Then I heard them talking about me.

"Is he all right?" Edna asked.

"We'd better walk with him."

"I'm all right," I said. "Don't come. I'll see you all later."

I walked away from the café.

They were sitting at the table.

I looked back at them and at the empty tables.

There was a waiter sitting at one of the tables with his head in his hands.

Walking across the square to the hotel everything looked new and changed.

I had never seen the trees before.

I had never seen the flagpoles before, nor the front of the theatre.

> ==flagpole英 [ˈflægpəʊl] 美 [ˈflægpoʊl] n. 旗杆==

It was all different. I felt as I felt once coming home from an out-of-town football game.

I was carrying a suitcase with my football things in it, and I walked up the street from the station in the town I had lived in all my life and it was all new.

They were raking the lawns and burning leaves in the road, and I stopped for a long time and watched.

Then I went on, and my feet seemed to be a long way off, and everything seemed to come from a long way off, and I could hear my feet walking a great distance away.

> <font color=red>Then I went on, and my feet seemed to be a long way off, and everything seemed to come from a long way off, and I could hear my feet walking a great distance away.</font>
>
> 然后我继续往前走，我的两只脚好像离开我老远，一切似乎都是从远处向我逼近的，我听见从遥远的地方传来我的脚步声。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> a long way off 也就是a long way away. Jake被Cohn那一下打得不轻，所以整个人都晕乎乎的。但这里作者并没有直接用feel dizzy/faint这样的表达，而是描写Jake感觉自己的意识仿佛都离开了身体，所以觉得自己的双脚和脚步声都很遥远（这里也是意识流写作手法的一个体现）。

I had been kicked in the head early in the game.

It was like that crossing the square.

It was like that going up the stairs in the hotel.

Going up the stairs took a long time, and I had the feeling that I was carrying my suitcase.

> <font color=red>It was like that crossing the square. It was like that going up the stairs in the hotel.</font>
>
> 此刻我穿过广场时的感觉就跟那时一个样。我怀着那种感觉走上旅馆的楼梯。
>
> **💧表达精讲**

> 这两句话都可以在It was like that后面断句，crossing...和going up...作伴随状语。其中that是指上文的I had been kicked in the head early in the game. 
>
> 这里that所指代的内容要联系上文来理解：首先是Jake走回旅馆的路上回忆起自己的少年时代，在城外参加完足球比赛后走回家（I felt as I felt once coming home from an out-of-town football game.）当时他在球赛中被球击中了脑门，所以他现在的感觉就像那次一样。

There was a light in the room.

Bill came out and met me in the hall.

"Say," he said, "go up and see Cohn.

He's been in a jam, and he's asking for you."

>  <font color=red>"Say," he said, "go up and see Cohn. He's been in a jam, and he's asking for you."</font>

> be in a jam 形容“处于困境中”（be in trouble, a difficult situation）. 比如：I’m in a bit of a jam. Could you give me a lift to the train station?（我遇上麻烦了。你能顺路捎我去火车站吗？）

"The hell with him." "Go on. Go on up and see him."

I did not want to climb another flight of stairs.

"What are you looking at me that way for?"

"I'm not looking at you. Go on up and see Cohn. He's in bad shape."

> <font color=red>"I'm not looking at you. Go on up and see Cohn. He's in bad shape."</font>
>
> “我没在瞧你。上去看看科恩吧。他的情绪很糟糕。”

> in bad shape 表示“（身体/情绪/状况）很糟糕”（in a bad state of health or in a bad condition）, shape在这里指health/condition. 比如“经济状况糟糕”也可以说The economy is in bad shape.
>
> 这里再为大家补充一个关于shape的表达：sb is in no shape to do sth. 表示某人的身体（因为生病、疲劳、酒醉等）不在状态而无法做某事，比如：Mel was in no shape to drive home after the party.（梅尔在聚会结束后醉得无法开车回家。） 

"You were drunk a little while ago," I said.

"I'm drunk now," Bill said. "But you go up and see Cohn. He wants to see you."

"All right," I said.

It was just a matter of climbing more stairs.

I went on up the stairs carrying my phantom suitcase.

>
> 只不过多爬几层台阶就是了。我提着幻觉中的皮箱继续上楼。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> phantom suitcase 字面上是“幽灵皮箱”，其实就是说Jake觉得上楼很吃力，好像提着一个皮箱一样。phantom在这里可以理解为“虚幻的，幻觉的”（not real, but seeming real to the person affected）.
>
> 此外phantom还可以指“有名无实的”，形容的对象是企业、协议或商品等，比如：A phantom trading scheme at a Wall Street investment bank went unnoticed for three years.（一家华尔街投资银行的虚构的交易方案历经3年都未被察觉。）

I walked down the hall to Cohn's room.

The door was shut and I knocked.

"Who is it?" "Barnes." "Come in, Jake."

I opened the door and went in, and set down my suitcase.

There was no light in the room.

Cohn was lying, face down, on the bed in the dark.

### 背景知识

**💧****Pub、Bar、Speakeasy、Club都指酒吧，它们有什么不同？**

我们的内容中多次出现酒吧的场景，大家经常能够看到bar、pub这类词，今天我们就来一起看一下关于酒吧的单词之间都有哪些差异

**1. Pub** 

Pub一词是public house的简称，是英国的传统酒吧。传统上pub会和各家啤酒厂挂钩，主营某家啤酒厂的啤酒。即使是现在在英国的pub门口也经常见到其售卖的主要啤酒的厂牌。Pub往往以啤酒（beer）为主打，烈酒（spirit）、葡萄酒（wine）或者鸡尾酒（cocktail）也会有，但都比较简单。

Pub里往往大白天就开门迎客，不仅提供酒类，还有各种当地的美食，如炸鱼薯条（Fish & Chip），派（Pie），布丁（Pudding）等传统英国美食都能在pub里看到。这里一般不会有舞池，只会放放背景音乐，偶尔会有乐队演出。大多数的Pub还会带有小花园和露台，夏天在室外喝酒非常享受。

Pub通常是温馨的随意的，人们可以在这里交朋友，英国人常说的let’s talk this over the pub. 就很好地诠释了pub的意境。



**2. Bar**

Bar就是酒吧这个词的来源，本来指的是酒吧里那张吧台。Bar可以是各式各样的，既可以是破破烂烂的小酒吧，也可能是高大上的豪华酒吧，可能是舞厅夜店、也可能是有舞蹈、乐队、戏剧演出的场所。Bar大多分布在城市闹市区，装修更现代化，气氛活跃热闹，是年轻人比较喜欢的社交场所。

Dive bar：这可不是说潜水爱好者的酒吧，而是指简单普通的邻家酒吧，酒水和装修都比较简单，价格经济实惠——想象一下《辛普森一家》里爸爸Homer经常去喝酒的地方。



**3. Speakeasy**

Speakeasy是时下比较流行的一种酒吧，主要提供鸡尾酒和烈酒。Speakeasy源自美国对于无证经营酒吧的称呼。Speakeasy是将speak（说）和easy（轻松）两个词拼在一起，指的是在这样的酒吧内聊天需要低调些。Speakeasy在美国禁酒令时期结束后渐渐消失，直到后来一些酒吧推出复古特色。



**4. Club**

Club其实是night club的简称。Club和其它酒吧的区别在于里面有舞池而座位较少。尽管club的酒不一定不好，高级club里的酒也许还很好很贵，但这里不能算是品酒的地方，跳舞或者看乐队现场演出是来这里的主要目的。

### 课文理解

Jake找到了酒吧外的Bill和Mike（先前他们两个和一个英国来的漂亮姑娘Edna搭讪），Mike因为在酒吧里和别人发生冲突而被警察“请”了出来，而这群来找他茬的英国人很有可能就是他之前的债主——

💧**Clue 1**: Mike has a row with his debtors in the bar.



**Evidence 1**: "They can't insult Mike," Bill said. "Mike is a swell fellow. They can't insult Mike. I won't stand it. Who cares if he is a damn bankrupt?" His voice broke.

“他们不该这样侮辱迈克。”比尔说。“迈克是个大大的好人。他们不该侮辱迈克。我看不下去了 。谁在乎他是个倒霉的破产的人啊？”他的嗓门哽住了。



**Evidence 2**: "There were some people that had known Mike at Cannes. What's the matter with Mike?"

"Probably he owes them money," I said. "That's what people usually get bitter about."

“那边有些人在戛纳就认识迈克。迈克怎么啦？”

“大概他欠他们钱了，”我说。“这种事容易结仇。”



前面的情节已经提过，Mike至今仍然是没有还清债务的一个破产者（“Mr. Campbell is an undischarged bankrupt.”）虽然Mike对是否认识他们矢口在否认，前后文还有两个细节可以证实Mike的欠了确他们书首先



首先是在稍前的部分（Chapter 4.2）, Brett告诉Jake自己如何不愿意跟着伯爵到他提议要带她去的地方，原因是："Then he wanted me to go to Cannes with him. Told him I knew too many people in Cannes. Monte Carlo." 这里提到的戛纳和蒙特卡洛都是度假胜地，而蒙特卡洛（属于摩纳哥，和法国东南部接壤）还是著名的赌城，可以猜测Brett应该是和Mike一起在这些地方都游玩过。



接着是在本章的后半部分（Chapter 17.1）, Bill告诉Jake："Yes. There was a fellow there that had helped pay Brett and Mike out of Cannes, once. He was damned nasty." 可以证实这些英国人的确是Mike的债主。但Bill显然很为Mike打抱不平，甚至说道他宁愿自己也是一个破产者，来给他们一点颜色看（"I wish to hell I was a bankrupt. I'd show those bastards."）是否是因为Bill知道关于Mike更多的隐秘呢？



今天的情节里出现的另外一个冲突发生在Cohn和Jake之间：当Cohn得知Jake让Brett和Romero待在一起的时候，他立马情绪失控——



💧**Clue 2**:  Cohn is provoked by Jake's leaving Brett and Romero alone.



**Evidence 1**: "Oh, go to hell, Cohn," Mike called from the table. "Brett's gone off with the bull-fighter chap. They're on their honeymoon."

“哼，你滚开，科恩，”迈克在桌子那边喊道。“勃莱特跟斗牛的那个小子跑了。他们正在度蜜月哩。”



**Evidence 2**: "I'll make you tell me" — he stepped forward — "you damned pimp."

“我会叫你告诉我的，”——他向前卖了一步——“你这该死的拉皮条的。”



pimp指“皮条客”（someone who pimps gets clients for prostitutes and takes some of the money the prostitutes earn）. 值得注意的是，在Cohn指责Jake的行为无疑是在拉皮条的时候，他也暗示了Brett在这里的身份就相当于娼妓（prostitute）. 这个细节作为伏笔会在接下来的情节里逐渐明朗，并为我们揭示出Brett给这几位角色带来的毁灭性影响。

### 今日彩蛋

💧 **How to Express our Mood Naturally?**

**怎样地道地表达心情？**

我们今天的内容当中用“He's in bad shape.”来形容科恩的情绪很糟糕。当我们表达情绪的时候除了sad，happy这类简单的词，还有哪些地道的英语表达呢，我们今天就来一起学习一下吧。

**1. Pumped Up  对……非常兴奋**

这个词很容易理解，pump是泵，打气筒，气打得很足，那一定情绪很高，所以引申过来，就是很兴奋、跃跃欲试的意思。

Eg: He’s pumped up for his first half-marathon race this weekend.

对于周末的半程马拉松比赛，他特别兴奋。



**2.** **On Cloud Nine  高兴得好像在九霄云上**

这里就体验了中英的互通性。中文里有高兴到九霄云外，相对应的，英文里也有类似的表达，这两种语言异曲同工。

Eg: When he finally proposed to her, she was on cloud nine.

当他最终向她求婚时，她真是高兴到九霄云外了。



**3. Be down in the dumps  感到沮丧、绝望**

in the dumps 直译是“在垃圾堆” 的意思，由此引申为心情乱糟糟的，绝望、低落。

Eg: I always feel down in the dumps when I go back to work after a long weekend.

每次周末过后去上班的时候，我的心情都很低落。



**4. Grief-stricken 极其伤心**

Grief-stricken这种构词法是高档英语的一种标志。

与之相近的词还有：

earth-stricken 遭受地震重创的

poor-stricken 贫穷的

stricken 是 strike 的过去分词，意思是“打击”，grief-stricken 就是被悲伤击中的 那种状态。经历过的人都知道那种无力感、脆弱感。

Eg: After his partner died in a car accident, he was left grief-stricken.

自从他的同伴在车祸中丧生后，他就一直处于悲痛中。



茫然/丧也是现代人的一种心情，来看看怎么说？



**5. Spaced out  梦游，放空**

这就是我们常说的：人在，心不在了。我们都有这种时候，虽然看起来在做事情，但脑子里一片空白，像梦游一般。

Eg: Dave, are you listening? You look totallyspaced out!

戴维，你在听吗？你看上去像在做白日梦。

"Hello, Jake."

"Don't call me Jake."

I stood by the door. It was just like this that I had come home.

Now it was a hot bath that I needed.

A deep, hot bath, to lie back in.

"Where's the bathroom?" I asked.

Cohn was crying. There he was, face down on the bed, crying.

He had on a white polo shirt, the kind he'd worn at Princeton.

"I'm sorry, Jake. Please forgive me."

"Forgive you, hell."

"Please forgive me, Jake."

I did not say anything. I stood there by the door.

"I was crazy. You must see how it was."

"Oh, that's all right."

"I couldn't stand it about Brett."

"You called me a pimp."

I did not care. I wanted a hot bath.

I wanted a hot bath in deep water.

"I know. Please don't remember it. I was crazy."

"That's all right."

He was crying. His voice was funny.

He lay there in his white shirt on the bed in the dark. His polo shirt.

"I'm going away in the morning."

He was crying without making any noise.

"I just couldn't stand it about Brett.

I've been through hell, Jake.

It's been simply hell.

When I met her down here Brett treated me as though I were a perfect stranger.

I just couldn't stand it.

We lived together at San Sebastian.

I suppose you know it. I can't stand it any more."

He lay there on the bed.

"Well," I said, "I'm going to take a bath."

"You were the only friend I had, andI loved Brett so."

"Well," I said, "so long."

"I guess it isn't any use," he said. "I guess it isn't any damn use."

"What?" "Everything. Please say you forgive me, Jake."

"Sure," I said. "It's all right."

"I felt so terribly. I've been through such hell, Jake. Now everything's gone. Everything."

"Well," I said, "so long. I've got to go."

He rolled over sat on the edge of the bed, and then stood up.

"So long, Jake," he said. "You'll shake hands, won't you?"

"Sure. Why not?"

We shook hands. In the dark I couldnot see his face very well.

"Well," I said, "see you in the morning."

"I'm going away in the morning."

"Oh, yes," I said.

I went out. Cohn was standing in the door of the room.

"Are you all right, Jake?" he asked.

"Oh, yes," I said. "I'm all right."

I could not find the bathroom.

After a while I found it.

There was a deep stone tub.

I turned on the taps and the water would not run.

I sat down on the edge of the bath-tub.

When I got up to go I found I had taken off my shoes.

I hunted for them and found them and carried them down-stairs.

I found my room and went inside and undressed and got into bed.

I woke with a headache and the noise of the bands going by in the street.

I remembered I had promised to take Bill's friend Edna to see the bulls go through the street and into the ring.

I dressed and went down-stairs and out into the cold early morning.

People were crossing the square, hurrying toward the bull-ring.

Across the square were the two lines of men in front of the ticket-booths.

They were still waiting for the tickets to go on sale at seven o'clock.

I hurried across the street to the café.

The waiter told me that my friends had been there and gone.

"How many were they?"

"Two gentlemen and a lady."

That was all right.

Bill and Mike were with Edna. She had been afraid last night they would pass out.

That was why I was to be sure to take her.

I drank the coffee and hurried with the other people toward the bull-ring.

I was not groggy now.

There was only a bad headache.

Everything looked sharp and clear, and the town smelt of the early morning.

The stretch of ground from the edge of the town to the bull-ring was muddy.

There was a crowd all along the fence that led to the ring, and the outside balconies and the top of the bull-ring were solid with people.

I heard the rocket and I knew I could not get into the ring in time to see the bulls come in, so I shoved through the crowd to the fence.

I was pushed close against the planks of the fence.

Between the two fences of the runway the police were clearing the crowd along.

They walked or trotted on into the bull-ring.

Then people commenced to come running.

A drunk slipped and fell.

Two policemen grabbed him and rushed him over to the fence.

The crowd were running fast now.

There was a great shout from the crowd, and putting my head through between the boards I saw the bulls just coming out of the street into the long running pen.

They were going fast and gaining on the crowd.

Just then another drunk started out from the fence with a blouse in his hands.

He wanted to do capework with the bulls.

> <font color=red>Just then another drunk started out from the fence with a blouse in his hands. He wanted to do capework with the bulls.</font>

> 就在这关头，另一名醉汉从栅栏边跑过去，双手抓着一件衬衫。他想拿它当斗篷来同牛斗一场指。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①start out  “突然冲出来”（rush out）;
>
> ②with a blouse in his hands 和 do capework比较难理解，为什么这个醉汉要挥动衬衫呢？首先来看capework这个词，我们在前面介绍过，一般斗牛士用来激怒公牛的大红布（斗篷）就叫作cape, 所以do capework就是指这个醉汉像斗牛士挥舞斗篷一样挥舞他的衬衫。

The two policemen tore out, collared him, one hit him with a club, and they dragged him against the fence and stood flattened out against the fence as the last of the crowd and the bulls went by.

> <font color=red>The two policemen tore out, collared him, one hit him with a club, and they dragged him against the fence and stood flattened out against the fence as the last of the crowd and the bulls went by.</font>

>
> **💧表达精讲**

> ①tore out 可以理解为tore out from the crowd “从人群中突然冲出来”，tear常见义是“撕裂，撕碎”，在这里指“奔，冲”（to hurry or rush）, 比如：The door flew open and Miranda tore into the room.（门猛地开了，米兰达冲进了房间。）
>
> ②collar 作名词指“衣领”，作动词可以表示“抓住某人的衣领”，引申为“逮捕，揪住”，比如：The police collared him less than 20 minutes after the robbery.（抢劫发生后，警方不到20分钟就抓到了他。）
>
> ③club 指“大头棒，棍棒”（a thick heavy stick used to hit people）, 但一般常见的用来指警棒的词是baton和truncheon.
>
> ④dragged him against 和 stood flattened out against the fence 中的against都是理解为“倚靠着，紧贴着”；flattened out 指的就是“（整个身子都站直了地）平贴着”。

There were so many people running ahead of the bulls that the mass thickened and slowed up going through the gate into the ring, and as the bulls passed, galloping together, heavy, muddy-sided, horns swinging, one shot ahead, caught a man in the running crowd in the back and lifted him in the air.

> <font color=red>There were / so many people running ahead of the bulls / that the mass thickened / and slowed up going through the gate into the ring, / and as the bulls passed, galloping together, heavy, muddy-sided, horns swinging, / one shot ahead, / caught a man in the running crowd in the back / and lifted him in the air.</font>

> 在牛群前面有那么多人在跑，因此在通过大门进入斗牛场的时候，人群密集起来了，并且放慢了脚步。当笨重的、腰际溅满泥浆的牛群摆动着犄角，一起奔驰过去的时候，有一头牛向前冲过去，在奔跑的人群中用犄角牴中一个人的脊背，把他挑起来。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①the mass thickened “人群密集了起来”，thicken原义是“变厚，变浓”，比如：The fog was beginning to thicken.（雾气渐浓。） 也就是“密度增大”的意思；
>
> ②slow up doing “减慢做某事的速度”，注意slow up和slow down都是“减慢”的意思哦~ 比如：Ian slowed up/down as he approached the traffic lights.（伊恩在驶近红绿灯时放慢了速度。）
>
> ③as the bulls passed, galloping together, heavy, muddy-sided, horns swinging 我们单独把这个意群从原本的长句里拿出来看，首先as引导的是时间状语从句，“当……时”，the bulls作主语，谓语是passed, 而后面的部分其实都可以统一看成the bulls的修饰成分：
>
> galloping together “一起奔驰”；heavy “笨重的”；muddy-sided “两侧激起泥浆”；“horns swinging” 可以理解为省略了前面的with “犄角摆动着”。

Both the man's arms were by his sides, his head went back as the horn went in, and the bull lifted him and then dropped him.

The bull picked another man running in front, but the man disappeared into the crowd, and the crowd was through the gate and into the ring with the bulls behind them.

The red door of the ring went shut, the crowd on the outside balconies of the bull-ring were pressing through to the inside, there was a shout, then another shout.

The man who had been gored lay face down in the trampled mud.

> Don’t let people trample all over you. 
>
> 不要任人踩在你头上。

People climbed over the fence, and I could not see the man because the crowd was so thick around him.

From inside the ring came the shouts.

Each shout meant a charge by some bull into the crowd.

> <font color=red>Each shout meant a charge by some bull into the crowd.</font>
>
> 每一声叫喊都说明有牛冲入人群。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> charge 在这里作名词，意思是“（士兵或动物的）猛冲，冲锋”（an attack in which soldiers or animals move towards someone or something very quickly）. 它作动词的时候也可以表示相同的意思，比如：Then, with a final effort, our men charged the enemy for the last time.（于是我们的士兵拼尽全力，向敌人发起了最后一次冲锋。） 

You could tell by the degree of intensity in the shout how bad a thing it was that was happening.

Then the rocket went up that meant the steers had gotten the bulls out of the ring and into the corrals.

I left the fence and started back toward the town.

Back in the town I went to the café to have a second coffee and some buttered toast.

The waiters were sweeping out the café and mopping off the tables.

One came over and took my order.

"Anything happen at the encierro ([西]把牛圈入牛栏)?"

"I didn't see it all. One man was badly cogido ([西]牴伤)."

"Where?" "Here."

I put one hand on the small of my back and the other on my chest, where it looked as though the horn must have come through.

The waiter nodded his head and swept the crumbs from the table with his cloth.

> ==crumb英 [krʌm] 美 [krʌm] n. 碎屑（尤指面包屑或糕饼屑）；面包心；些许，少许；<俚>可鄙的人物 v. 捏碎，弄碎；[烹]裹上面包屑用油煎==

"Badly cogido," he said. "All for sport. All for pleasure."

He went away and came back with the long-handled coffee and milk pots.

He poured the milk and coffee.

It came out of the long spouts in two streams into the big cup. The waiter nodded his head.

> ==spout英 [spaʊt] 美 [spaʊt] n. 喷口，喷嘴；水柱，喷流；（鲸类的）喷水孔；[气]龙卷 vt.& vi. 喷出；喷射；滔滔不绝地讲；把…典当掉 vi. 喷出；喷射；滔滔不绝地讲==

"Badly cogido through the back," he said.

He put the pots down on the table and sat down in the chair at the table.

"A big horn wound. All for fun. Just for fun. What do you think of that?"

"I don't know." "That's it. All for fun. Fun, you understand."

"You're not an aficionado?"

"Me? What are bulls? Animals. Brute animals."

He stood up and put his hand on the small of his back.

"Right through the back. A cornada ([西]动物角牴的伤) right through the back. For fun — you understand."

He shook his head and walked away, carrying the coffee-pots.

Two men were going by in the street.

The waiter shouted to them. They were grave-looking.

One shook his head. "Muerto ([西]死了)!" he called.

The waiter nodded his head.

The two men went on. They were on some errand.

The waiter came over to my table.

"You hear? Muerto. Dead. He's dead.

With a horn through him. All for morning fun. Es muy flamenco ([西]真是非常地弗朗明科)."

> <font color=red>"You hear? Muerto. Dead. He's dead. With a horn through him. All for morning fun. Es muy flamenco."</font>
>
> “你听见啦？死了！死了。他死了。让牛角扎穿了。全是为了开心一个早晨。真太荒唐了。”
>
> **💧知识拓展**
>
> 为什么这个侍从要说“这真是太弗拉明科了”（Es muy flamenco）呢？首先弗拉明科（flamenco）是安达卢西亚赛人（弗拉明科人）的一种特色鲜明的音乐和舞蹈形式；并且传统的弗拉明科非常注重要有所谓的“杜安德”（duende），这是西班牙民间信仰中的一个不邪恶的魔神，它代表着“狂热”和“强烈的冲击力”；同时弗拉明科还伴随着“哈列奥”（jaleo），即“拍手，捻指和激动的喊叫”。
>
> 所以服务生这么说的意思就是“这个人的行为太疯魔了”（居然敢去惹公牛）。

"It's bad." "Not for me," the waiter said. "No fun in that for me."

Later in the day we learned that the man who was killed was named Vicente Girones, and came from near Tafalla.

The next day in the paper we read that he was twenty-eight years old, and had a farm, a wife, and two children.

He had continued to come to the fiesta each year after he was married.

The next day his wife came in from Tafalla to be with the body, and the day after there was a service in the chapel of San Fermin, and the coffin was carried to the railway-station by members of the dancing and drinking society of Tafalla.

The drums marched ahead, and there was music on the fifes, and behind the men who carried the coffin walked the wife and two children.. . .

Behind them marched all the members of the dancing and drinking societies of Pamplona, Estella, Tafalla, and Sanguesa who could stay over for the funeral.

The coffin was loaded into the baggage-car of the train, and the widow and the two children rode, sitting, all three together, in an openthird-class railway carriage.

The train started with a jerk, and then ran smoothly, going down grade around the edge of the plateau and out into the fields of grain that blew in the wind on the plain on the way to Tafalla.

The bull who killed Vicente Girones was named Bocanegra, was Number 118 of the bull-breeding establishment of Sanchez Taberno, and was killed by Pedro Romero as the third bull of that same afternoon.

His ear was cut by popular acclamation and given to Pedro Romero, who, in turn, gave it to Brett, who wrapped it in a handkerchief belonging to myself, and left both ear and handkerchief, along with a number of Muratti cigarette-stubs,

shoved far back in the drawer of thebed-table that stood beside her bed in the Hotel Montoya, in Pamplona.

### 背景知识

**💧****Coffee in Spain**

**西班牙的咖啡文化**

我们今天的内容中出现了侍者倒咖啡的场景，他拿着长把的咖啡壶和牛奶壶，使牛奶和咖啡从两个长壶嘴里分两股倒入大杯里。（He went away and came back with the long-handled coffee and milk pots. He poured the milk and coffee. It came out of the long spouts in two streams into the big cup.）

西班牙有自己独特而丰富的咖啡文化。据调查，80%的西班牙人每天喝咖啡。大街上咖啡馆林立，可以说是三步之内必有一家咖啡馆。

在咖啡厅里即便是点一杯普通的牛奶咖啡，服务生也会问得很仔细，比如“ 加什么样的牛奶？凉的，常温的，热的，发烫的，全脂的（full-fat），半脱脂的（semi-skimmed），全脱脂的（skimmed）？”; 再比如“要糖吗？普通白糖（white sugar)，红糖（brown sugar)，还是甜味剂(sweetening agent)？”

\1. Tricolor,  Barcelona
三色体（巴塞罗那）

咖啡配白兰地、奶泡（milk foam ）和肉桂粉（ground cinnamon）↓



\2. Carajillo, Barcelona

小惊讶（巴塞罗那）

咖啡配朗姆酒（rum ）等烈酒↓



\3. Barraquito, Tenerife

巴拉奇托（特内里费）

浓缩咖啡配牛奶，肉桂粉，柠檬和Licor 43↓



\4. Blanco y negro, Valencia

黑白配（巴伦西亚）

冰咖啡（iced coffee）配奶油（cream）↓



\5. Café al tizón, Galicia

 炭火咖啡（加利西亚）

将木炭（charcoal ）直接放入咖啡烧制↓



和英美的咖啡比，西班牙咖啡用的杯子要小些，一杯普通的牛奶咖啡大概是200毫升左右。而且西班牙人对于咖啡、水和牛奶的比例搭配有细致的区分。国内流行的美式咖啡，对于一些传统的西班牙咖啡爱好者来说，这是用大量的水冲出来的咖啡，失去了咖啡的醇厚香味， 只能称为“脏水”。



大家如果到了西班牙旅行，可以品尝一下那里独具特色的咖啡哦！

### 课文理解

Jake回到旅馆后，Bill 告知他Cohn希望能和他见一面。Cohn为自己打了Jake并且辱骂他是个皮条客而表示歉意。但在他身上的另一个戏剧性变化是，他终于意识到Brett对自己不待见，并且这段时间以来他受的折磨已经让他近乎崩溃了——



💧**Clue 1**: Cohn experiences a break-down.



**Evidence 1**: "I just couldn't stand it about Brett. I've been through hell, Jake. It's been simply hell. When I met her down here Brett treated me as though I were a perfect stranger. I just couldn't stand it. We lived together at San Sebastian. I suppose you know it. I can't stand it any more."

“一想到勃莱特，我就受不了。我经受了百般煎熬，杰克。简直是活受罪。我在这儿跟勃莱特相会以来，她待我如同陌路人一般。我实在受不了啦。我们在圣塞瓦斯蒂安同居过。我想你知道这件事。我再也受不了了。”



**Evidence 2**: "I felt so terribly. I've been through such hell, Jake. Now everything's gone. Everything."

“我心情糟糕透了。我这一向就像在地狱里，杰克。现在一切都完了，所有的一切。”



自从他们在潘普洛纳重聚后，Brett对他完全就像个陌生人一样（a perfect stranger, perfect表示“完全的，十足的”）。这点已经在前文得到了Brett的亲口验证（"You know I do know how he feels. He can't believe it didn't mean anything."）



另一个有意思的地方是，更应该崩溃的其实是Jake，但这里对于他的心理活动并没有过多的描写，只写到他回房间后昏昏沉沉地睡过去了（I found my room and went inside and undressed and got into bed）.



今天在斗牛比赛前还发生了一起意外，一个男子被公牛用角挑起并且牴死了。随后公牛又继续向围观群众发动攻击，最后只得由犍牛来把这些公牛从斗牛场上赶回到牛圈里（Then the rocket went up that meant the steers had gotten the bulls out of the ring and into the corrals）. 



Jake回到镇上的咖啡馆里，和服务生提起这回事。这位服务生显然并不是一个斗牛爱好者（non-aficionado）, 所以在他看来，斗牛本来就是一项很危险的活动，并且只是为了满足人们消解无聊的需要——



💧**Clue 2**:  Bullfight is only a brute game for killing time.



**Evidence 1**: "Badly cogido," he said. "All for sport. All for pleasure."

“伤得很重。”他说。“光是为了解闷儿，光是为了取乐。”



**Evidence 2**: "Me? What are bulls? Animals. Brute animals." He stood up and put his hand on the small of his back. "Right through the back. A cornada right through the back. For fun — you understand."

“我吗？牛是啥？牲畜。残暴的牲畜。”他站起来，把一只手按在后腰上。“正好扎透脊背。扎透脊背的牴伤。只是为了好玩——你明白的。”



当这位侍者问Jake怎么想的时候，他没有直接回答（"What do you think of that?" "I don't know."）只是反问他是否并不是斗牛爱好者（"You're not an aficionado?"）Jake在这里的态度非常暧昧不明。最后他提到了报纸上报道的关于这个被挑死的男子的姓名以及家庭背景，以及这头致人死命的公牛最后在斗牛场上被Romero刺死了，被割下来的牛关于耳还送给了Brett. 



这次斗牛场上的意外在明天的内容里会继续提及并且还会有和Cohn相关的重要信息出现（比如在他揍了Jake之后又去了哪里，以至于他最后在旅馆房间里告诉Jake自己要永远离开了）。

### 今日彩蛋

💧**Superstitions and Taboos of the Western People**

**西方人的迷信和禁忌**



我们之前的内容中提到了Knock on wood的迷信习俗，今天我们一起来看一下西方人还有哪些迷信和禁忌。



\1. 打翻盐 （spill salt）

意味着坏运气，人们认为盐是不能亵渎的，这个迷信来源于《圣经》。盐纯净，因此成为正直廉洁的象征，把盐放在桌上乃公正的标志，一旦打翻是对不公正的警示和告诫。在达芬奇创作的《最后的晚餐》（*The Last Supper*） 中，基督和使徒的脸上明显带着惊恐和悲伤，历史学家认为是因为犹大打翻了盐瓶。一旦撒出了盐，你应该拿一撮盐往你的左肩抛去，抛到魔鬼的脸上。



\2. 遇到黑猫（meet the black cat）

虽然埃及人（Egyptian）认为猫是神明再世，但几个世纪之后，英国教会认为，猫是魔鬼（devil）的再世，应该被烧死。而黑色又是夜晚的颜色。在欧洲和北美，都认为黑猫离你而去的话，会带来厄运，向你走来的话，会带来好运。爱·伦坡（Edger Allen Poe）有一部经典短篇恐怖小说就是《黑猫》（*The Black Cat*）.



\3. 打喷嚏 （sneeze ）

在打喷嚏之后要说Jesus. 因为打喷嚏是很多疾病的开始，所以要向上帝祈求，保佑身体健康。也有种说法是为了防止魔鬼从口入，打喷嚏的时候，用手捂住你的嘴，也可以防止灵魂外逃。



\4. 星期二、五和数字13 （Tuesday，Friday and Number 13）

数字13会带来厄运的说法源自“最后的晚餐”，耶稣被出卖了。人们相信，13个人在同一张桌子上吃饭，其中的一个人会在一年中死去。至于一周中最不幸的一天各地不相同：在西班牙、墨西哥和希腊，人们忌讳周二和13；在其他英语国家，人们不喜欢周五和13，因为周五是耶稣受刑的日子。每逢13号的礼拜五，人们普遍都会焦虑。很多机场没有13号登机口，很多宾馆也没有13楼。



\5. 交叉手指 （cross fingers ）

预示着好运气。在基督教时代之前，存在一个习俗——两人交叉食指，形成一个十字（cross），用来表达愿望，这能带给对方精神支持。十字也是完美的象征，可以传递信念的力量。这个习惯如今已经有所简化：单手交叉食指（index finger ）和中指 （middle finger）.



\6. 打碎镜子（Break the mirror）

据说打碎镜子会造成长达7年的噩运。镜子是用来占卜（divination）的，因此如果镜子坏了，是为了避免展现未来的凶险。7年是人体再生的一个周期。

## Chapter 17.3

Back in the hotel, the night watchman was sitting on a bench inside the door.

He had been there all night and was very sleepy.

He stood up as I came in.

Three of the waitresses came in at the same time.

They had been to the morning show at the bull-ring.

They went upstairs laughing.

I followed them up-stairs and went into my room.

I took off my shoes and lay down on the bed.

The window was open onto the balcony and the sunlight was bright in the room.

I did not feel sleepy.

It must have been half past three o'clock when I had gone to bed and the bands had waked me at six.

My jaw was sore on both sides.

I felt it with my thumb and fingers.

That damn Cohn. He should have hit somebody the first time he was insulted, and then gone away.

He was so sure that Brett loved him.

He was going to stay, and true love would conquer all.

Some one knocked on the door.

"Come in." It was Bill and Mike. They sat down on the bed.

"Some encierro ([西]牛圈)," Bill said."Some encierro."

"I say, weren't you there?" Mike asked. "Ring for some beer, Bill."

"What a morning!" Bill said.

He mopped off his face. "My God! what a morning!

And here's old Jake. Old Jake, the human punching-bag."

> <font color=red>"My God! what a morning! And here's old Jake. Old Jake, the human punching-bag."</font>

>
> *这里把Jake形容为the human punching-bag是因为他在前一天晚上挨了Cohn一拳，Bill调侃他被Cohn这个拳击手当成沙袋来练习拳击了。

"What happened inside?"

"Good God!" Bill said, "what happened, Mike?"

"There were these bulls coming in," Mike said. "Just ahead of them was the crowd, and some chap tripped and brought the whole lot of them down."

>  <font color=red>Just ahead of them was the crowd, and some chap tripped and brought the whole lot of them down.</font>

>
> ③the whole lot of 表示全部，例如：The whole lot of them, from Citigroup to Morgan Stanley and Bank of America, all got whacked today.（从花旗集团到摩根士丹利和美国银行，所有这些银行今天都遭受了重创。）

"And the bulls all came in right over them," Bill said.

"I heard them yell."

"That was Edna," Bill said.

"Chaps kept coming out and waving their shirts."

"One bull went along the barrera and hooked everybody over."

"They took about twenty chaps to the infirmary," Mike said.

"What a morning!" Bill said. "The damn police kept arresting chaps that wanted to go and commit suicide with the bulls."

> <font color=red>"What a morning!" Bill said. "The damn police kept arresting chaps that wanted to go and commit suicide with the bulls."</font>

"The steers took them in, in the end," Mike said.

"It took about an hour."

"It was really about a quarter of an hour" Mike objected.

"Oh, go to hell," Bill said. "You've been in the war.

It was two hours and a half for me."

"Where's that beer?" Mike asked.

"What did you do with the lovely Edna?"

"We took her home just now. She's gone to bed."

"How did she like it?"

"Fine. We told her it was just like that every morning."

"She was impressed," Mike said.

"She wanted us to go down in the ring, too," Bill said. "She likes action."

"I said it wouldn't be fair to my creditors," Mike said.

>
> *Bill在这里说的“我们”是指他还有和Edna同伙的英国人（他们碰巧是Mike的债主），所以Mike说“不公道”是调侃如果他们真的被拉到场子底下没了命，他就不用还债了。

"What a morning," Bill said. "And what a night!"

"How's your jaw, Jake?" Mike asked.

"Sore," I said. Bill laughed.

"Why didn't you hit him with a chair?"

"You can talk," Mike said. "He'd have knocked you out, too.

I never saw him hit me.

I rather think I saw him just before, and then quite suddenly I was sitting down in the street, and Jake was lying under a table."

"Where did he go afterward?" I asked.

"Here she is," Mike said. "Here's the beautiful lady with the beer."

The chambermaid put the tray with the beer-bottles and glasses down on the table.

> ==chambermaid英 [ˈtʃeɪmbəmeɪd] 美 [ˈtʃeɪmbərmeɪd] n. （打扫宾馆客房的）女服务员==

"Now bring up three more bottles," Mike said.

"Where did Cohn go after he hit me?" I asked Bill.

"Don't you know about that?" Mike was opening a beer-bottle.

He poured the beer into one of the glasses, holding the glass close to the bottle.

"Really?" Bill asked.

"Why he went in and found Brett and the bull-fighter chap in the bull-fighter's room, and then he massacred the poor, bloody bull-fighter."

"No." "Yes."

"What a night!" Bill said.

"He nearly killed the poor, bloody bull-fighter.

Then Cohn wanted to take Brett away.

Wanted to make an honest woman of her, I imagine. Damned touching scene."

He took a long drink of the beer.

"He is an ass." "What happened?"

"Brett gave him what for. She told him off. I think she was rather good."

"I'll bet she was," Bill said.

"Then Cohn broke down and cried, and wanted to shake hands with the bull-fighter fellow.

He wanted to shake hands with Brett, too."

"I know. He shook hands with me."

"Did he? Well, they weren't having any of it.

The bull-fighter fellow was rather good.

He didn't say much, but he kept getting up and getting knocked down again.

Cohn couldn't knock him out. It must have been damned funny."

"Where did you hear all this?"

"Brett. I saw her this morning."

"What happened finally?"

"It seems the bull-fighter fellow was sitting on the bed.

He'd been knocked down about fifteen times, and he wanted to fight some more.

Brett held him and wouldn't let him get up.

He was weak, but Brett couldn't hold him, and he got up.

Then Cohn said he wouldn't hit him again.

Said he couldn't do it. Said it would be wicked.

So the bull-fighter chap sort of rather staggered over to him. Cohn went back against the wall.

"'So you won't hit me?'

"'No,' said Cohn. 'I'd be ashamed to.'

"So the bull-fighter fellow hit him just as hard as he could in the face,and then sat down on the floor.

He couldn't get up, Brett said.

Cohn wanted to pick him up and carry him to the bed.

He said if Cohn helped him he'd kill him, and he'd kill him anyway this morning if Cohn wasn't out of town.

Cohn was crying, and Brett had told him off, and he wanted to shake hands. I've told you that before."

"Tell the rest," Bill said.

"It seems the bull-fighter chap was sitting on the floor.

He was waiting to get strength enough to get up and hit Cohn again.

Brett wasn't having any shaking hands, and Cohn was crying and telling her how much he loved her, and she was telling him not to be a ruddy ass.

> ==ruddy英 [ˈrʌdi] 美 [ˈrʌdi] adj. 红润的，血色好的；〈俚〉可恶的 adv. 非常 vt. 使变红==

Then Cohn leaned down to shake hands with the bull-fighter fellow.

No hard feelings, you know. All for forgiveness.

And the bull-fighter chap hit him in the face again."

"That's quite a kid," Bill said.

"He ruined Cohn," Mike said. "You know I don't think Cohn will ever want to knock people about again."

"When did you see Brett?"

"This morning. She came in to get some things.

She's looking after this Romero lad."

He poured out another bottle of beer.

"Brett's rather cut up. But she loves looking after people.

"I know," I said.

"I'm rather drunk," Mike said. "I think I'll stay rather drunk.

This is all awfully amusing, but it's not too pleasant. It's not too pleasant for me."

He drank off the beer.

"I gave Brett what for, you know.

I said if she would go about with Jews and bull-fighters and such people, she must expect trouble."

He leaned forward. "I say, Jake, do you mind if I drink that bottle of yours? She'll bring you another one."

"Please," I said. "I wasn't drinking it,anyway."

Mike started to open the bottle. "Would you mind opening it?"

I pressed up the wire fastener and poured it for him.

"You know," Mike went on, "Brett was rather good. She's always rather good.

I gave her a fearful hiding about Jews and bullfighters, and all those sort of people, and do you know what she said: 'Yes. I've had such a hell of a happy life with the British aristocracy!'

She hasn't had an absolutely happy life, Brett.

Damned shame, too. She enjoys things so."

He stood up. His hand was shaky.

"I'm going in the room. Try and get a little sleep."

He smiled.

"We go too long without sleep in these fiestas.

I'm going to start now and get plenty of sleep.

Damn bad thing not to get sleep.

Makes you frightfully nervy."

"We'll see you at noon at the Iruña,"Bill said.

Mike went out the door. We heard him in the next room.

He rang the bell and the chambermaid came and knocked at the door.

"Bring up half a dozen bottles of beer and a bottle of Fundador," Mike told her.

"Si, Señorito ([西] 是，少爷)."

"I'm going to bed," Bill said.

"Poor old Mike. I had a hell of a rowabout him last night."

"Where? At that Milano place?"

"Yes. There was a fellow there that had helped pay Brett and Mike out of Cannes, once. He was damned nasty."

"I know the story."

"I didn't. Nobody ought to have a right to say things about Mike."

"That's what makes it bad."

"They oughtn't to have any right.

I wish to hell they didn't have any right. I'm going to bed."

"Was anybody killed in the ring?"

"I don't think so. Just badly hurt."

"A man was killed outside in the runway."

"Was there?" said Bill.

### 背景知识

**💧The conflicting British and Jews**

**英国人和犹太人有什么恩怨纠葛**

在我们的内容当中，科恩因为犹太人的身份经常受到英国人迈克的鄙视和不公平的对待。那么英国人和犹太人之间为什么会是存在这样的关系呢？

在以色列（Israel）建国以前，犹太人零散的分布在世界各地，一千七百多年的时间里，他们遭到了80多个国家的驱赶，成为了居无定所的游民（vagrant ）. 19世纪末期，一批犹太人来到巴勒斯坦（Palestine）, 在一战中组建军队协助英军打击奥斯曼土耳其（Ottoman Turks）而获得英国人信赖，英国也随后批准犹太人在巴勒斯坦地区建立家园。

随后欧洲出现了大规模的反犹太浪潮（anti-semitism）, 俄国、法国、德国和东欧地区，相继出现大规模迫害犹太人的事件，导致整个欧洲大陆形成了歧视犹太人的风气，因此出现了犹太复国主义（Zionism）.

二战期间大量犹太人选择偷渡至巴勒斯坦。无奈的是英军严密的封锁了巴勒斯坦海岸，只有少部分犹太人成功，大量犹太人只能在海上观望巴勒斯坦，最后伤心的离去。英国人一手帮助自己建立家园，又将自己拒之门外。

英国击沉一艘犹太人偷渡货船，造成了250名犹太人死亡的惨剧。此次事件让犹太人和英国的关系降到冰点，犹太人地下组织也就此对英国人展开了报复。

丘吉尔的好朋友遭到犹太人暗杀，于是8万英军浩浩荡荡开进了巴勒斯坦地区，大批犹太人激进分子被抓。犹太人也不甘示弱，秘密炸毁了英军驻巴勒斯坦司令部，造成大量英国人死亡。

二战结束后，盟军在德国集中营释放了数以万计的犹太人，但是犹太人的安置问题却成了一个头疼问题，西方各国都不愿意接纳，英则把责任推给了联合国。

### 课文理解

Jake回到旅馆，Bill和Mike也正好从斗牛比赛的现场回来，他们还提到当时捣乱的年轻人里就有Edna的同伴（也就是Mike的债主们）。接着Jake从Mike那里得知，Cohn在那晚揍了他之后又气冲冲地去找Brett和Romero，扬言要把Brett带走，甚至出手狠狠地打了Romero, 还差点酿成悲剧——

💧**Clue 1**: Cohn tries to take Brett away and kill Romero that night.



**Evidence 1**: "Why he went in and found Brett and the bull-fighter chap in the bull-fighter'sroom, and then he massacred the poor, bloody bull-fighter."

“唉，他回到旅馆，在斗牛小子的房间里找到了他跟勃莱特，接着差点就杀了那个可怜又该死的斗牛士。”



**Evidence 2**: Brett wasn't having any shaking hands, and Cohn was crying and telling her how much he loved her, and she was telling him not to be a ruddy ass.

勃莱特压根不跟他握什么手，科恩就哭天抹泪地跟她说他多么爱她，她就跟他说别再像头蠢驴一样了。



在这之前，Cohn一直都沉浸在美好的幻想里（He was going to stay, and true love would conquer all）, 所以他默默忍耐着自己从Mike那儿受到的屈辱，但知道了Brett和Romero也纠缠在一起了的时候，他便恼羞成怒，出手打了Jake，这和本书开篇提到的他从不在拳击赛场外和人动手形成了鲜明对比（...being very shy and a thoroughly nice boy, he never fought except in the gym）.



但当Cohn天真地以为Brett会跟他一起走的时候（"Wanted to make an honest woman of her, I imagine. Damned touching scene"）, Brett反而让他滚开（"Brett gave him what for. She told him off"）. 最后他跟Romero来回互相打了几拳，下手都不轻。后面的情节紧接着我们昨天读到的内容：Cohn告诉Jake再也受不了要马上离开了（"I'm going away in the morning." He was crying without making any noise.）



关于Mike和Brett之间的关系在今天的情节里也有了说明：Brett当时在照顾受伤的Mike（"That's how we came to go off together. She was looking after me."）这和Brett跟Jake认识的经过相仿（Brett在一战中担任志愿护士）。Mike非常同情Brett和第一任丈夫的婚姻并不幸福，但同时也对她总是和犹太人以及斗牛士们混在一起很生气（"I said if she would go about with Jews and bull-fighters and such people, she must expect trouble"）. 为此，Mike总是为了Brett伤透心而喝得烂醉来麻痹痛苦——



💧**Clue 2**: Mike tries to numb his pain with liquor.



**Evidence 1**: "I'm rather drunk," Mike said. "I think I'll stay rather drunk. This is all awfully amusing, but it's not too pleasant. It's not too pleasant for me."

“我醉得不行了。”迈克说。“我想我会一直这么醉着。这整件事真是好玩，可是一点也不让人开心。对我来说太不开心了。”



**Evidence 2**: Mike started to open the bottle. "Would you mind opening it?" I pressed up the wire fastener and poured it for him.

迈克尔动手开酒瓶，“你帮我开一下行不行？”我压一下铁丝钩扣，把瓶盖打开，给他倒了一杯。



我们在前面提到，Mike两次向Cohn恶言相向，很大程度上来源于他在Brett面前的不安全感。这次Brett和Romero的私情对他来说更加无法承受，他只能继续用酒精麻痹自己。他喝到了什么程度呢？最后连酒瓶也没法打开而要求Jake帮忙。对于Brett的不忠，Mike只能容忍退让，但自己又饱受痛苦（这也解释了为什么Mike从在本书中一出场就是一个“嗜酒之徒”的形象）。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧The US Personal Bankruptcy**

**美国个人破产制度**

Mike因为破产欠了一大堆债，一直都没还清，到哪都说自己是undischarged bankrupt（“未偿清债务的破产者”） 。其实在美国，符合条件的个人破产者还可以申请破产，今天我们一起来了解一下美国的个人破产的制度吧~

首先个人破产制度在古希腊时期就有了雏形。在当时，如果个人没有办法还清债务，那么该人及其直系亲属（immediate family）就会一同被贬为奴隶身份（to be forced into slavery）, 直到他们所做的苦力可以抵偿欠下的债务为止（until the debt was worked off）.

而美国则是从1978年开始将消费者破产纳入破产法之中（以前只有企业破产）。所谓个人破产（personal bankruptcy）, 是指当个人资产远小于负债并且无力偿还时向法院申请破产，并接受法院对其财产进行清算（liquidation）和分配或者进行债务调整（reorganization）.

美国对个人破产的规定适用于三种债务人（debtor）:

\1. 消费债务人，主要指为自己、子女或家属的用途承担的金钱债务，一般因过度的消费引起破产。

\2. 营业债务人，指在营业中承担债务的合伙、个人等。

\3. 混合债务人，是指个人债务人有时兼有消费者债务和营业债务，在程序上适用个人破产程序。



以下是美国个人破产相关的一些其他制度：

自由财产制度（the exempt property system）

自由财产是指不属于个人破产财产范围、不受破产程序执行、能够由债务人自由支配的个人合法财产。其目的不仅是为破产人今后的生活提供基本的保障，而且也是保障宪法所要求的“健康而富有文化性的最低生活，并使破产人作为健全的市民有可能重新起步”。



个人破产和解制度（personal bankruptcy conciliation system）

在统一的破产法中确立和解制度是美国首创的立法方式，也是美国破产法的显著特征。适用条件：债务人为个人；债务人有固定收入，包括工资、短期薪金、企业年度分红等；确定的无担保的债务不超过 25 万美元，确定的有担保的债务不超过 75 万美元；债务人必须出于诚信（honest and unfortunate debtor）等等。



个人破产免责制度（personal bankruptcy discharge system）

免责制度是指在破产程序终结后，对于破产人未能依破产程序清偿的债务，依照破产法的规定，在何种条件下和什么范围内予以免除继续清偿责任的制度。



总结一下，个人破产制度并不意味着就可以欠钱不还了，而是说可以有条件的进行债务免除，从而保证个人的生存权利。毕竟个人破产其实就是信用破产，这也意味着，再进行债务和债权的追缴其实已经没有太大的价值了。

At noon we were all at the café. It was crowded.

We were eating shrimps and drinking beer. The town was crowded.

Every street was full. Big motor-carsfrom Biarritz and San Sebastian kept driving up and parking around the square.

They brought people for the bullfight. Sight-seeing cars came up,too.

There was one with twenty-five English women in it.

They sat in the white car and looked through their glasses at the fiesta.

The dancers were all quite drunk. It was the last day of the fiesta.

The fiesta was solid and unbroken, but the motor-cars and tourist-cars made little islands of onlookers.

When the cars emptied, the onlookers were absorbed into the crowd.

You did not see them again except as sport clothes, odd-looking at a table among the closely packed peasants in black smocks.

The fiesta absorbed even the Biarritz English so that you did not see them unless you passed close to a table.

All the time there was music in the street. The drums kept on pounding and the pipes were going.

Inside the cafés men with their hands gripping the table, or on each other's shoulders, were singing the hard-voiced singing.

"Here comes Brett," Bill said.

I looked and saw her coming through the crowd in the square, walking, her head up, as though thebfiesta were being staged in her honor, and she found it pleasant and amusing.

"Hello, you chaps!" she said. "I say, I have a thirst."

"Get another big beer," Bill said to the waiter.

"Shrimps?"

"Is Cohn gone?" Brett asked.

"Yes," Bill said. "He hired a car."

The beer came. Brett started to lift the glass mug and her hand shook

She saw it and smiled, and leaned forward and took a long sip.

"Good beer." "Very good," I said. I was nervous about Mike.

I did not think he had slept. He must have been drinking all the time, but he seemed to be under control.

"I heard Cohn had hurt you, Jake," Brett said.

"No. Knocked me out. That was all."

"I say, he did hurt Pedro Romero," Brett said. "He hurt him most badly."

"How is he?" "He'll be all right. He won't go out of the room."

"Does he look badly?" "Very. He was really hurt. I told him I wanted to pop out and see you chaps for a minute."

"Is he going to fight?" "Rather. I'm going with you, if you don't mind."

"How's your boy friend?" Mike asked. He had not listened to anything that Brett had said.

"Brett's got a bull-fighter," he said. "She had a Jew named Cohn, but he turned out badly."

Brett stood up. "I am not going to listen to that sort of rot from you, Michael."

"How's your boy friend?" "Damned well," Brett said. "Watch him this afternoon."

"Brett's got a bull-fighter," Mike said."A beautiful, bloody bullfighter."

"Would you mind walking over with me? I want to talk to you, Jake."

"Tell him all about your bull-fighter," Mike said. "Oh, to hell with your bull-fighter!"

He tipped the table so that all the beers and the dish of shrimps went over in a crash.

"Come on," Brett said. "Let's get out of this."

In the crowd crossing the square I said: "How is it?"

"I'm not going to see him after lunch until the fight.

His people come in and dress him. They're very angry about me, he says."

Brett was radiant. She was happy. The sun was out and the day was bright.

"I feel altogether changed," Brett said. "You've no idea, Jake."

"Anything you want me to do?" "No,just go to the fight with me."

"We'll see you at lunch?" "No. I'm eating with him."

We were standing under the arcade at the door of the hotel.

They were carrying tables out and setting them up under the arcade.

"Want to take a turn out to the park?" Brett asked.

"I don't want to go up yet. I fancy he's sleeping."

We walked along past the theatre and out of the square and along through the barracks of the fair, moving with the crowd between the lines of booths.

We came out on a cross-street that led to the Paseo de Sarasate (萨拉萨特大道).

We could see the crowd walking there, all the fashionably dressed people.

They were making the turn at the upper end of the park.

"Don't let's go there," Brett said. "I don't want staring at just now."

We stood in the sunlight. It was hot and good after the rain and the clouds from the sea.

"I hope the wind goes down," Brett said. "It's very bad for him." "So do I."

"He says the bulls are all right." "They're good."

"Is that San Fermin's?" Brett looked at the yellow wall of the chapel.

"Yes. Where the show started on Sunday."

"Let's go in. Do you mind? I'd rather like to pray a little for him or something."

We went in through the heavy leather door that moved very lightly.

It was dark inside. Many people were praying.

You saw them as your eyes adjusted themselves to the half-light.

We knelt at one of the long wooden benches.

After a little I felt Brett stiffen besideme, and saw she was looking straight ahead.

"Come on," she whispered throatily. "Let's get out of here. Makes me damned nervous."

> ==throatily英 ['θrəʊtɪlɪ] 美 ['θroʊtɪlɪ] adv. 喉音地，嘶哑地==

Outside in the hot brightness of the Street Brett looked up at the tree-tops in the wind.

The praying had not been much of a success.

"Don't know why I get so nervy in church," Brett said. "Never does me any good."

We walked along. "I'm damned bad for a religious atmosphere," Brett said. "I've the wrong type of face.

"You know," Brett said, "I'm not worried about him at all. I just feel happy about him."

"Good." "I wish the wind would drop, though."

"It's liable to go down by five o'clock." "Let's hope."

"You might pray," I laughed.

"Never does me any good. I've never gotten anything I prayed for. Have you?"

"Oh, yes." "Oh, rot," said Brett. "Maybe it works for some people, though you don't look very religious,Jake."

"I'm pretty religious." "Oh, rot," said Brett.

"Don't start proselyting to-day. To-day's going to be bad enough as it is."

It was the first time I had seen her in the old happy, careless way since before she went off with Cohn.

We were back again in front of the hotel.

All the tables were set now, and already several were filled with people eating.

"Do look after Mike," Brett said. "Don't let him get too bad."

"Your frients haff gone up-stairs," the German maître d’hôtel said in English.

He was a continual eavesdropper. Brett turned to him:"Thank you so much. Have you anything else to say?"

"No, ma'am." "Good," said Brett.

"Save us a table for three," I said to the German.

"Iss madam eating here?" "No," Brett said.

"Den I think a table for two will be enuff."

"Don't talk to him," Brett said.

"Mike must have been in bad shape," she said on the stairs.

We passed Montoya on the stairs. He bowed and did not smile.

"I'll see you at the café," Brett said. "Thank you, so much, Jake."

We had stopped at the floor our rooms were on.

She went straight down the hail and into Romero's room. She did not knock.

She simply opened the door, went in, and closed it behind her.

I stood in front of the door of Mike'sroom and knocked. There was no answer.

I tried the knob and it opened.

Inside the room was in great disorder.

All the bags were opened and clothing was strewn around.

He opened his eyes and looked at me.

"Hello, Jake," he said very slowly.

"I'm getting a little sleep. I've want ed a little sleep for a long time."

"Let me cover you over." "No. I'm quite warm."

"Don't go. I haven't got the sleep yet."

"You'll sleep, Mike. Don't worry, boy."

"Brett's got a bull-fighter," Mike said."But her Jew has gone away."

He turned his head and looked at me. "Damned good thing, what?"

"Yes. Now go to sleep, Mike. You ought to get some sleep."

"I'm just starting. I'm going to get a littie sleep."

He shut his eyes. I went out of the room and turned the door quietly.

Bill was in my room reading the paper.

"See Mike?" "Yes." "Let's go and eat."

"I won't eat down-stairs with that German head waiter.

He was damned snotty when I was getting Mike up-stairs."

"He was snotty to us, too." "Let's goout and eat in the town."

We went down the stairs. On the stairs we passed a girl coming up with a covered tray.

"There goes Brett's lunch," Bill said. "And the kid's," I said.

Outside on the terrace under the arcade the German head waiter came up.

His red cheeks were shiny. He was being polite.

"I haff a tabul for two for you gentlemen," he said.

"Go sit at it," Bill said. We went on out across the street.

### 背景知识

**💧****教堂的各种英文名称**

Brett和Jake在散步的途中经过莱圣福明礼拜堂（"Is that San Fermin's?" Brett looked at the yellow wall of the chapel.）并看到了许多人在教堂里做祷告（Many people were praying. ）

这里出现的教堂用的是chapel这个单词，在西方国家，表示教堂的单词有很多，我们今天来一起了解一下它们之间的差异吧！



\1. Church

church我们最熟知的词，广义所说的“教堂”，可以看作是所有宗教活动（如弥撒Mass）发生场所的统称。而事实上，church更适合被翻译成教会，不仅仅单指一座建筑，而是堂区所在了。



\2. Cathedral

我们常常把Cathedral翻译成“大教堂”，难道大一点的教堂就叫Cathedral么？答案是否定的，其实Cathedral的正确翻译是“主教座堂”。它的原意是指“主教的座位”，是一个教区里主教（Bishop）所在的地儿。它们大多都拥有极其精美和古老的内饰，华丽的内部结构，以及令人惊叹的彩绘玻璃。



\3. Abbey

很多人知道这个词是从两个地方，一个是伦敦最主要的宗教活动建筑西敏寺（Westminster Abbey），另一个是英剧《唐顿庄园》（*Downton Abbey*）. Abbey的意思是“修道院”、“寺”，通常规模不小，一般包括好几座教堂、神学院、隐修会和图书馆等等，院长就跟校长差不多，在修道院中掌管很大的权力。



\4. Basilica

这个词不是很常见，但是在宗教建筑上具有很重要的地位。如果你对建筑略有研究，那么你可能听说过，这是一个形容古罗马建筑形式的词。随着时间推移，它也用来赋予有特殊地位的教堂，中文的正式名称为“宗座圣殿”。



\5. Chapel

一般指规模和结构比较小的教堂，在中文中的正式翻译是“小教堂”。可以为独立建筑，也可以附属某个机构（比如大学、医院），为其提供宗教服务。当然也有非常显赫的Chapel，比如西斯庭教堂（Sistine Chapel），因米开朗基罗绘制的著名壁画“创世纪”和“最后的审判”，重要地位不言而喻。

很多新人喜欢的教堂婚礼热门举行地都是Chapel. 例如冲绳的白色教堂Aqualuce Chapel、巴厘岛的悬崖教堂Ritual Chapel、美国的木质教堂Mildred B. Cooper Memorial Chapel.

### 课文理解

到了狂欢节的最后一天，认清自己无法得到Brett这个事实后，Cohn下定决心离开潘普洛纳（"Is Cohn gone?" Brett asked. "Yes," Bill said. "He hired a car."）并且直到本书末尾他都不会再现身。Brett和Romero这一对“有情人”似乎也终于可以相守在一起，Brett在和Jake独处的时候语气里是显而易见的喜悦——

💧**Clue 1**: Brett enjoys much in her relationship with Romero.

**Evidence 1**: Brett was radiant. She was happy. The sun was out and the day was bright.

"I feel altogether changed," Brett said. "You've no idea, Jake."

勃莱特满面春风。她很高兴。太阳出来了，天色亮堂堂的。

“我觉得自己完全变了。”勃莱特说。“你想象不到，杰克。”



**Evidence 2**: "You know," Brett said, "I'm not worried about him at all. I just feel happy about him."

“你知道，”勃莱特又说，“我一点都不为他担心。我只是为他感到幸福。”

回到旅馆后，Jake目送着Brett走到Romero的房间门口，Brett没有敲门就直接进去了（She did not knock. She simply opened the door, went in, and closed it behind her）, 足见俩人已经十分亲密。接着他按照Brett的嘱托来到Mike的房间，里面的场景十分不堪，Mike仍然在巨大的绝望和崩溃中——



💧**Clue 2**: Mike is in immense despair.

**Evidence 1**: Inside the room was in great disorder. All the bags were opened and clothing was strewn around. There were empty bottles beside the bed.

房间里一团糟。所有的提包都开着， 衣服扔得到处都是。床边有几个空酒瓶。

**Evidence 2**: He opened his eyes and looked at me.

"Hello, Jake," he said very slowly. "I'm getting a little sleep. I've wanted a little sleep for a long time."

他张开眼睛看我。“你好，杰克。”他慢条斯理地说。“我想打个盹儿。好长时间了，我总想打个盹儿。”



Mike不止一次提到，Brett其实陆陆续续地有过不少情人，现在她只不过是把Cohn这个拳击手给抛弃而搭上了斗牛士Romero罢了（"Brett's got a bull-fighter," Mike said. "But her Jew has gone away."）



那么Mike清醒过来之后会如何抉择呢？在不受Romero的同乡们待见的情况下（"They're very angry about me, he says."） Brett又是否会和Romero顺利继续在一起？

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****Duel in Western Countries**

**西方的决斗文化**



昨天我们提到的Cohn去找Brett的时候，和Romero干了一架（还有好几个回合）。其实在西方国家的历史和文学作品中，决斗时常出现（不仅包括这种为心爱的女人而战的情况）。今天我们就来一起了解一下决斗~

在莎士比亚（William Shakespeare）的哈姆雷特（*Hamlet*）中，克劳狄斯教唆奥菲利亚的哥哥和哈姆雷特决斗，两人的决斗不分彼此，最后一起中剑身亡。这样的场景屡见不鲜，欧洲的贵族为了荣誉、爱情、军功、解决司法纠纷等任何理由都会进行决斗。

欧洲贵族的决斗传统来自日耳曼人的尚武文化。如果再远一些，可以追溯到古希腊的武装斗争解决纠纷的文化传统。在荷马史诗（Homer's Epic）《伊利亚特》（*Iliad*）中也有这样的情节：两个男人为证明自己是美女海伦的主人而在宙斯面前进行决斗，输掉的一方就是撒谎者，发动了著名的特洛伊战争（Trojan War）. 

到了中世纪的时候，司法决斗被西欧各国广泛采用。例如，一个人在法官面前控告另一个人犯了某种罪行，而对方坚决不承认，此时法官就会让两人决斗，谁在决斗中获胜就能赢得官司（lawsuit）. 而输的一方就算侥幸不死，也要受到法律的制裁（sanction）.

（欧洲决斗场所）

中世纪之后，欧洲各国的贵族男子都身佩长剑，随时准备与别人拼个你死我活——无论理由是多么微小或荒谬。因为在他们看来，决斗本身就是富有骑士精神和男子气概（masculinity）的象征。在中世纪骑士的小说里，我们经常能看到某位骑士发誓（swear）为心爱的贵夫人效劳的情节，这里的“效劳”便意味着：如果有人敢冒犯您，我将立刻和他决斗，不死不休！

我们都知道著名的俄国诗人普希金（Pushkin）, 他逝世时年仅37岁，而他是死于一场决斗。起因是他被誉为“圣彼得堡的天鹅”的妻子娜塔丽娅，一名宪兵队长乔丹特斯疯狂爱上他的夫人，写匿名信笑普希金是乌龟，他忍无可忍，为了名誉，他与丹特斯进行决斗不幸中枪而死。当时的报纸刊载：“俄罗斯诗歌的太阳殒落了”。

## Chapter 18.2

We ate at a restaurant in a side street off the square.

They were all men eating in the restaurant.

It was full of smoke and drinking and singing.

The food was good and so was the wine.

We did not talk much. Afterward we went to the café and watched the fiesta come to the boiling-point.

> <font color=red>Afterward we went to the café and watched the fiesta come to the boiling-point.</font>

Brett came over soon after lunch. She said she had looked in the room and that Mike was asleep.

When the fiesta boiled over and toward the bull-ring we went with the crowd.

Brett sat at the ringside between Bill and me.

Directly below us was the callejon ([西]小巷，过道), the passageway between the stands and the red fence of the barrera ([西]栅栏).

Behind us the concrete stands filled solidly.

Out in front, beyond the red fence, the sand of the ring was smooth-rolled and yellow.

It looked a little heavy from the rain,but it was dry in the sun and firm and smooth.

The swordhandlers and bull-ring servants came down the callejon carrying on their shoulders the wicker baskets of fighting capes and muletas ([西]红布).

They were bloodstained and compactly folded and packed in the baskets.

> ==bloodstained英 ['blʌdsteɪnd] 美 [ˈblʌdˌstend] adj. 血污的，犯杀人罪的==

>
> 还可以形容人或者动物“矮小而健壮的” 例如：He had a compact and muscular body.

The sword-handlers opened the heavy leather sword-cases so the red wrapped hilts of the sheaf of swords showed as the leather case leaned against the fence.

They unfolded the dark-stained red flannel of the muletas and fixed batons in them to spread the stuff and give the matador something to hold.

Brett watched it all. She was absorbed in the professional details.

"He's his name stencilled on all the capes and muletas," she said. "Why do they call them muletas?"

"I don't know." "I wonder if they ever launder them."

> ==launder英 [ˈlɔ:ndə(r)] 美 [ˈlɔndɚ,ˈlɑn-] vt. 洗涤；洗黑钱（把来路可疑的钱弄得貌似合法）；洗烫衣物；消除…的污点 vi. 洗涤；洗熨 n.[矿]槽洗机，流槽==

"I don't think so. It might spoil the color."

"The blood must stiffen them," Bill said.

"Funny," Brett said. "How one doesn't mind the blood."

Below in the narrow passage of the callejon the sword-handlers arranged everything.

All the seats were full. Above, all the boxes were full.

There was not an empty seat except in the President's box.

When he came in the fight would start.

Across the smooth sand, in the highdoorway that led into the corrals, the bull-fighters were standing, their arms furled in their capes, talking, waiting for the signal to march in across the arena. Brett was watching them with the glasses.

"Here, would you like to look?"

I looked through the glasses and saw the three matadors.

Romero was in the centre, Belmonte on his left, Marcial on his right.

Back of them were their people, and behind the banderilleros, back in the passageway and in the open space of the corral, I saw the picadors.

Romero was wearing a black suit. His tricornered hat was low down over his eyes.

I could not see his face clearly under the hat, but it looked badly marked.

> <font color=red>I could not see his face clearly under the hat, but it looked badly marked.</font>
>
> 我看不清他帽子下面的脸，但是看来伤痕不少。
>
> **💧表达精讲**

> badly marked 形容Romero的脸被Cohn揍得“伤痕累累”；mark有“留下痕迹，弄污”（to damage sth or spoil its appearance）的意思，和mar类似，比如：The disease had marked/marred her face for life.（这场疾病在她脸上留下了终身的疤痕。） 

He was looking straight ahead.

Marcial was smoking a cigarette guardedly, holding it in his hand.

Belmonte looked ahead, his face wan and yellow, his long wolf jaw out.

He was looking at nothing.

Neither he nor Romero seemed to have anything in common with the others. They were all alone.

The President came in; there was hand clapping above us in the grand stand, and I handed the glasses to Brett.

There was applause. The music started. Brett looked through the glasses.

"Here, take them," she said.

Through the glasses I saw Belmonte speak to Romero.

Marcial straightened up and dropped his cigarette, and, looking straight ahead, their heads back, their free arms swinging, the three matadors walked out.

Behind them came all the procession, opening out, all striding in step, all the capes furled, everybody with free arms swinging, and behind rode the picadors, their pics rising like lances.

Behind all came the two trains of mules and the bull-ring servants.

The matadors bowed, holding their hats on, before the President's box, and then came over to the barrera below us.

Pedro Romero took off his heavy gold-brocaded cape and handed it over the fence to his sword-handler.

He said something to the sword-handler.

Close below us we saw Romero's lips were puffed, both eyes were discolored.

His face was discolored and swollen.

The sword-handler took the cape, looked up at Brett, and came over to us and handed up the cape.

"Spread it out in front of you," I said.

Brett leaned forward. The cape was heavy and smoothly stiff with gold.

The sword-handler looked back, shook his head, and said something.

A man beside me leaned over toward Brett.

"He doesn't want you to spread it," he said.

"You should fold it and keep it in your lap."

Brett folded the heavy cape.

Romero did not look up at us. He was speaking to Belmonte.

Belmonte had sent his formal cape over to some friends.

He looked across at them and smiled, his wolf smile that was only with the mouth.

Romero leaned over the barrera and asked for the water-jug.

The sword-handler brought it and Romero poured water over the percale of his fighting-cape, and then scuffed the lower folds in the sand with his slippered foot.

"What's that for?" Brett asked.

"To give it weight in the wind."

"His face looks bad," Bill said.

"He feels very badly," Brett said. "He should be in bed."

The first bull was Belmonte's. Belmonte was very good.

But because he got thirty thousand pesetas and people had stayed in line all night to buy tickets to see him, the crowd demanded that he should be more than very good.

Belmonte's great attraction is working close to the bull.

In bull-fighting they speak of the terrain of the bull and the terrain of the bull-fighter.

> ==terrain英 [təˈreɪn] 美 [təˈren] n. 地形，地势；地面，地带；[地理]岩层；（知识的）领域范围==
>
> n. 地带（a particular type of land）

>
> 💧terrain 还有“地形、地势”的意思，例如：He knows the terrain of this locality like the back of his hand. 
>
> 他对这一带的地形了如指掌。

As long as a bull-fighter stays in his own terrain he is comparatively safe.

Each time he enters into the terrain of the bull he is in great danger.

Belmonte, in his best days, worked always in the terrain of the bull.

This way he gave the sensation of coming tragedy.

People went to the corrida to see Belmonte, to be given tragic sensations, and perhaps to see the death of Belmonte.

Fifteen years ago they said if you wanted to see Belmonte you should go quickly, while he was still alive.

Since then he has killed more than a thousand bulls.

When he retired the legend grew up about how his bull-fighting had been, and when he came out of retirement the public were disappointed because no real man could work as close to the bulls as Belmonte was supposed to have done, not, of course, even Belmonte.

Also Belmonte imposed conditions and insisted that his bulls should not be too large, nor too dangerously armed with horns, and so the element that was necessary to give the sensation of tragedy was not there,

and the public, who wanted three times as much from Belmonte, who was sick with a fistula, as Belmonte had ever been able to give, felt defrauded and cheated,

and Belmonte's jaw came further out in contempt, and his face turned yellower, and he moved with greater difficulty as his pain increased,

and finally the crowd were actively against him, and he was utterly contemptuous and indifferent.

His jaw only went further out.

Sometimes he turned to smile that toothed, longjawed, lipless smile when he was called something particularly insulting.

And always the pain that any movement produced grew stronger and stronger, until finally his yellow face was parchment color.

And after his second bull was dead and the throwing of bread and cushions was over, after he had saluted the President with the same wolf-jawed smile and contemptuous eyes, and handed his sword over the barrera to be wiped, and put back in its case, he passed through into the callejon and leaned on the barrera below us.

When he looked up, finally, he asked for a drink of water.

He swallowed a little, rinsed his mouth, spat the water, took his cape, and went back into the ring.

Because they were against Belmonte the public were for Romero.

From the moment he left the barrera and went toward the bull they applauded him.

Belmonte watched Romero, too, watched him always without seeming to.

He paid no attention to Marcial.

Marcial was the sort of thing he knew all about.

He had come out of retirement to compete with Marcial, knowing it was a competition gained in advance.

His return from retirement had been spoiled by Romero.

Romero did always, smoothly, calmly, and beautifully, what he, Belmonte, could only bring himself to do now sometimes.

The crowd felt it, even the people from Biarritz, even the American ambassador saw it, finally.

### 背景知识

**💧****1. Historical Prototype of the Three Bullfighters**

**本书斗牛士的历史原型**

我们今天的内容中出现了三名斗牛士，他们的名字都是有历史原型的。（I looked through the glasses and saw the three matadors. Romero was in the centre, Belmonte on his left, Marcial on his right. 我从望远镜里看出去，看到那三位斗牛士。罗梅罗居中，左边是贝尔蒙蒂，右边是马西亚尔。）

斗牛博物馆中的Petro Romero 画像和雕像 



Belmonte和Marcial都是真实的历史人物。Belmonte（1892-1962）是和Joselito（何塞·利托）齐名的斗牛士，Joselito在我们前面的情节中也出现过：Jake跟Brett提到，在Joselito惨死斗牛场之后，大家就开始玩那一套唬人的把戏（I told her how since the death of Joselito all the bull-fighters had been developing a technique that simulated this appearance of danger...）

Belmonte革新了斗牛风格，为现代斗牛流派的开创人。他曾于1922年一度退出斗牛界，1925年东山再起，技艺大不如前。

Romero的原型则是Cayetano Ordóñez（卡耶塔诺·奥多涅斯），1925年他以78场斗牛和1927年的65场斗牛成为斗牛界的领导者。他的第三个儿子Antonio Ordóñez（安东尼奥·奥多涅斯）和海明威也是好友（比如海明威的作品《午后之死》、《危险的夏天》都有许多灵感是来自于Antonio）. 而Pedro Romero这个名字则来自于18世纪的一位斗牛士，他从1771年到1799年隐退为止，共杀死五千六百头公牛，平均每年达两百头之多。

**2. The Town of Bullfight：Ronda**

**海明威钟爱的斗牛小镇：龙达**

龙达盘踞在仞立陡峭的悬崖（cliff）之上，远远望去，白色的房屋犹如生长在悬崖之上，有人说“这座小城安宁、质朴，仿佛是从周围的山崖之中自然而然生长出来的”。

海明威一生钟爱这个小镇，在《死在午后》（*Death in the Afternoon*）中，他写道: 

With the romantic background and the modern comfort, if a honeymoon or elopement is not a success in Ronda it would be as well to start for Paris and both commence making your own friends.

“如果你想要去西班牙度蜜月或跟人私奔的话，龙达是最合适的地方，整个小镇目之所及都是浪漫的风景……如果在龙达度蜜月或私奔都没有成功的话，那最好去巴黎，分道扬镳、另觅新欢好了。”

海明威一生多次探访龙达小镇，他的多部作品都以龙达为背景。除了《死在午后》， 描写西班牙内战的《丧钟为谁而鸣》（*For Whom the Bell Tolls*）， 也取材于此。 

龙达因斗牛而著名，曾出现过两个斗牛世家，一个是Romero家族，另一个是Ordonez家族。

龙达斗牛场是西班牙最古老的斗牛场之一。斗牛场四周是双层看台，能容纳5000名观众。第一个在此出场的是西班牙斗牛史上的重要人物Pedro Romero。每年九月的第一个周末，在Ronda，都会有著名的戈雅斗牛节（Corridas Goyescas），整个斗牛的过程以及服装，都是按照著名画家戈雅的画作呈现。

### 课文理解

今天的内容描写了狂欢节上的最后一场斗牛赛，参加的斗牛士们都是非同小可的大人物（同时都有历史上的原型；这场比赛也基本是以1925年的那场著名斗牛赛为参考）。在比赛开始之前，斗牛用的斗篷和红布都被放在一个柳条篮里，并且上面沾满了之前留下来的血迹，Jake和Brett对此展开了一番讨论，暗示了斗牛比赛的血腥——



💧**Clue 1**: Bull-fighting is bloody.



**Evidence 1**: The swordhandlers and bull-ring servants came down the callejon carrying on their shoulders the wicker baskets of fighting capes and muletas. They were bloodstained and compactly folded and packed in the baskets.

随从和斗牛场的工役走下通道，肩上扛着装有斗牛用的斗篷和红巾的柳条篮。沾有血迹的斗篷和红巾叠得板板整整地放在柳条篮里。

勃莱特满面春风。她很高兴。太阳出来了，天色亮堂堂的。

“我觉得自己完全变了。”勃莱特说。“你想象不到，杰克。”



**Evidence 2**: "I wonder if they ever launder them."

"I don't think so. It might spoil the color."

"The blood must stiffen them," Bill said.

"Funny," Brett said. "How one doesn't mind the blood."

“不知道这些东西到底有没有洗过。”

“我看是从来不洗的。一洗可能要掉色。”

“血迹会使法兰绒发硬。”比尔说。

“真奇怪，”勃莱特说。“人们竟然对血迹一点都不在意。”



对于斗牛比赛的残忍和血腥在前面的内容已有铺垫，比如有观众在斗牛赛场外被公牛攻击挑死，之后这头公牛被Romero在赛场上刺死，割下来的牛耳还作为荣耀的象征送给了Brett.



今天出场的人物当中，作者花了相当的笔墨描写Belmonte. 这个人物曾经风光无限，但是后来因为疾病而隐退，现在又要重出江湖。但没想到Romero作为新起之秀完全抢了他的风头——



💧**Clue 2**:  Romero is a great rival of Belmonte.



**Evidence 1**: Because they were against Belmonte the public were for Romero. From the moment he left the barrera and went toward the bull they applauded him. Belmonte watched Romero, too, watched him always without seeming to.

观众因为反对贝尔蒙蒂，所以就向着罗梅罗。罗梅罗一离开看台前的栅栏向牛走去，观众就向他鼓起掌来。贝尔蒙蒂也在看他，装作不看，其实一直在看。



**Evidence 2**: His return from retirement had been spoiled by Romero. Romero did always, smoothly, calmly, and beautifully, what he, Belmonte, could only bring himself to do now sometimes.

他这次隐退后重返斗牛场被罗梅罗破坏了。罗梅罗总是那么自如、稳健、优美。他，贝尔蒙蒂，如今只偶尔才能使自己做到这一点。



这个细节也从侧面反映了Romero的确是一位天才型的斗牛士，并且由于年轻更加前途无量，观众们也对他喜爱非常。这里呼应了Jake先前对Romero的评价：This was a real one. There had not been a real one for a long time. 以致于Belmonte这样的辉煌人物在他面前都要黯然失色。

It was a competition that Belmonte would not enter because it would lead only to a bad horn wound or death.

Belmonte was no longer well enough.

He no longer had his greatest moments in the bull-ring.

He was not sure that there were any great moments.

Things were not the same and now life only came in flashes.

> ③getting on...leaning on...looking over... 这一串非谓语动词作为he的伴随主语，补充说明Belmonte当时在挑选公牛的情形。

So he had two small, manageable bulls without much horns, and when he felt the greatness again coming, just a little of it through the pain that was always with him, it had been discounted and sold in advance, and it did not give him a good feeling.

It was the greatness, but it did not make bull-fighting wonderful to him any more.

Pedro Romero had the greatness.

He loved bull-fighting, and I think he loved the bulls, and I think he loved Brett.

Everything of which he could control the locality he did in front of her all that afternoon.

Never once did he look up. He made it stronger that way, and did it for himself, too, as well as for her.

Because he did not look up to ask ifit pleased he did it all for himself inside, and it strengthened him, and yet he did it for her, too.

But he did not do it for her at any loss to himself.

He gained by it all through the afternoon.

His first "quite" was directly below us.

The three matadors take the bull in turn after each charge he makes at a picador.

Belmonte was the first. Marcial was the second. Then came Romero.

The three of them were standing at the left of the horse.

The picador, his hat down over his eyes, the shaft of his pic angling sharply toward the bull, kicked in the spurs and held them and with the reins in his left hand walked the horse forward toward the bull.

The bull was watching.

Seemingly he watched the white horse, but really he watched the triangular steel point of the pic.

Romero, watching, saw the bull start to turn his head. He did not want to charge.

Romero flicked his cape so the color caught the bull's eye.

The bull charged with the reflex, charged, and found not the flash of color but a white horse.

And a man leaned far over the horse, shot the steel point of the long hickory shaft into the hump of muscle on the bull's shoulder, and pulled his horse sideways as he pivoted on the pic, making a wound,enforcing the iron into the bull's shoulder, making him bleed for Belmonte.

The bull did not insist under the iron.

He did not really want to get at the horse.

He turned and the group broke apart and Romero was taking him out with his cape.

He took him out softly and smoothly, and then stopped and, standing squarely in front of the bull, offered him the cape.

The bull's tail went up and he charged, and Romero moved his arms ahead of the bull, wheeling, his feet firmed.

The dampened, mud-weighted cape swung open and full as a sail fills, and Romero pivoted with it just ahead of the bull.

At the end of the pass they were facing each other again.

Romero smiled. The bull wanted it again, and Romero's cape filled again, this time on the other side.

Each time he let the bull pass so close that the man and the bull and the cape that filled and pivoted ahead of the bull were all one sharply etched mass.

It was all so slow and so controlled.

It was as though he were rocking the bull to sleep.

He made four veronicas like that, and finished with a half-veronica that turned his back on the bull and came away toward the applause, his hand on his hip, his cape on his arm, and the bull watching his back going away.

In his own bulls he was perfect. His first bull did not see well.

After the first two passes with the cape Romero knew exactly how bad the vision was impaired.

> ==impair英 [ɪmˈpeə(r)] 美 [ɪmˈper] vt. 损害，削弱==

He worked accordingly. It was not brilliant bull-fighting.

It was only perfect bull-fighting. The crowd wanted the bull changed.

They made a great row. Nothing very fine could happen with a bull that could not see the lures, but the President would not order him replaced.

"Why don't they change him?" Brett asked.

"They've paid for him. They don't want to lose their money."

"It's hardly fair to Romero."

"Watch how he handles a bull that can't see the color."

"It's the sort of thing I don't like to see."

It was not nice to watch if you cared anything about the person who was doing it.

With the bull who could not see the colors of the capes, or the scarlet flannel of the muleta, Romero had to make the bull consent with his body.

He had to get so close that the bull saw his body, and would start for it, and then shift the bull's charge to the flannel and finish out the pass in the classic manner.

The Biarritz crowd did not like it.

They thought Romero was afraid, and that was why he gave that little sidestep each time as he transferred the bull's charge from his own body to the flannel.

They preferred Belmonte's imitation of himself or Marcial's imitation of Belmonte.

There were three of them in the row behind us.

"What's he afraid of the bull for? The bull's so dumb he only goes after the cloth."

"He's just a young bull-fighter. He hasn't learned it yet."

"But I thought he was fine with the cape before."

"Probably he's nervous now."

Out in the centre of the ring, all alone, Romero was going on with the same thing, getting so close that the bull could see him plainly, offering the body, offering it again a little closer.

The bull watching dully, then so close that the bull thought he had him, offering again and finally drawing the charge and then, just before the horns came, giving the bull the red cloth to follow with that little, almost imperceptible（几乎察觉不到的）, jerk that so offended the critical judgment of the Biarritz bull-fight experts.

The bull charged as Romero charged.

Romero's left hand dropped the muleta over the bull's muzzle to blind him.

His left shoulder went forward between the horns as the sword went in, and for just an instant he and the bull were one.

Romero way out over the bull, the right arm extended high up to where the hilt of the sword had gone in between the bull's shoulders.

> <font color=red> ...Romero way out over the bull, the right arm extended high up to where the hilt of the sword had gone in between the bull's shoulders.</font>

Then the figure was broken.

There was a little jolt as Romero came clear, and then he was standing, one hand up, facing the bull.

His shirt ripped out from under his sleeve, the white blowing in the wind, and the bull, the red sword hilttight between his shoulders, his head going down and his legs settling.

"There he goes," Bill said.

Romero was close enough so the bull could see him.

His hand still up, he spoke to the bull.

The bull gathered himself, then his head went forward and he went over slowly, then all over, suddenly, four feet in the air.

They handed the sword to Romero, and carrying it blade down, the muleta in his other hand, he walked over to in front of the President's box, bowed, straightened, and cameover to the barrera and handed overthe sword and muleta.

"Bad one," said the sword-handler.

"He made me sweat," said Romero.

He wiped off his face. The sword-handler handed him the water-jug.

Romero wiped his lips. It hurt him todrink out of the jug. He did not look up at us.

Marcial had a big day.

They were still applauding him whenRomero's last bull came in.

It was the bull that had sprinted out and killed the man in the morning running.

During Romero's first bull his hurt face had been very noticeable.

Everything he did showed it.

All the concentration of the awkwardly delicate working with the bull that could not see well brought it out.

The fight with Cohn had not touched his spirit but his face had been smashed and his body hurt.

Each thing that he did with this bull wiped that out a little cleaner.

It was a good bull, a big bull, and with horns, and it turned and recharged easily and surely.

He was what Romero wanted in bulls.

### 背景知识

**💧****斗牛比赛中的术语**

作为斗牛迷的海明威在刻画斗牛的过程时几乎是极尽其祥，对于很多的术语（或者说是只有斗牛迷“aficionado”才能看懂的技艺）也是信手拈来。所以今天的背景为大家准备了内容里出现的和斗牛相关的名词来帮助理解哦~

\1. Picador

在读原文的时候，很容易混淆的是picador和matador. matador是主斗牛士，比如Belmonte, Romero和Marcial. 而picador则是指“长矛手”（一般是骑在马上然后用长矛刺公牛。这个词来源于西班牙语里的一个动词pricar (来源于拉丁文里的piccare), 相当于英文里的“prick”，表示“刺，戳”。所以长矛手拿的长矛也就是pic啦~

长矛手一般在斗牛比赛的第一阶段上场，负责刺扎公牛的背颈部，使其血管刺破，进行放血，这样可以为斗牛士打开一个下剑的通道。比如今天文章里描述道：

...and a man leaned far over the horse, shot the steel point of the long hickory shaft into the hump of muscle on the bull's shoulder,and pulled his horse sideways as he pivoted on the pic, making a wound, enforcing the iron into the bull's shoulder, making him bleed for Belmonte.

（还有一个人从马背上深深地向前哈腰，把山胡桃木长矛的钢尖扎进公牛肩部的肉峰，然后以长矛为枢轴，把马朝一旁赶，割开一处伤口，把钢尖深深扎入牛的肩部，使它流血，为贝尔蒙蒂再上场做准备。）



\2. quite

我们先来看这个词在文章中出现的位置：

His first "quite" was directly below us. The three matadors take the bull in turn after each charge he makes at a picador. Belmonte was the first. Marcial was the second. Then came Romero. 

（他第一次出场把公牛引开的表演就在我们座位的下面。公牛每向骑马长矛手发动一次冲击后，三位斗牛士就轮番上去对付公牛。贝尔蒙蒂排在第一位。马西亚尔第二位。最后轮到罗梅罗。）

这里的his是指Romero. 而quite这个词，根据海明威在他两部斗牛专书《死在午后》和《危险的夏天》中自己的解释，是由“quitar”派生而来，意为“调离，引走”。也就是把公牛从任何受到他直接威胁的人旁边引开。尤指公牛向长矛手进攻后，手拿红斗篷的斗牛士轮番上阵，将公牛从长矛手和马身边引走（The three matadors take the bull in turn after each charge he makes at a picador）.



3.veronica (pass)

veronica和pass是一个意思，指斗牛士静止不动，将斗篷张开，慢慢地引牛擦身而过的一套动作（to slowly swing the cape away from the charging bull while keeping his feet in the same position）. 我们来看看原文里的描述：

He made four veronicas like that, and finished with a half-veronica that turned his back on the bull and came away toward the applause...

（他把这套动作做了四遍，最后加上一遍，只做了一半，背朝着牛向鼓掌的方向走去，一只手按在臀部，胳膊上挎着斗篷，公牛瞅着他渐去的背影。）



He had to get so close that the bull saw his body, and would start for it, and then shift the bull's charge to the flannel and finish out thepass in the classic manner.

（他不得不靠得那么近，使牛看清他的身躯，向他扑来。然后他把牛的攻击目标引向那块法兰绒巾，以传统的方式结束这一回合。）



这里强调Romero是以“传统”的方式来结束这一回合（pass）是因为Romero对付的这只公牛视力损伤得很厉害，所以他不能向惯常一样用红斗篷来引逗公牛，而是通过自己的身子贴近公牛，最后再及时躲开，把公牛的注意力转移到斗篷上。



\4. muleta / cape

在斗牛场上会出现两种斗篷（cape），第一种是斗牛士上场的时候披在身上的斗篷，比如昨天的内容里提到Romero上场前先把身上的斗篷脱下来（Pedro Romero took off his heavy gold-brocaded cape and handed it over the fence to his sword-handler）. 另一种其实就是指斗牛士用来引逗公牛的斗篷。这里的cape和muleta的不同之处在于，cape一面是品红色（magenta），一面是黄色或蓝色，而muleta则是两面都是红色。

在使用区别上，cape一般用在前面，而有的斗牛士会在最后的阶段把cape换成muleta. 这两个词今天的内容里也同时出现了：

With the bull who could not see the colors of the capes, or the scarlet flannel of the muleta, Romero had to make the bull consent with his body.

（碰上这头既看不清斗篷的颜色，又看不到那块猩红法兰绒巾的公牛，罗梅罗只好以自己的身体同它保持协调。）

### 课文理解

昨天的内容里，三位斗牛士中Belmonte第一个上场，虽然他曾经辉煌一时，但这次复出明显风光不再。而他也因为身体状况不佳，同时刻意在比赛前挑选了较为温顺的公牛（So he had two small, manageable bulls without much horns）, 导致表演的刺激性和观赏性都大打折扣。他自己也失去了全力投身斗牛的那种热情，心里装满苦水，表面上又是一副满不在乎的样子——



💧**Clue 1**: Belmonte becomes bitter and indifferent in the ring.



**Evidence 1**: Belmonte was no longer well enough. He no longer had his greatest moments in the bull-ring. He was not sure that there were any great moments.

贝尔蒙蒂已经体力不支了。他在斗牛场显赫一时的高潮已经过去。他觉得这种高潮大概不会再有了。



**Evidence 2:** It was the greatness, but it did not make bull-fighting wonderful to him any more.

这的确是当年的那种风采，但是再也不能使他在斗牛中得到乐趣了。



这种对于生活失去热情的无力感正好也是其他角色们作为“迷惘的一代”的典型特征，从激烈高昂的战争生活中退下来后，他们要同时面对生活的枯燥无趣和在战斗中遗留下来的身体和心理伤害，这种落差造成了他们只能逃避麻醉，虚无度日。但Romero则完全是对立面的存在，他对斗牛有着炽烈而纯粹的热。尤其在今天的内容里，我们看到了他勇敢、自信、坚定的一面——



💧**Clue 2**:  Romero is all brave, confident and determined.



**Evidence 1**: Because he did not look up to ask if it pleased he did it all for himself inside, and it strengthened him, and yet he did it for her, too. But he did not do it for her at any loss to himself. He gained by it all through the afternoon.

因为他没有抬头用目光探询对方是否满意，所以一门心思地为自己而表演，这给了他力量，然而他这样做也是为了她。但是并没有为了她而有损于自己。那天整个下午他因此而占了上风。



**Evidence 2**: It was a good bull, a big bull, and with horns, and it turned and recharged easily and surely. He was what Romero wanted in bulls.

这是一头好牛，一头身躯庞大的牛，犄角锐利，不论转身还是袭击都很灵活、很准确。它正是罗梅罗向往的那种牛。



Romero先是特意在Brett面前表演自己的高超技艺，其专注也丝毫没有因为顾及取悦Brett而减弱，这里也暗示了在他和Brett的关系中，他似乎能够完美地进行“掌控”。在接下来的比赛中，尽管Romero遇上了一头视力很不好的公牛，他也毫不慌张，而是采取了贴身肉搏的方式来引逗公牛的注意力，随后再迅速抽身而退，转而用红布来控制。



在对公牛的选择和喜好上，Romero也和Belmonte截然不同。Belmonte偏好的是个头小、并且易于掌控的公牛（small and manageable）, 而Romero则喜欢庞大并且行动灵活的，这种牛可以激起他的征服欲，并且他也有足够的胆量和信心与之相斗。



另外这头牛正好就是将一个无辜男子至于死命的那个罪魁祸首（It was the bull that had sprinted out and killed the man in the morning running）, Jake在前文已经透露这头牛由Romero所刺死，割下来的牛耳还送给了Brett. 在明天的内容里我们会再看到这场斗争的具体细节。

When he had finished his work with the muleta and was ready to kill, the crowd made him go on.

They did not want the bull killed yet,they did not want it to be over.

Romero went on. It was like a course in bull-fighting.

The crowd did not want it ever to be finished.

The bull was squared on all four feet to be killed, and Romero killed directly below us.

He killed not as he had been forced to by the last bull, but as he wanted to.

The bull watched him. Romero spoke to the bull and tapped one of his feet.

The bull charged and Romero waited for the charge, the muleta held low, sighting along the blade, his feet firm.

Then without taking a step forward, he became one with the bull, the sword was in high between the shoulders.

The bull had followed the low-swung flannel, that disappeared as Romerolurched clear to the left, and it was over.

>
> 这里需要联系上下文来理解：首先Romero拔剑出鞘（He profiled directly in front of the bull, drew the sword out of the folds of the muleta and sighted along the blade）; 接着Romero等着公牛主动扑上来，目光顺着剑锋瞄准，依然稳稳地站着（The bull charged and Romero waited for the charge, the muleta held low, sighting along the blade, his feet firm）; 然后转瞬之间（这句话里的“Then”是一个转折），Romero就和公牛合为一体了（he became one with the bull）;
>
> 再看下文，Romero没有再做其他动作，公牛就已经开始摇晃并且很快跪倒在地（he swung from side to side, hesitated, then went down on his knees）. 这样就可以推断出the sword was in high betwen the shoulders其实是指短剑已经插入牛的两肩之间了。
>
> ②the low-swung flannel “低处舞动的法兰绒巾”，swung是swing的过去分词形式，swing有“摇摆，摇荡”的意思；
>
> ③as Romero lurched clear to the left “随着罗梅罗干净利落地猛地朝左边一撤步”；lurch指“猛地一动”；clear作副词表示“避开，躲开”，常见搭配有：keep/stay/steer clear (of sb/sth), 比如：If you’re a beginner, steer clear of resorts with reputations for difficult skiing.（如果你是初学者，那就不要去以滑雪难度高而闻名的度假胜地。） 所以lurch clear也就是“猛地避开”。

The bull tried to go forward, his legs commenced to settle, he swung from side to side, hesitated, then went down on his knees, and Romero's older brother leaned forward behind him and drove a short knife into the bull's neck at the base of the horns.

The first time he missed. He drove the knife in again, and the bull wentover, twitching and rigid.

Romero's brother, holding the bull's horn in one hand, the knife in the other, looked up at the President's box.

Handkerchiefs were waving all over the bullring.

The President looked down from thebox and waved his handkerchief.

The brother cut the notched black ear from the dead bull and trotted over with it to Romero.

The bull lay heavy and black on the sand, his tongue out.

Boys were running toward him from all parts of the arena, making a little circle around him.

They were starting to dance around the bull.

Romero took the ear from his brother and held it up toward the President.

The President bowed and Romero, running to get ahead of the crowd, came toward us.

He leaned up against the barrera and gave the ear to Brett.

He nodded his head and smiled.

The crowd were all about him. Brett held down the cape.

"You liked it?" Romero called.

Brett did not say anything. They looked at each other and smiled.

Brett had the ear in her hand.

"Don't get bloody," Romero said, and grinned.

The crowd wanted him. Several boys shouted at Brett.

The crowd was the boys, the dancers, and the drunks.

Romero turned and tried to get through the crowd.

They were all around him trying to lift him and put him on their shoulders.

He fought and twisted away, and started running, in the midst of them, toward the exit.

He did not want to be carried on people's shoulders.

But they held him and lifted him.

It was uncomfortable and his legs were spraddled and his body was very sore.

> ==spraddle英 ['sprædl] 美 ['sprædəl] v. 叉开腿站立，跨越==

They were lifting him and all runningtoward the gate.

He had his hand on somebody's shoulder.

He looked around at us apologetically.

The crowd, running, went out the gate with him.

We all three went back to the hotel.

Brett went upstairs. Bill and I sat in the down-stairs dining-room and ate some hard-boiled eggs and drank several bottles of beer.

Belmonte came down in his street clothes with his manager and two other men.

They sat at the next table and ate. Belmonte ate very little.

They were leaving on the seven o'clock train for Barcelona.

Belmonte wore a blue-striped shirt and a dark suit, and ate soft-boiled eggs.

The others ate a big meal. Belmonte did not talk. He only answered questions.

Bill was tired after the bull-fight. So was I.

We both took a bullfight very hard.

>
> took a bullfight very hard 指“看斗牛看得非常认真”，hard可以理解为to the fullest extent possible, 这里表示注意力很集中、全身心地投入。 

We sat and ate the eggs and I watched Belmonte and the people at his table.

The men with him were tough-looking and businesslike.

"Come on over to the café," Bill said. "I want an absinthe."

It was the last day of the fiesta.

Outside it was beginning to be cloudy again.

The square was full of people and the fireworks experts were making up their set pieces for the night and covering them over with beech branches.

Boys were watching. We passed stands of rockets with long bamboo stems.

Outside the café there was a great crowd.

The music and the dancing were going on.

The giants and the dwarfs were passing.

"Where's Edna?" I asked Bill. "I don't know."

We watched the beginning of the evening of the last night of the fiesta.

The absinthe made everything seembetter.

I drank it without sugar in the dripping glass, and it was pleasantlybitter.

"I feel sorry about Cohn." Bill said "He had a awful time."

"Oh, to hell with Cohn," I said.

"Where do you suppose he went?" "Up to Paris."

"What do you suppose he'll do?" "Oh, to hell with him."

"What do you suppose he'll do?" "Pick up with his old girl, probably."

"Who was his old girl?" "Somebody named Frances."

We had another absinthe.

"When do you go back?" I asked. "To-morrow."

After a little while Bill said: "Well, it was a swell fiesta."

"Yes," I said, "something doing all the time."

"You wouldn't believe it. It's like a wonderful nightmare."

"Sure," I said. "I'd believe anything. Including nightmares."

"What's the matter? Feel low?" "Lowas hell."

"Have another absinthe. Here, waiter! Another absinthe for this señor."

"I feel like hell," I said.

"Drink that," said Bill. "Drink it slow."

It was beginning to get dark. The fiesta was going on.

I began to feel drunk but I did not feel any better.

"How do you feel?" "I feel like hell."

"Have another?" "It won't do any good."

"Try it. You can't tell; maybe this is the one that gets it.

Hey, waiter! Another absinthe for this señor!"

I poured the water directly into it and stirred it instead of letting it drip.

Bill put in a lump of ice. I stirred theice around with a spoon in the brownish, cloudy mixture.

"How is it?" "Fine."

"Don't drink it fast that way. It will make you sick."

I set down the glass. I had not meant to drink it fast.

"I feel tight." "You ought to."

"That's what you wanted, wasn't it?"

"Sure. Get tight. Get over your damn depression."

"Well, I'm tight. Is that what you want?" "Sit down."

"I won't sit down," I said. "I'm going over to the hotel."

I was very drunk. I was drunker than I ever remembered having been.

At the hotel I went up-stairs. Brett's door was open.

I put my head in the room. Mike was sitting on the bed. He waved a bottle.

"Jake," he said. "Come in, Jake."

I went in and sat down. The room was unstable unless I looked at some fixed point.

"Brett, you know. She's gone off with the bull-fighter chap." "No."

"Yes. She looked for you to say good-bye. They went on the seven o'clock train."

"Did they?" "Bad thing to do," Mike said. "She shouldn't have done it."

"No." "Have a drink? Wait while I ring for some beer."

"I'm drunk," I said. "I'm going in and lie down."

"Are you blind? I was blind myself."

"Yes," I said, "I'm blind."

"Well, bung-o," Mike said. "Get some sleep, old Jake."

I went out the door and into my ownroom and lay on the bed.

The bed went sailing off and I sat up in bed and looked at the wall to make it stop.

Outside in the square the fiesta wasgoing on. It did not mean anything.

Later Bill and Mike came in to get me to go down and eat with them. I pretended to be asleep.

"He's asleep. Better let him alone."

"He's blind as a tick," Mike said. They went out.

I got up and went to the balcony and looked out at the dancing in thesquare.

The world was not wheeling any more.

It was just very clear and bright, and inclined to blur at the edges.

I washed, brushed my hair. I lookedstrange to myself in the glass, and went down-stairs to the dining-room.

"Here he is!" said Bill. "Good old Jake! I knew you wouldn't pass out."

"Hello, you old drunk," Mike said.

"I got hungry and woke up."

"Eat some soup," Bill said.

The three of us sat at the table, andit seemed as though about six people were missing.

### 背景知识

**💧****Barcelona**

**巴塞罗那**

我们今天的内容提到Belmonte比赛完要到巴塞罗那去。（They were leaving on the seven o'clock train for Barcelona. ）我们今天就走进巴塞罗那，一起领略一下那里迷人的风光吧。

巴塞罗那位于伊比利亚半岛东北部，濒临地中海（the Mediterranean），是西班牙第二大城市。巴塞罗那是港口城市（port city），是享誉世界的地中海风光旅游目的地和世界著名的历史文化名城，那里气候宜人、风光旖旎、古迹遍布，素有“伊比利亚半岛的明珠”之称。

巴塞罗那人口达400万，仅次于首都马德里（Madrid），也是世界上人口最稠密的城市之一。

巴塞罗那有3种官方语言：加泰罗尼亚语、西班牙语和雅利安语，英语也广泛使用。

巴塞罗那被誉为“高迪之城”（高迪是我们介绍过的米拉之家和巴特罗之家的建筑师，以前卫和疯狂闻名于世）。除了这两座宅邸，圣家族大教堂和古埃尔公园也都出自高迪之手。

圣家堂（Sagrada Familia）

是巴塞罗那最为知名的标志性建筑物。这座倾注了高迪满腔虔诚的圣殿无处不显示着这位天才的奇思妙想，对几何原理的娴熟运用、对自然元素的借鉴和对光线的掌控令这座教堂显得如此超前而又独一无二，站在大厅中间仿佛置身于宇宙的中心，肃穆、壮观又处处流淌着建筑之美。

教堂共设三座立面，分别代表：诞生、受难和荣耀，均有四座支撑塔楼，远远看去如同一樽精巧的蚁穴。

古埃尔公园 (Park Guell)

最吸引人的是那个可以眺望地中海的大平台，平台周围的一圈座椅都用彩色碎瓷砖拼贴，创造出迷人的色彩效果，平台下面布满立柱的大厅则如同森林，抬头还能望见各种星体。最美的时刻是在夕阳西下时分，看着阳光将整座城市与海面镀成温暖的金黄色。

而全公园最受欢迎的合影对象则是公园入口处的那条吐水的“龙”（好多人都觉得是蜥蜴）。



诺坎普球场（Camp Nou）

巴塞罗那除了最著名的建筑，足球又是另一道靓丽风景线。前往球迷朝圣地，体验当地的足球文化和氛围也不失为不错的选择。这里是顶级俱乐部的主场，他的历史比共和国的历史还要长。



巴塞罗那还有著名的足球俱乐部，中文简称是巴萨，作为欧洲乃至世界足坛最成功的俱乐部之一，巴塞罗那足球俱乐部拥有非常高的人气。



毕加索博物馆（Museu Picasso）



世界三座毕加索博物馆之一，大多数人都知道Pablo Picasso的扭曲肖像，这个博物馆展示了他在各种时间轴上的作品，让你跟随他从早期更受控制的作品到他职业生涯结束时非常异想天开的绘画和雕塑的发展。

### 课文理解

在对付第二头公牛的时候，Romero展示了完美的和公牛周旋对抗的技艺，乃至于观众仍然不想这部分表演结束（They did not want the bull killed yet, they did not want it to be over）. 而且Jake还将其形容为“一场斗牛的示范教程”（It was like a course in bull-fighting）. 我们来看两处描述——



💧**Clue 1**: Romero has done perfect job with the second bull.



**Evidence 1**: There were no tricks and no mystifications. There was no brusqueness...The crowd did not want it ever to be finished.

不耍花招，不故弄玄虚。没有草率的动作……观众心想最好这场斗牛永远不要结束。



**Evidence 2:** They were all around him trying to lift him and put him on their shoulders...They were lifting him and all running toward the gate. He had his hand on somebody's shoulder.

他们把他团团围住，想把他举起来，扛在他们的肩上……他们扛着他，大家都向大门跑去。他一只手搭在一个人的肩上 。



观众对Romero表示了极高的崇敬和热情，但Romero却急于退场，这可能跟他身上还有伤痛有关（It was uncomfortable and his legs were spraddled and his body was very sore）, 由此更见他的忍耐和毅力。



这已经是狂欢节的最后一天了，晚上只剩下Bill和Jake一起参与到余兴之中。到处是人群和准备庆祝的烟花（The square was full of people and the fireworks experts were making up their set pieces for the night）. Jake和Bill在一起喝酒的时候提到Edna和Cohn, 但他们都已经离开了（不仅是离开了狂欢节，也是从故事舞台上退下了，在之后的情节里不会再出现）。Jake有意借酒精来麻痹自己，同时也预示着Brett接下来的离开——



💧**Clue 2**:  Jake also tries to relieve his pain through alcohol.



**Evidence 1**: The absinthe made everything seem better. I drank it without sugar in the dripping glass, and it was pleasantly bitter.

苦艾酒促使一切都显得更加美好。我用滴杯不加糖就喝了，味道哭得很可口。



**Evidence 2**: "Sure," I said. "I'd believe anything. Including nightmares."

"What's the matter? Feel low?"

"Low as hell."

“真的。”我说。“我什么都信。连噩梦我都相信。”

“怎么啦？闹情绪了？”

“我难受极了。”我说。



等Jake回到旅馆来到Brett的房间，才发现只有Mike坐在里面，而Brett和Romero已经离开了（"Brett, you know. She's gone off with the bull-fighter chap."）虽然内心沉重，Jake还是打起了精神重新加入到一伙人的晚饭中（I looked strange to myself in the glass, and went down-stairs to the dining-room）. 至此为止，故事的高潮已经结束，主要人物之间的矛盾也都得到了解决。剩下唯一的悬念是，Brett是否从此就和Romero远走高飞了呢？我们一起期待这本书最后一章的情节走向~

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****Reward System of Bullfight**

**斗牛比赛奖励机制**



在我们今天的内容中，有这样的情节，在Romero取得胜利之后，他接过牛耳并向主席致意。

(Romero took the ear from his brother and held it up toward the President.) 胜利者获得牛耳是斗牛比赛的一种奖励形式，我们今天就来看一下斗牛比赛赢得胜利后都有哪些奖励形式吧～



\1. 接受掌声

一个斗牛士在完成一场较为成功的斗牛之后，会得到接受掌声的奖励，通常是他和同伴只面对主席台方向的底层观众，接受人们的鲜花、掌声和骑士帽。这是斗牛士获得的最低规格的一种奖励。



\2. 绕场一周

如果一名斗牛士的表演令人很满意，他和他的3个助手（短标枪手）将获得绕场一周的荣誉，他们环场接受看台上人们的掌声、欢呼声以及扔下的鲜花和帽子、礼品等。



\3. 单耳奖励

如果一名斗牛士的挑逗、动作、刺杀等等全过程表演让人们感到非常满意，全场观众都会为他挥动白色手帕，主席团主席在看到有八成以上的观众挥动白手帕之后，将会决定给予斗牛士获得一只牛耳的奖赏，同时包括绕场一周的殊荣。也就是说，观众拥有是否奖励给斗牛士一只牛耳的权利。



我们今天的内容中有全场挥动手帕，继而主席也挥动他的手帕的场景。（Handkerchiefs were waving all over the bullring. The President looked down from the box and waved his handkerchief. ）接着Romero的哥哥割下牛耳递给Romero， Romero又把象征荣誉的牛耳送给了心爱的Brett. (The brother cut the notched black ear from the dead bull and trotted over with it to Romero... He leaned up against the barrera and gave the ear to Brett. )



\4. 双耳奖励

如果斗牛士的表演令观众为之疯狂，在已经决定奖励斗牛士一只牛耳的基础上，绝大部分观众继续不停地地挥舞白色手帕，要求主席团再次奖励斗牛士，主席团主席有权利决定是否奖励给斗牛士第二只牛耳。能获得两只牛耳的斗牛士证明他已获得了极大成功。



\5. 双耳加牛尾

只有在极少的情况下，主席团会对某位著名的斗牛士在某次成功的表演之后，奖励双耳外加一条牛尾。这是最高级别的奖励，西班牙的8座一级斗牛场和45座二级斗牛场对此项奖励要求极为严格，通常每年总共不会超过10次。到五月份为止，还没有一名斗牛士获得如此殊荣。



\6. 王子门（Puerta del Principe）

通过“王子门”是仅在塞维利亚的Maestranza斗牛场才有的奖励，在西班牙其他斗牛场则没有。当一名斗牛士在一场两轮对两头公牛的比赛中能够得到三只牛耳以上的奖励时，Maestranza斗牛场就将为这名斗牛士打开正面的“王子门”，斗牛士则骑在另一人的肩上炫耀出场，在观众们的欢呼声中走过“王子门”。这也是一名斗牛士莫大的荣誉。

In the morning it was all over. The fiesta was finished.

I woke about nine o'clock, had a bath, dressed, and went down-stairs.

The square was empty and there were no people on the streets.

A few children were picking up rocket-sticks in the square.

The cafés were just opening and the waiters were carrying Out the comfortable white wicker chairs and arranging them around the marble-topped tables in the shade of the arcade.

> ==wicker英 [ˈwɪkə(r)] 美 [ˈwɪkɚ] n. 柳条（编制品）;（编制筐篓的）枝条 adj. 枝条[柳条]编的;装在柳条编织物里的==

They were sweeping the streets andsprinkling them with a hose.

I sat in one of the wicker chairs andleaned back comfortably.

The waiter was in no hurry to come.

The white-paper announcements of the unloading of the bulls and the big schedules of special trains were still up on the pillars of the arcade.

> ==pillar英 [ˈpɪlə(r)] 美 [ˈpɪlɚ] n. 柱，台柱，顶梁柱;墩，柱脚;（组织、制度、信仰等的）核心==

A waiter wearing a blue apron cameout with a bucket of water and a cloth, and commenced to tear down the notices, pulling the paper off in strips and washing and rubbing away the paper that stuck to the stone.

The fiesta was over.I drank a coffeeand after a while Bill came over.

I watched him come walking across the square.

He sat down at the table and ordered a coffee.

"Well," he said, "it's all over."

"Yes," I said. "When do you go?"

"I don't know. We better get a car, I think. Aren't you going back to Paris?"

"No. I can stay away another week. I think I'll go to San Sebastian."

"I want to get back."

"What's Mike going to do?"

"He's going to Saint Jean de Luz."

"Let's get a car and all go as far as Bayonne.

You can get the train up from there to-night."

"Good. Let's go after lunch.""All right. I'll get the car."

We had lunch and paid the bill. Montoya did not come near us.

One of the maids brought the bill. The car was outside.

The chauffeur piled and strapped the bags on top of the car and put them in beside him in the front seat and we got in.

The car went out of the square, along through the side streets, out under the trees and down the hill and away from Pamplona.

It did not seem like a very long ride.

Mike had a bottle of Fundador. I only took a couple of drinks.

We came over the mountains and out of Spain and down the white roads and through the overfoliaged, wet, green, Basque country, and finally into Bayonne.

We left Bill's baggage at the station,and he bought a ticket to Paris.

His train left at seven-ten. We cameout of the station.

The car was standing out in front.

"What shall we do about the car?" Bill asked.

"Oh, bother the car," Mike said. "Let's just keep the car with us."

"All right," Bill said. "Where shall wego?"

"Let's go to Biarritz and have a drink."

"Old Mike the spender," Bill said.

> ==spender英 [ˈspendə(r)] 美 [ˈspɛndɚ] n. 挥金如土的人;挥霍者==

We drove in to Biarritz and left the car outside a very Ritz place.

>
> 我们开进比亚里茨，在一家非常豪华的饭店门口下车。

> **💧表达精讲**

> a very Ritz place “一家非常豪华的饭店”；Ritz可以从两个角度来理解：一是指1902年首创于法国的一家非常豪华的饭店，全称是“里兹·卡尔顿”（Ritz-Carlton）, 所以a very Ritz place就可以理解为“可以与里兹饭店媲美的一家饭店”；另外ritz在美国的俚语里也有“豪华，炫耀，摆场”（ostentatious display of elegance）的意思，比如put on the ritz就是指“排场铺张”；这里ritz可以看作形容词，相当于fancy (very expensive and fashionable).

We went into the bar and sat on high stools and drank a whiskey and soda.

"That drink's mine," Mike said."Let's roll for it."

So we rolled poker dice out of a deep leather dice-cup.

Bill was out first roll.

Mike lost to me and handed the bartender a hundred-franc note.

The whiskeys were twelve francs apiece.

We had another round and Mike lost again. Each time he gave the bartender a good tip.

In a room off the bar there was a good jazz band playing.

It was a pleasant bar. We had another round.

I went out on the first roll with four kings. Bill and Mike rolled.

Mike won the first roll with four jacks. Bill won the second.

On the final roll Mike had three kings and let them stay.

He handed the dice-cup to Bill. Bill rattled them and rolled, and there were three kings, an ace. and a queen.

"It's yours, Mike," Bill said. "Old Mike, the gambler."

"I'm so sorry," Mike said. "I can't getit."

"What's the matter?""I've no money,"Mike said.

"I'm stony. I've just twenty francs. Here, take twenty francs."

Bill's face sort of changed.

"I just had enough to pay Montoya. Damned lucky to have it, too."

"I'll cash you a check," Bill said.

"That's damned nice of you, but yousee I can't write checks."

"What are you going to do for money?"

"Oh, some will come through. I've two weeks allowance should be here.

"What do you want to do about the car?" Bill asked me.

"Do you want to keep it on?"

"It doesn't make any difference. Seems sort of idiotic."

"Come on, let's have another drink,"Mike said.

"Fine. This one is on me," Bill said.

"Has Brett any money?" He turned to Mike.

"I shouldn't think so. She put up most of what I gave to old Montoya."

"She hasn't any money with her?" I asked.

"I shouldn't think so. She never has any money.

She gets five hundred quid a year and pays three hundred and fifty of it in interest to Jews."

"I suppose they get it at the source," said Bill.

"Quite. They're not really Jews. We just call them Jews.

They're Scotsmen, I believe."

"Hasn't she any at all with her?" I asked.

"I hardly think so. She gave it all to me when she left."

"Well," Bill said, "we might as well have another drink."

"Damned good idea," Mike said.

"One never gets anywhere by discussing finances."

"No," said Bill. Bill and I rolled for the next two rounds.

Bill lost and paid. We went out to the car.

"Anywhere you'd like to go, Mike?" Bill asked.

"Let's take a drive. It might do my credit good. Let's drive about a little."

> <font color=red>"Let's take a drive. It might do my credit good. Let's drive about a little."</font>

> It might do my credit good 这句话可以联系下文Mike说的一句话来理解："I haven't any credit along the coast." 这里的credit表示“赊购”，haven't any credit也就是“没有赊账”，言下之意是他没有在沿海这一带转悠过以致于欠下钱款，所以去兜风也不会碰上什么债主，“do my credit good”是一种调侃的说法。

"Fine. I'd like to see the coast. Let's drive down toward Hendaye."

"I haven't any credit along the coast."

"You can't ever tell," said Bill.

We drove out along the coast road.

There was the green of the headlands, the white, red-roofed villas, patches of forest, and the ocean very blue with the tide out and the water curling far out along the beach.

We drove through Saint Jean de Luz and passed through villages farther down the coast.

Back of the rolling country we were going through we saw the mountains we had come over from Pamplona.

The road went on ahead. Bill lookedat his watch.

It was time for us to go back.

He knocked on the glass and told the driver to turn around.

The driver backed the car out into the grass to turn it.

In back of us were the woods, below a stretch of meadow, then the sea.

At the hotel where Mike was going to stay in Saint Jean we stopped the car and he got out.

The chauffeur carried in his bags. Mike stood by the side of the car.

"Good-bye, you chaps," Mike said.

"It was a damned fine fiesta."

"So long, Mike," Bill said.

"I'll see you around," I said.

"Don't worry about money," Mike said.

"You can pay for the car, Jake, and I'll send you my share."

"So long, Mike."

"So long, you chaps. You've been damned nice."

We all shook hands. We waved from the car to Mike.

He stood in the road watching. We got to Bayonne just before the train left.

A porter carried Bill's bags in from the consigne.

I went as far as the inner gate to the tracks.

"So long, fella," Bill said."So long, kid!"

"It was swell. I've had a swell time."

"Will you be in Paris?"

"No, I have to sail on the 17th. So long, fella!"

"So long, old kid!"He went in through the gate to the train.

The porter went ahead with the bags. I watched the train pull out.

Bill was at one of the windows. The window passed, the rest of the train passed, and the tracks were empty.

I went outside to the car."How muchdo we owe you?" I asked the driver.

The price to Bayonne had been fixed at a hundred and fifty pesetas.

"Two hundred pesetas.""How much more will it be if you drive me to San Sebastian on your way back?"

"Fifty pesetas.""Don't kid me.""Thirty-five pesetas."

"It's not worth it," I said. "Drive me to the Hotel Panier Fleuri."

At the hotel I paid the driver and gave him a tip.

The car was powdered with dust. I rubbed the rod-case through the dust.

It seemed the last thing that connected me with Spain and the fiesta.

The driver put the car in gear and went down the street.

I watched it turn off to take the roadto Spain.

I went into the hotel and they gave me a room.

It was the same room I had slept in when Bill and Cohn and I were in Bayonne.

That seemed a very long time ago.

I washed, changed my shirt, and went out in the town.

**💧****Train Station in Spain**

**西班牙的火车站**

我们今天的内容提到了Jake，Bill和Make三人在火车站分别的场景。（I watched the train pull out. Bill was at one of the windows. The window passed, the rest of the train passed, and the tracks were empty. ）火车站总是隐匿着不舍和离别的愁绪，海明威的作品中也多次提到西班牙境内火车站的场景。

他的作品《白象似的群山》（*Hills Like White Elephants*）就发生在西班牙北部一个名不见经传的小火车站，一对年轻的情侣正在等待去巴塞罗那的列车，故事就围绕着火车没来的40分钟内他们关于堕胎的对话展开。

海明威也将他的深情寄于火车站，在《流动的盛宴》（*A Moveable Feast*）最后的篇章中，海明威曾这么写道：When I saw my wife again standing by the tracks as the train came in by the piled logs at the station, I wished I had died before I ever loved anyone but her. （等火车终于在一堆原木旁驶进车站时我又见到了我的妻子，她站在铁轨边，我想我情愿死去也不愿除了她去爱任何别人。）那个女人就是他的第一任妻子哈德莉。



今天我们一起来领略一下西班牙美丽的火车站吧～

马德里阿托查火车站

这座火车站就是一整座艺术品，它将砖、铁、玻璃以及热带花园融合在一起。每个到阿托查车站的游客，都会惊叹于这样一个神奇的组合。



瓦伦西亚火车北站

在瓦伦西亚，这座在1917年落成的火车北站，极具个性和现代主义风格。它占地面积大，装饰华丽，在1983年被列为西班牙国家文化遗产。



毕尔巴鄂康科迪亚火车站

毕尔巴鄂的康科迪亚火车站，也被称为桑坦德火车站。 在1902年建于毕尔巴鄂新城边上，位于内维翁河边。火车站极具现代主义风格，车站外墙有大量的花纹装饰。它被视为毕尔巴鄂在“美好年代” (19世纪末至第一次世界大战前的相对和平时期) 的重要文化遗产。



赫雷斯边境火车站

位于安达卢西亚加的赫雷斯边境火车站是一个有故事的火车站。它是西班牙最早的铁路线之一，也是安达卢西亚的第一条铁路线。赫雷斯著名的葡萄酒最初就是火车从这个车站出发驶向港口，最后运往英国。

赫雷斯边境火车站结合了文艺复兴时期的建筑风格与新穆德哈尔建筑元素。具有极高的建筑价值，被西班牙政府列为国家文化遗产，也成为西班牙最美的火车站之一。

### 课文理解

第二天早上，狂欢节已经彻底完全结束了，Jake独自来到大街上。作者还在这里精心安排了一个细节和狂欢节伊始的景象形成对比——

💧**Clue 1**: The fiesta is all over.

**Evidence 1**: The cafés were just opening and the waiters were carrying out the comfortable white wicker chairs and arranging them around the marble-topped tables in the shade of the arcade.

咖啡馆刚刚开门，服务生正在把舒适的白色柳条椅搬出来，在拱廊的阴凉地里围着大理石面的桌子摆好。



**Evidence 2:** I sat in one of the wicker chairs and leaned back comfortably. The waiter was in no hurry to come.

我挑了把柳条椅坐下，舒舒服服地往后一靠。服务生也不忙着招呼了。

我们来回顾一下狂欢节第一天的情景：咖啡馆所有大理石面的桌子和柳条椅都被换成了铸铁的桌子和简陋的折叠的椅（The marble-topped tables and the white wicker chairs were gone. They were replaced by cast-iron tables and severe folding chairs. — Chapter 15.1）并且只要一坐下来就会有服务生过来招呼（Today the waiters did not leave you alone all morning to read without asking if you wanted to order something. A waiter came up as soon as I sat down. — Chapter 15.1）



在分道扬镳之前，Jake, Mike和Bill又重新聚在一起，但这次他们也不外乎喝酒、闲聊或是开车四处兜风。这三个人的对话也再次印证了对这群年轻人（迷惘的一代）来说，生活就是不断地在挥霍和困顿之间转换，并且任何对于生命意义以及价值的探询，最后都只能无疾而终——



💧**Clue 2**:  Life is purposeless and meaningliess.



**Evidence 1**: "Old Mike the spender," Bill said.

We drove in to Biarritz and left the car outside a very Ritz place. We went into the bar and sat on high stools and drank a whiskey and soda.

“挥金如土的好迈克。”比尔说。

我们开进比亚里茨，在一家非常豪华的饭店门口下车。我们走进酒吧间，坐在高凳上喝威士忌苏打。



**Evidence 2**: "Well," Bill said, "we might as well have another drink."

"Damned good idea," Mike said. "One never gets anywhere by discussing finances."

“得了，”比尔说。“我们不如再喝一杯吧。”

“这个主意太好了。”迈克说。“空谈钱财解决不了任何问题。”



Mike虽然已经穷得叮当响了（"I've no money," Mike said. "I'm stony. I've just twenty francs. Here, take twenty francs."）但还是依然不改挥霍无度的习惯，在给小费的时候也出手阔绰（Each time he gave the bartender a good tip.）接着他提到在Pamplona的时候，几乎都是Brett出的房费（"She put up most of what I gave to old Montoya."）



而Mike最后得出的这句结论“One never gets anywhere by discussing finances.”里，one never gets anywhere也可以看作是对这种只能荒废虚度的生活的总结。Mike自己就绝妙地诠释了这句话，他几乎是这本书里从头矬到尾的一个角色：先前他是一个欠了一屁股债、试图攀附上Brett的醉汉，但到了故事结尾，他也没有丝毫改变。其实这也是其他角色的命运，就如Jake所说，“除了斗牛士，没有人的人生是一路高歌猛进的。”（"Nobody ever lives their life all the way up except bullfighters."）

**💧English in Poker**

**扑克牌中的英语**



我们今天的内容当中有大家一起掷扑克骰子来决定谁来付账的情节（So we rolled poker dice out of a deep leather dice-cup. ）接着出现了jack，king，queen和 ace（至尊），这四个单词分别代表扑克牌中的”J、K、Q和A”，我们今天就来一起了解一下扑克牌里的英语和典故吧～



扑克牌（playing Card / poker）起源于远东地区，14世纪传入欧洲。今天扑克牌中的四种花色采用的是法国16世纪通行的规则： “黑桃”（spade）代表橄榄叶，象征和平；“红桃”（heart)）象征智慧和爱情；“梅花” （club）起源于三叶草，代表幸福；“方块”（diamond）代表财富。



\1. K ：King（国王）

黑桃K（the king of spades）人物原型：David（大卫）

我们常见到的是米开朗琪罗（Michelangelo）的雕塑作品《大卫》就是这位犹太人的王。

幼年大卫是个牧羊的孩子。在和非利士人（Philistines）的战斗中，用甩兜甩石，杀死令以色列众人惊恐的非利士勇士—巨人歌利亚，从而一战成名。大卫王被描述为最正义的国王，他还是一位音乐家和诗人。



红桃 K（the king of hearts）人物原型：查理大帝Charlemagne（查理曼）

查理曼，法兰克王国国王，征服了西欧与中欧大部分土地，重振西罗马帝国，建立了囊括西欧大部分地区的庞大帝国。他死后帝国分裂，他的三个孙子各自为王，东法兰克王国成了以后的德国，西法兰克王国成了以后的法国，东、西部之间的地区则成了以后的意大利。



红桃K上的查理曼大帝左手执剑，右手按着御服长袍的镶边，头发内卷。据说从前印刷是采用木版雕版印刷，一位雕刻印版的职员不小心把查理曼木刻版上上唇的胡子刮掉了，所以红桃K成了唯一没有上唇胡子的国王牌。



\2. Q ：Queen（女王）

黑桃 Q（the queen of spades）人物原型：Pallas Athene （帕拉斯·雅典娜）

宙斯与智慧女神墨提斯（Metis）所生，据说她有宙斯一般的力量，是智慧与力量的完美结合。她是希腊神话中的女战神、也是智慧女神，雅典就是以她命名的。雅典娜是四张王后牌中唯一手持武器的王后。



方块 Q（the queen of diamonds）人物原型：Rachel雷切尔或莱克尔皇后

雅各的第二个妻子，约瑟夫和本杰明的母亲。雅各为了娶她，给自己的舅舅白做了十四年的工。传说是一位非常貌美的女子，她的姐姐利亚是雅各的第一任妻子。



\3. J ：Jack（侍从—此外还有水手seaman和千斤顶的意思）

黑桃J（the jack of spades）人物原型：Ogier(霍吉尔)

是查尔斯一世的侍从，丹麦人霍吉尔是一个虚构的丹麦英雄，曾立下赫赫战功，最后在比利牛斯山脉的战役中不幸身亡。黑桃J手上原本持矛，现却印成方天棍。



梅花J（The jack of clubs）人物原型：兰斯洛特(Lancelot)

英格兰传说中的人物，是亚瑟王圆桌骑士团中的一员。传说中他是一名出色的箭手，因此梅花J手持箭支。兰斯洛特与王后的恋爱导致了他与亚瑟王之间的战争。



下面我们再来了解几个打扑克牌会用到的词吧～



red Joker 大王 

black Joker小王



deck 一副牌   

shuffle 洗牌

cut 倒牌

deal 分牌

例如：You have to shuffle the cards before the cut for deal. 

你得先洗牌，然后再倒牌和发牌。



trump 王牌

例如：He played a trump.

他打了一张王牌。

At a newspaper kiosque I bought a copy of the New York Herald and sat in a café to read it.

It felt strange to be in France again.There was a safe, suburban feeling.

I wished I had gone up to Paris withBill, except that Paris would have meant more fiesta-ing.

I was through with fiestas for a while. It would be quiet in San Sebastian.

> <font color=red>There was a safe, suburban feeling. I wished I had gone up to Paris with Bill, except that Paris would have meant more fiesta-ing. I was through with fiestas for a while.</font>

I could get a good hotel room and read and swim. There was a fine beach there.

There were wonderful trees along the promenade above the beach, and there were many children sent down with their nurses before the season opened.

In the evening there would be band concerts under the trees across from the Café Marinas.

I could sit in the Marinas and listen.

"How does one eat inside?" I asked the waiter. Inside the café was a restaurant.

"Well. Very well. One eats very well." "Good."

I went in and ate dinner. It was a big meal for France but it seemed very carefully apportioned after Spain.

> ==apportion==
>
> v. 分配，分派（to divide sth among people; to give a share of sth to sb）
>
> 原文：It was a big meal for France but it seemed very carefully apportioned after Spain.

> Château Margaux 指“玛歌酒庄”，它是法国波尔多地区的一家一级酒庄。波尔多城所在的纪龙德省是著名的葡萄酒产区，其产品统称波尔多葡萄酒，具体名称则往往以酿酒商的大葡萄种植园命名。
>
> Château 这个词在法语里本来是“古堡，城堡”的意思，相当于castle. 也可以指贵族或者比较有权势和金钱的人修的建筑或宅邸，比如凡尔赛宫的法文名就是“Château de Versailles”. 后来Château才开始用来指葡萄酒庄园。

It was pleasant to be drinking slowlyand to be tasting the wine and to bedrinking alone.

A bottle of wine was good company.Afterward I had coffee.

The waiter recommended a Basque liqueur called Izzarra.

He brought in the bottle and poured a liqueur-glass full.

He said Izzarra was made of the flowers of the Pyrenees.

The veritable flowers of the Pyrenees. It looked like hair-oil and smelled like Italian strega.

> ==veritable英 [ˈverɪtəbl] 美 [ˈvɛrɪtəbəl] adj. 名副其实的；真正的==

I told him to take the flowers of the Pyrenees away and bring me a vieux marc ([法]陈年白兰地).

The marc was good. I had a second marc after the coffee.

The waiter seemed a little offended about the flowers of the Pyrenees, so I overtipped him.

That made him happy. It felt comfortable to be in a country where it is so simple to make people happy.

You can never tell whether a Spanish waiter will thank you.

Everything is on such a clear financial basis in France.

It is the simplest country to live in. No one makes things complicated by becoming your friend for any obscure reason.

> ==obscure英 [əbˈskjʊə(r)] 美 [əbˈskjʊr] adj. 昏暗的，朦胧的；晦涩的，不清楚的；隐蔽的；不著名的，无名的 vt. 使…模糊不清，掩盖；隐藏；使难理解 n. 某种模糊的或不清楚的东西==

>
> 树木遮挡了他的视线，南半广场的一大部分他都无法看清。

If you want people to like you you have only to spend a little money.

I spent a little money and the waiterliked me. He appreciated my valuable qualities. He would be gladto see me back.

I would dine there again some time and he would be glad to see me, and would want me at his table.

It would be a sincere liking because it would have a sound basis. I was back in France.

> <font color=red>It would be a sincere liking because it would have a sound basis.</font>
>
> 这种喜欢是真诚的，因为有坚实的基础。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> a sound basis 即指上文提到的“Everything is on such a clear financial basis in France. ”（在法国，一切都建立在这种赤裸裸的金钱基础上。）也就是只要给人以金钱上的好处，就可以建立稳定真诚的关系。

Next morning I tipped every one a little too much at the hotel to make more friends, and left on the morning train for San Sebastian.

At the station I did not tip the porter more than I should because I did not think I would ever see him again.

I only wanted a few good French friends in Bayonne to make me welcome in case I should come back there again.

I knew that if they remembered me their friendship would be loyal.

At Irun we had to change trains and show passports. I hated to leave France.

Life was so simple in France. I felt I was a fool to be going back into Spain.

In Spain you could not tell about anything.

I felt like a fool to be going back into it, but I stood in line with my passport, opened my bags for the customs, bought a ticket, went through a gate, climbed onto the train, and after forty minutes and eight tunnels I was at San Sebastian.

Even on a hot day San Sebastian has a certain early-morning quality.

The trees seem as though their leaves were never quite dry.

The streets feel as though they had just been sprinkled.

> ==sprinkle英 [ˈsprɪŋkl] 美 [ˈsprɪŋkəl] v. 洒，撒;用…点缀;下小雨 n. 小雨;少量==

It is always cool and shady on certain streets on the hottest day.

I went to a hotel in the town where I had stopped before, and they gave me a room with a balcony that opened out above the roofs of the town.

There was a green mountainside beyond the roofs.

I unpacked my bags and stacked my books on the table beside the head of the bed, put out my shavingthings, hung up some clothes in the big armoire, and made up a bundle for the laundry.

Then I took a shower in the bathroom and went down to lunch.

Spain had not changed to summer-time, so I was early. I set my watch again.

I had recovered an hour by coming to San Sebastian.

As I went into the dining-room the concierge brought me a police bulletin to fill out.

> ==concierge英 [ˈkɒnsieəʒ] 美 [kɔ:nˈsjerz] n. 看门人，门房==

I signed it and asked him for two telegraph forms, and wrote a message to the Hotel Montoya, telling them to forward all mail and telegrams for me to this address.

I calculated how many days I would be in San Sebastian and then wroteout a wire to the office asking them to hold mail, but forward all wires for me to San Sebastian for six days.

Then I went in and had lunch. After lunch I went up to my room, read a while, and went to sleep.

When I woke it was half past four. I found my swimming-suit, wrapped it with a comb in a towel, and went down-stairs and walked up the street to the Concha.

The tide was about half-way out. The beach was smooth and firm, and the sand yellow.

I went into a bathing-cabin, undressed, put on my suit, and walked across the smooth sand to the sea.

The sand was warm under bare feet. There were quite a few people in the water and on the beach.

Out beyond where the headlands of the Concha almost met to form the harbor there was a white line of breakers and the open sea.

> <font color=red>Out beyond where the headlands of the Concha almost met to form the harbor there was a white line of breakers and the open sea.</font>

>
> ③a white line of breakers “一排白白的浪花”，breaker指“拍打在岸上的白浪”（a large wave with a white top that rolls onto the shore）;break作动词就有“（波浪）迸溅，拍岸”的意思，比如：We sat and watched the wavesbreaking on the shore.（我们坐着看波涛拍击海岸。） 

Although the tide was going out, there were a few slow rollers.

They came in like undulations in thewater, gathered weight of water, and then broke smoothly on the warm sand. I waded out.

> ==undulation英 [ˌʌndjuˈleɪʃn] 美 [ˌʌndʒəˈleɪʃn] n. 波动；波荡==

>
> ③broke smoothly on the warm sand “和缓地冲刷到温暖的沙滩上”；这里的break也就是我们在上一句讲解的“拍岸”的意思。

The water was cold. As a roller came I dove, swam out under water, and came to the surface withall the chill gone.

I swam out to the raft, pulled myselfup, and lay on the hot planks.

A boy and girl were at the other end. The girl had undone the top strap of her bathing-suit and was browning her back.

The boy lay face downward on the raft and talked to her.

She laughed at things he said, and turned her brown back in the sun. I lay on the raft in the sun until I was dry.

Then I tried several dives. I dove deep once, swimming down to the bottom.

I swam with my eyes open and it was green and dark. The raft made a dark shadow.

I came out of the water beside the raft, pulled up, dove once more, holding it for length, and then swamashore.

I lay on the beach until I was dry, then went into the bathing-cabin, took off my suit, sloshed myself withfresh water, and rubbed dry.

I walked around the harbor under the trees to the casino, and then up one of the cool streets to the Café Marinas.

> ==casino英 [kəˈsi:nəʊ] 美 [kəˈsi:noʊ] n. 赌场 ；俱乐部，娱乐场 ；小别墅==

There was an orchestra playing inside the café and I sat out on the terrace and enjoyed the fresh coolness in the hot day, and had a glass of lemonjuice and shaved ice and then a long whiskey and soda.

> ==terrace英 [ˈterəs] 美 [ˈtɛrɪs] n. 阳台 ；台阶，阶地 ；柱廊，门廊 ；斜坡上房屋间的街巷 vt. 把（如山坡或坡地）修成梯田 ；给（如房屋）建阳台==

I sat in front of the Marinas for a long time and read and watched thepeople, and listened to the music.

Later when it began to get dark, I walked around the harbor and out along the promenade, and finally back to the hotel for supper.

> ==promenade英 [ˌprɒməˈnɑ:d] 美 [ˌprɑ:məˈneɪd] n. 散步，闲逛；通道，走廊；舞会；骑马 vt.& vi. 散步；漫步；骑马==

There was a bicycle-race on, the Tour du Pays Basque, and the riders were stopping that night in San Sebastian.

In the dining-room, at one side, there was a long table of bicycle-riders, eating with their trainers and managers.

They were all French and Belgians, and paid close attention to their meal, but they were having a good time.

At the head of the table were two good-looking French girls, with much Rue du Faubourg Montmartre chic.

I could not make out whom they belonged to.

They all spoke in slang at the long table and there were many private jokes and some jokes at the far endthat were not repeated when the girls asked to hear them.

The next morning at five o'clock the race resumed with the last lap, San Sebastian-Bilbao.

The bicycle-riders drank much wine,and were burned and browned by the sun.

They did not take the race seriouslyexcept among themselves.

They had raced among themselves so often that it did not make much difference who won.

Especially in a foreign country. The money could be arranged.

The man who had a matter of two minutes lead in the race had an attack of boils, which were very painful.

He sat on the small of his back. Hisneck was very red and the blond hairs were sunburned.

The other riders joked him about hisboils. He tapped on the table with his fork.

"Listen," he said, "to-morrow my nose is so tight on the handlebars that the only thing touches those boils is a lovely breeze."

One of the girls looked at him down the table, and he grinned and turned red.

The Spaniards, they said, did not know how to pedal.

### 背景知识

**💧****Daylight Saving Time and Winter Time**

**夏令时和冬令时**

我们今天的内容中有这样一个场景：Jake 回到西班牙（Spain had not changed to summer-time, so I was early. I set my watch again. I had recovered an hour by coming to San Sebastian. 那时西班牙还没有改用夏令时，因此我来早了。我把表拨回了一小时。来到圣塞瓦斯蒂安，我找回了一个钟头。）那么夏令时是什么？为什么Jake 要将表拨回一小时呢？

我们平常用的是格林尼治标准时间（Greenwich Mean Time），到了三月，就在格林尼治标准时的基础上拨快一个小时，新的时间就是夏令时。到了十月，又在夏令时的基础上拨慢一个小时，就形成冬令时了。

地区和时间

目前，全球约有70个国家和地区实行夏令时和冬令时，欧盟从3月最后一个星期天到10月最后一个星期天实行夏令时。英国的夏令时是从3月的最后一个星期天开始，到10月的最后一个星期天结束。美国和加拿大从3月的第二个星期天至11月的第一个星期天实行夏令时。



为什么要实行夏令时和冬令时？

在昼长夜短的季节将时间调快一个小时，有利于充分利用阳光，缩短照明时间，从而达到节能减排的效果。根据法国调查报告显示，2009年夏令时的实施节约了至少440亿度电，这相当于法国80万个家庭一年的用电量。同时，夏令时也旨在提醒人们早起早睡，养成良好的生活习惯，提高生活质量。



不利影响引发争议

过渡时期那一个小时的时差会将人们的生物钟彻底扰乱，紊乱的生物钟将会使人们出现睡眠障碍，影响工作和学习，也会造成人体内分泌失调、免疫力下降，甚至出现中风。法国研究者发现，在冬夏时令交替之际，心脏病的发病率明显偏高，季节性忧郁症患者也明显偏多，自杀率也会上升，目前引起了广泛的争议。



欧盟提议废止

欧盟委员会决定，欧洲将在2019年3月31日星期日最后一次拨动时钟的指针。欧盟主席提议欧洲从2019年起不再执行时令转换，但各成员可根据情况自行决定。对于决定保留使用夏时令的国家， 2019年10月27日星期日将不用进行调整。

现在的手机、电脑等智能设备一般都会自动更新夏令时和冬令时，所以大家去欧美国家也是不用担心的～ 

### 课文理解

在前往西班牙的San Sabastian之前，Jake停留在法国和西班牙交界处的Bayonne小镇（在前往Pamplona之前，Jake和Bill从巴黎坐火车来这里和从San Sabastian来的Cohn会合）。自从这些在西班牙的日子以来，Jake重新回到这座法国小镇，感受到了两个国家的氛围明显不同——



💧**Clue 1**: The difference between France and Spain is repeated.



**Evidence 1**: That made him happy. It felt comfortable to be in a country where it is so simple to make people happy. You can never tell whether a Spanish waiter will thank you.

这让他非常高兴。置身于一个这么容易就能让人高兴起来的国度，感觉很是舒服。你永远都搞不清一个西班牙服务生会不会感谢你。



**Evidence 2:** No one makes things complicated by becoming your friend for any obscure reason. If you want people to like you you have only to spend a little money.

没有任何人会出于任何一种含混费解的原因而成为你的朋友，把问题复杂化。你要是想让大家喜欢你，只需稍微破费点就行了。



从表面上来看，法国和西班牙最大的不同在于，在法国只要给人一点小恩小惠就可以获得好感，而且这种好感还是有坚实基础的（It would be a sincere liking because it would have a sound basis）. 比如这里Jake只是额外多给了服务生一点小费就得到了诚挚的感谢，这在西班牙则是很难得的。



从现实层面来看，在法国的这种简单直接的交流和相处方式，和实际生活其实有着很大的差距，因为很多时候付出和得到并不是等价的（意味着“有钱就可以得到任何想要的东西”这个逻辑是不成立的）。而西班牙更像是生活本身（represents life itself）, 存在着诸多复杂和不确定的因素（often difficult and unpredictable）. 基于这个差别，Jake也表示自己非常不愿意再回到西班牙，他希望能留在法国（I hated to leave France. Life was so simple in France. I felt I was a fool to be going back into Spain）.



再回到原文，今天的篇幅有很大一部分都是对Jake一个人在San Sabastian的描述。关于Jake为什么要来到这里，可能的解释是Cohn和Brett曾经一起单独到这里游玩。但Jake不是为了重温，而是在预演自己之后可能要面对的孤独生活——



💧**Clue 2**:  Jake is rehearsing for the rest of his sorrowful life.



**Evidence 1**: I lay on the raft in the sun until I was dry. Then I tried several dives. I dove deep once, swimming down to the bottom.

我躺在大太阳底下的木排上，直到把自己晒干。然后我尝试着潜了几次水。有一次我潜得极深，一直朝海底游去。



**Evidence 2**: I walked around the harbor under the trees to the casino, and then up one of the cool streets to the Café Marinas...Later when it began to get dark, I walked around the harbor and out along the promenade, and finally back to the hotel for supper.

我在树荫底下沿着海湾走到赌场，然后选一条阴凉的街道朝“海滨”咖啡馆走去。咖啡馆里有一支乐队正在演奏……一直等天开始黑下来了，我才起身，沿着海湾走了一段，然后走上海滨的散步大道，最后回到旅馆吃晚饭。



除了游泳和潜水以外，Jake基本都在小城里到处闲逛（I walked around...I walked around）, 似乎隐约暗示了他对自己接下来生活的期待也是这样漫无目的地四处游走。唯一的亮点也许就是他遇到了一群来自法国和比利时的自行车赛车手。如果说斗牛士西班牙的国粹，那么自行车也就是法国人可以胜过西班牙人并且引以为傲的一项运动了：The Spaniards, they said, did not know how to pedal.（pedal是“蹬自行车”的意思）。

**高阶学习者的必备外刊**



我们今天的内容中有这样的场景：Jake在书报亭买了一份《纽约先驱报》，坐在一家咖啡馆里看起来。（At a newspaper kiosque I bought a copy of the New York Herald and sat in a café to read it. ）



New York Herald（《纽约先驱报》）是美国早期报纸。1835年由詹姆斯·戈登·贝内特在纽约创办。售价一美分。以通俗性为特色,宣称不支持任何党派,不充当任何派别或小圈子的代言人,热衷于报导暴力和道德堕落事件,因而招致同行与社会的批评,但仍旧日益兴旺。



今天我们就来一起了解一下还有那些优秀的外刊吧，大家日常的英语学习中也要多获取外刊资源来学习哦～
