## 背景知识

两个关键词，product-minded（产品思维）和 engineer（工程师）

像宝洁这样的传统公司，产品的定位和功能都已经趋于稳定，能创造更大价值的环节往往集中在营销和销售活动中，因此传统行业中的产品经理工作重心也往往是偏营销的。但是，我们现在常见的互联网公司的产品经理，更多的是需要思考产品的使用场景、用户体验和商业价值，然后开展发现需求、定义功能和设计原型等工作，这就是所谓的“产品思维”，也就是文章标题里提到的 product-minded。

产品经理需要向工程师准确地传达公司的战略意图、产品的核心价值、设计背后的需求逻辑等，工程师则需要具备所谓的“技术思维”或“工程思维”，从技术实现的角度去考虑系统架构、开发成本等问题。一个优秀的产品经理除了懂客户、懂商业，还需要懂技术，在和工程师互动的过程中，要不断深入了解“工程思维”，并将“产品思维”或者“用户思维”与“工程思维”结合起来，这往往是很多公司招聘产品经理的基本条件之一。

有了这些知识，我们再来看这篇文章的题目，它是从软件工程师的角度出发，强调在编程的过程中要具有“产品思维”，做一个 product-minded software engineer，思考用户场景和商业价值，避免出现与现实脱节、为设计而设计的问题。

Product-minded engineers are developers with lots of interest in the product itself. They want to understand why decisions are made, how people use the product, and love to be involved in making product decisions. They're someone who would likely make a good product manager if they ever decide to give up the joy of engineering. I've worked with many great product-minded engineers and consider myself to be this kind of developer. At companies building world-class products, product-minded engineers take teams to a new level of impact.

[Sherif Mansour](https://twitter.com/sherifmansour), PM at Atlassian wrote [an excellent article](https://medium.com/@sherifmansour/product-engineers-f424da766871) on product engineers, and how product managers can identify these people and work well with them. His takeaway is similar:

> _Over my last ten years of product management, **I’ve come to conclude that product engineers are a critical ingredient to helping you build a successful product**, scale yourself and become a better product manager._

He also quotes [Jean-Michel Lemieux](https://twitter.com/jmwind), head of engineering at Shopify who defines product engineers like this:

> _Once you have the product foundations, you need devs who engage with the 'why', actively. Engineers who have the thirst for using technologies to leapfrog human/user problems. Those with empathy to reach for magical experiences. That is what defined a product engineer in my books. Bad ones cut too many corners. **Great product engineers know that minimum lovable products need the right depth** to be considered during the build phase._

Teams who are working on user-facing features, collaborating with product managers are environments where product-minded engineers can have a huge impact. They often become key contributors, the goto people for product managers and frequently advance to being team leads. **So, what are the key traits of product-minded engineers, and how can you work on becoming more product-minded?** This article summarizes 9 traits I've observed these kinds of people share, and [my suggestions for any engineer to grow their product-minded muscle](#tips-to-become-a-more-product-minded-engineer).

1. Proactive with product ideas/opinions
----------------------------------------

Product-minded engineers don’t settle for getting a specification and jumping to implement it. They think about other ideas and approach the product manager with these. They often challenge existing specifications, suggesting alternative product approaches, that might work better.

2. Interest in the business, user behavior and data on this
-----------------------------------------------------------

When coming with ideas, product-minded engineers don't just get these from thin air. They take the time to understand how the business works, how the product fits in, and what its goals are. They are also empathetic about how the product makes users feel and how those users benefit from using this product. They often dive straight to data about business and user metrics, getting their hands on this data however they can. They might access it directly - if this is possible - or approach the product manager or data scientists to get this kind of information. They do this because of their curious nature. This is the next trait I've observed.

3. Curiosity and a keen interest in "why?"
------------------------------------------

Product-minded engineers like to understand the "why?" behind all things. Why build this feature for the product, why not the other one? Why ship this first milestone, instead of choosing another one, that's a lot simpler to build? How will things be measured - why don't we choose a more thorough way to measure things?

They are autonomous in finding answers they can, by themselves. They turn to the product manager and other people in the business for other, product-related questions. Even though they ask many questions, doing this frequently, they manage not to annoy people, as they've built up strong relationships with them.

4. Strong communicators and great relationships with non-engineers
------------------------------------------------------------------

Product-minded engineers like talking with people outside engineering, learning about what and why they do. They are smooth communicators, making it clear they're interested in learning more about how other disciplines work. I frequently see them grabbing coffee, lunch, or doing a hallway chat with non-engineers.

5. Offering product/engineering tradeoffs upfront
-------------------------------------------------

Because they have a strong understanding of the product "why," as well as the engineering side of things, they can bring suggestions that few other people can. For example, when scoping the effort to build the product, the engineering effort to build a key feature might be significant. Many engineers would start to look for ways to reduce the effort and try to figure out what the impact of the reduced effort would mean for the feature itself.

Product-minded engineers attack this problem from both angles: both looking for engineering tradeoffs and what the product impact is. They also start making product tradeoffs, evaluating the engineering impact. They often go back to the product manager, suggesting a completely different feature to be built, given the product impact would be similar, but the engineering effort vastly smaller.

**Juggling both the product and engineering tradeoffs and the impact of each is a unique strength product-minded engineers have.** They can quickly go back-and-forth between the two sides of the same coin: product features and engineering effort and tradeoffs. Because they do it all in their head, using their engineering and product insights, they get to valuable conclusions remarkably quickly.

6. Pragmatic handling of edge cases
-----------------------------------

Edge cases are a funny thing. On one extreme, engineers often forget about many of these, having to come back to addressing them, after getting feedback from people testing the product or end users. On the other hand, handling all possible edge cases in a new product or feature can take a lot of time.

**Product-minded engineers quickly map out edge cases and think of ways to reduce work on them: often bringing solutions that require no engineering work.** They are focused on the "minimum lovable product concept" and evaluate the impact of an edge case and the effort of handling it. They come with good middle-ground suggestions: mapping out most things that can go wrong and bring suggestions on what edge cases need to be addressed, before shipping even an early version.

For example, if one in a thousand users might be hit by an error, they will consider the effort to fix it and think about what happens if they don't do anything. Can customer support help the person in this case, during validation? Can the user just retry and succeed the next time? Can the product be slightly modified, so this edge case won't occur?

7. Quick product validation cycles
----------------------------------

Even before the feature they are working on is production-ready, product-minded engineers find creative ways to get early feedback. This could be doing hallway testing with colleagues, showing the work-in-progress feature to the product manager, organizing a team bug bash on the beta build, and many other, creative ways. They are continuously thinking:"how can we validate that people will use this feature, the way we think they will?"

8. End-to-end product feature ownership
---------------------------------------

Most experienced engineers own their work end-to-end: from getting the specification, through implementing it, all the way to rolling it out and validating that it works correctly. Product-minded engineers often go a step beyond this.

They consider their work done only after getting results on user behavior and business metrics. After rollout, they still actively engage with product managers, data scientists, and customer support channels, to learn how the feature is being used in the real world. It can take weeks to get enough reliable data to draw conclusions. Even though they might be working on a new project, they make checking on the results one of their top priorities. It's not a time-consuming activity, but it needs that additional persistence from someone wanting to know: how is my work _really_ doing?

When a feature performs worse than expected, they are curious to understand where the mismatch was. They are just as interested in finding the root cause between the product plan and the real world result, as they are to debug a hard-to-reproduce bug in the codebase. They'll often spend a good amount of time debating hypothesizes and learnings with the product manager and data scientists.

9. Strong product instincts through repeated cycles of learning
---------------------------------------------------------------

A typical project for a product-minded engineer usually goes like this:

1.  They ask a lot of questions to understand exactly why the product feature is being built.
2.  They bring suggestions and tradeoffs to the table, some of which are included in the revised spec.
3.  They build the feature quickly, getting early feedback, as they do.
4.  After shipping the feature, they actively follow up to understand if the feature lives up to the expectation.
5.  When it does not, they dig deep, to understand why it did not and learn something new about product usage in the real world.

After each project, their product understanding deepens, and they start to develop better and better product instincts. The next time, they'll bring even more relevant suggestions to the table. Over time, they become a goto person for product managers, their advice being sought well before projects are kicked off. They build a strong reputation outside the team, opening more doors for their continued career growth.

Tips to become a more product-minded engineer
---------------------------------------------

If you work on a user-facing product, here are a few tips I've seen work well, to growing your product-minded muscle.

*   **Understand how and why your company is successful**. What is the business model? How is money made? What parts are most profitable, what parts of the company are expanding the most? Why? How does your team fit into all of this?
*   **Build a strong relationship with your product manager**. Most product managers jump on the opportunity to mentor engineers. Having engineers be interested in product means they can scale themselves more. Before coming in, asking a lot of product questions, take time to build this relationship and make it clear to your product manager, that you'd like to get more involved in product topics.
*   **Engage in user research, customer support**, and other activities, where you can learn more about how the product works. Pair with designers, UX people, data scientists, operations people and others, who frequently interact with users.
*   **Bring well-backed product suggestions to the table.** After you have a good understanding of the business, the product and stakeholders: take initiative. You could bring small suggestions to a project you are working on. Or you could suggest a larger effort, outlining the engineering effort and the product effort, making this easy to prioritize in the backlog.
*   **Offer product/engineering tradeoffs** for the projects you work on. Think of not only making engineering tradeoffs for the product feature your team is building but suggest product tradeoffs that result in less engineering effort. Be open to the feedback on these from others.
*   **Ask for frequent feedback from your product manager.** Being a great product-minded engineer means you have built up good product skills, on top of your existing engineering skillset. The best person to give you feedback on how you're doing on the product skillset is your product manager. Reach out for feedback on how valuable they see your product suggestions and ask for thoughts on areas for further growth.

## 核心词汇

### minded

我们一般会在 minded 前面加一个形容词或名词，用连字符连接，通过连用构成复合形容词，表示“具有某种（前面形容词定义的）思维（或态度、性格）”。

The United States is a sports-minded country, with millions of fans who follow football, baseball, basketball and hockey, among other sports.

例句：Two dozen states have asked the D.C. Circuit to block a new climate-change-minded federal law that they say will inflate electricity bills for families.

例句：They are business-minded yet warm-hearted when it comes to those less fortunate, and prove that they can transform their theoretical academic knowledge into sustainable business practices through social projects.

### proactive

我们先来看这段话的标题中的一个词 proactive，它的意思是“积极、主动的”，它的反义词是 reactive，“消极、被动的”。

例句：The difference between proactive people and reactive people is that proactive people take initiative, and they come up with ideas to get things done despite the conditions they are in. Reactive people, on the other hand, usually are the ones to react to a situation rather than take initiative to create a situation.

如果你是程序员的话，讲到 reactive，相信你肯定很熟悉。你是不是想到了 reactive programming？对，就是响应式编程。

Pro- 和 Re- 这一对反义前缀，能够帮助我们更好地理解和记忆其他单词。例如 progress（前进、进化）和 regress（后退、退化）。它们的英语解释如下：

Progress is to move, go, or proceed forward; to advance.

Regress is to move backwards to an earlier stage; to devolve.

### settle for / settle

settle for (something):

to accept something less ideal or worse than what one really wanted;

to agree to accept something (even though something else would be better);

accept or be satisfied with as a compromise.

简单来说，settle for 就是“勉强同意接受，将就或者凑合”的意思。

例句：He demanded a bigger raise but decided to settle for what they offered.

例句：I could never settle for such a quiet life; I want excitement.

同样，settle 这个动词有“停留、安顿”的含义，也可以衍生出“将就、凑合、妥协”的意思。苹果公司创始人乔布斯在他著名的[斯坦福大学毕业典礼演讲](https://tech.qq.com/a/20111006/000132.htm)中就有这么一段，你可以感受一下：

And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on.  So keep looking until you find it. Don’t settle.

在这段话里，乔帮主两次提到“Don’t settle”，就是让我们跟随自己的内心，去寻找我们倾心的工作或爱情，找到了，你的心会告诉你，往后的日子历久弥新会越来越好；还没找到的话，千万不要放弃，不要妥协，不可以将就和凑合。

### specification

specification 这个词比较长，有时候我们在口语中直接说 spec 就可达意。如下文的英文解释，在工程中，指的是“设计说明书、设计规范”的意思：a detailed description of the design and materials used to make something.

### jump to

jump to (something) 这个短语，顾名思义是“匆匆忙忙、很快，甚至有些草率”的意思。意思很简单，我们重点来看它的三种用法及对应的例句。

第一种用法：jump to conclusions: to guess the facts about a situation without having enough information.

例句：Don’t jump to conclusions! Perhaps it was his daughter he was dancing with.

翻译：别匆忙下结论，和他跳舞的没准是他女儿呢。

第二种用法：jump to it (informal): used to tell someone to do something quickly.

例句：I told you to tidy this room - now jump to it!

翻译：（俚语）早就让你打扫房间，怎么还这样乱！快去！

第三种用法：jump to sb’s defence: to quickly defend someone.

例句：Whenever anyone criticizes her husband, she immediately jumps to his defence.

翻译：每当有人批评她的丈夫时，她会立即为他辩护。

### approach

这一段出现了两次 approach，分别有不同的意思。第一处是动词，意思是“找（某人）谈话、与（某人）打交道”，第二处是名词，意思是“（处理）方法”。这些都是最早从 to go or come near in place or in time 或者 come near in quality or character, resemble, become similar 等含义中衍生出来的意思。

例句：The workers approached the manager with a request for shorter working hours.翻译：工人们找经理要求减少工作时间。

例句：Those officials were approached with bribes.翻译：这些官员是被贿赂买通的。

在特定语境中，approach a government officer 本身就有企图贿赂政府官员的意思。

例句：His sober approach to the crisis averted a catastrophe.翻译：他对危机的冷静处理避免了一场大灾难。

### thin air

nowhere to be found in a giant void；nihility; nothingness; nullity; void; the state of nonexistence。

例句：You need to work hard—opportunities don’t just come out of thin air.翻译：你得努力啦，机会不会凭空产生 / 天上不会掉馅饼。

例句：The magician pulled a bouquet of flowers out of thin air.翻译：魔术师妙手空空变出一捧花来。

例句：With her children almost grown up, she found herself having to conjure a career from thin air.翻译：孩子们都快长大了，她发现自己需要凭空变出个工作来。

我们可以看到，和 thin air 搭配的介词，通常是 out of 或者 from。

### fit in

fit in 的第一个意思是“融入”，英文解释是：To become assimilated into and accepted by a group。

例句：I just don’t fit in with any of the kids at my new school.翻译：我和新学校的小孩们都合不来。

fit in 的第二个意思是“适合”，英文解释是：To blend or work harmoniously with something。

例句：Working in a research lab really fits in with my shy personality.翻译：在科研实验室工作非常适合我腼腆的性格。

### empathy 和 sympathy

empathy 表示“感同身受”，它的英文解释是：an individual’s ability to understand what another person is going through, by perceiving himself in the same situation，指一个人通过把自己放到相同的情境中感知自己，来理解另一个人正在经历的事情的能力。而有时候我们说“共情”，是强调“理解、共鸣”的意思。你可以通过下面这个例句再感受一下。

例句：He is empathetic with the jobless youth, as he was also struggling for a job in his early years.翻译：他对失业的年轻人感同身受，因为他自己早年也为找工作挣扎过。

而 Sympathy 表示“同情”，它的英文解释是：the feeling of sorrow for the hardships, problems and pain caused to another person，指“对另一个人造成的困难、问题和痛苦感到悲伤或怜悯”，更强调“同情、悲悯”。

例句：All Tony’s friends joined in sending their sympathies to his widow Jean.翻译：托尼的所有朋友都向他的遗孀琼表示了同情。

请用搜索引擎（推荐使用 www.bing.com 的海外版）查找“sympathy card”，了解英文“慰问卡”的一些写作方法，摘抄一些你认为以后可能会用得到的句子。

https://www.shutterfly.com/ideas/what-to-write-sympathy-cards/

in darkness sometimes all you need to be reminded of is a little light.

When you speak of him, speak not with tears, for thoughts of him should not be sad. Let memories of the times you shared give you comfort, for his life was rich because of you.

He didn’t tell me how to live; he lived, and let me watch him do it. What an amazing life your father led. I will never forget the way he smiled and the way he loved you with every piece of his heart.

If the bond between two people is strong, even death cannot do them apart.

What beautiful memories the two of you have mad together. I can’t imagine the loss you have suffered, but know I’m here for you now and always.

When the person you love has gone away, remember you always have their memories with you. It is something that no one can take away from you. We are thinking of you during this sad time.

Wishing you peace to bring you comfort, courage to face the days ahead and loving memories to forever hold in your heart.

最后：

Don’t use harsh words like ‘Death’, ‘Died’ or similar.

Avoid saying: “I know you feel”, “This happened for a reason”, “He/She was so young"

### dive

dive 的本意是“跳水”，就是头和两臂先入水的那种，plunge head first into water。它也可以指“鱼类、潜水艇或人类，借助呼吸设备潜水到更深的水下，(of a fish, a submarine, or a vessel used for underwater exploration) go to a deeper level in water (using breathing equipment)。

例句：The fish dive down to about 1,400 feet and then swim southwest.翻译：那条鱼潜到大约 1400 英尺的深度，然后向西南方向游去。

除此之外，dive 还可以指“飞机或鸟类在空中俯冲”，(of an aircraft or bird) plunge steeply downward through the air。

例句：The aircraft dove for the ground to avoid the attack.翻译：飞机向地面俯冲以躲避攻击。

在此基础上，我们可以通过“一头扎进去”这个意思，进一步引申出“立即开始采取行动、深入分析研究”等含义。例如本段话里的 dive to，就有程序员“立刻开始深入挖掘数据”的意思。比较常见的搭配还有 deep dive。

例句：Although this article does not provide a deep dive into the programming language, some Objective-C fundamentals are provided below.翻译：尽管本文没有深入介绍编程语言，但是下面提供了一些 Objective-C 的基础知识。

例句：Each article will dive deep into these concepts, with lots of detail and source code.翻译：每篇文章都将深入探讨这些概念，包括大量细节和源代码。

### (user) metrics

software metrics 即“软件测量 / 度量”，有时候也叫 software measurements。要想真正跳脱出软件开发的暗箱，除了定性评估以外，还需要一系列基于数值的度量指标来进行测评。同样道理，对于一个产品的用户体验，也有相应的用户测量指标。

例句：Software metrics are numerical ratings to measure the complexity and reliability of source code, the length and quality of the development process and the performance of the application when completed.翻译：软件度量使用数值评级来衡量源代码的复杂性和可靠性、开发过程的长度和质量以及应用程序完成后的性能。

例句：Social media technologies have given companies access to an unprecedented flood of new analytics, metrics and user data.翻译：有了社交网络之后，企业获取了空前大量的新分析方法、度量指标和用户数据。
