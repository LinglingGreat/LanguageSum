**On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages alongshore, the world and its mistress returned to Gatsby’s house and twinkled hilariously on his lawn.**

> ==twinkle vi. 闪烁 (舞蹈者的双脚)轻快地移动==
>
> ==hilarious adj. 十分有趣的, 非常滑稽的 欢闹的==

**“He’s a bootlegger,” said the young ladies, moving somewhere between his cocktails and his flowers.**

**“One time he killed a man who had found out that he was nephew to Von Hindenburg and second cousin to the devil.**

**Reach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there crystal glass.”**

**Once I wrote down on the empty spaces of a time-table the names of those who came to Gatsby’s house that summer.**

**It is an old time-table now, disintegrating at its folds, and headed “This schedule in effect July 5th, 1922.”**

**But I can still read the gray names, and they will give you a better impression than my generalities of those who accepted Gatsby’s hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing whatever about him.**

> ==hospitality英 [ˌhɒspɪˈtæləti] 美 [ˌhɑ:spɪˈtæləti] n. 殷勤好客；招待==
>
> <font color=red>But I can still read the gray names, / and they will give you a better impression / than my generalities / of those who accepted Gatsby’s hospitality / and paid him the subtle tribute / of knowing nothing / whatever about him.</font>
>
> 但我还认得出那些暗淡的名字，它们可以给你一个比我的笼统概括更清楚的印象，那些人到盖茨比家里做客，却对他一无所知，仿佛这是对他所表示的一种微妙的敬意。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing whatever about him 在这里是一种讽刺，pay tribute to sb也就是“向某人表示敬意”，但为什么“对Gatsby的事情一点都不了解”可以成为一种敬意呢？这里有两种解释：
>
> 首先因为Gatsby本人并不希望别人对他知道得太多，从他小心保护自己的名声以及刻意和他人保持距离就可以看出来。所以宾客们不去打探他的隐私（或是装作什么都不知道）就是对他的一种尊重，subtle tribute理解为a secret, acquiescent tribute（秘密的、默许的致敬）。
>
> 其次这里也可以看成一种讽刺，宾客们并不是真的要像Gatsby致敬，他们对Gatsby一无所知仅仅是因为他们只关心这个殷情的主人十分大方阔绰，利用这一点他们可以无所顾忌地在她的派对上狂欢。所以这里subtle tribute可以理解为nearly a tribute（勉强可以称作“致敬”）。

**From East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches, and a man named Bunsen, whom I knew at Yale, and Doctor Webster Civet, who was drowned last summer up in Maine.**

**And the Hornbeams and the Willie Voltaires, and a whole clan named Blackbuck, who always gathered in a corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near.**

**And the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and Mr. Chrystie’s wife), and Edgar Beaver, whose hair, they say, turned cotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.**

**Clarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember.**

**He came only once, in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the garden.**

**From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O. R. P. Schraeders, and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia, and the Fishguards and the Ripley Snells.**

**Snell was there three days before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel drive that Mrs. Ulysses Swett’s automobile ran over his right hand.**

> ==penitentiary n. <美>监狱 adj. 用作教养的,感化(院)的,教养所的==

**The Dancies came, too, and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over sixty, and Maurice A. Flink, and the Hammerheads, and Beluga the tobacco importer, and Beluga’s girls.**

**From West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Schoen and Gulick the state senator and NewtonOrchid,**

**who controlled Films Par Excellence, and Eckhaust and ClydeCohen and Don S. Schwartze (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the movies in one way or another.**

**And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G. Earl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his wife.**

**Da Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B. (“Rot-Gut.”) Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly —**

**they came to gamble, and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was cleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably next day.**

> ==fluctuate英 [ˈflʌktʃueɪt] 美 [ˈflʌktʃuˌet] vi. 波动；涨落 vt. 使波动；使动摇==

**A man named Klipspringer was there so often and so long that he became known as “the boarder.”— I doubt if he had any other home.**

**Of theatrical people there were Gus Waize and Horace O’donavan and Lester Meyer and George Duckweed and Francis Bull.**

**Also from New York were the Chromes and the Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and the Kellehersand the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and the Smirkes and the young Quinns,**

**divorced now, and Henry L. Palmetto, who killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train in Times Square.**

**Benny McClenahan arrived always with four girls.**

**They were never quite the same ones in physical person, but they were so identical one with another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before.**

**I have forgotten their names — Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela, or Gloria or Judy or June,**

**and their last names were either the melodious names of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American capitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves to be.**

> ==melodious英 [məˈləʊdiəs] 美 [məˈloʊdiəs] adj. 悠扬；悦耳的；有旋律的==
>
> <font color=red>I have forgotten their names / — Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela, or Gloria or Judy or June, / and their last names were / either the melodious names of flowers and months / or the sterner ones of the great American capitalists /whose cousins, if pressed, / they would confess themselves to be.</font>
>
> 她们的名字我忘了——杰奎林，大概是，要不然就是康雪爱拉，或者格洛丽亚或者珠迪或者琼，她们的姓要么是音调悦耳的花名和月份的名字，要么是美国大资本家的庄严的姓氏，只要有人追问，她们就会承认自己是他们的远亲。
>
> **💧句式拆解**
>
> ...whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves to be, if pressed省略了主谓they are, 和后面的they以及themselves都是指前面提到的那些女孩们。
>
> 这里我们可以把定语从句还原一下来帮助理解：if pressed, they would confess themselves to be the cousins of the great American capitalists.
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> 这个句子里面有两个词特别讽刺了这些女孩扭捏和虚荣之态：
>
> press表示to be questioned repeatedly（被反复追问），而confess一般指to admit something that one feels embarrassed or guilty about（承认令自己尴尬或愧疚的事情）。这些女孩当然不是真的因为不情愿而非要在别人的追问下才承认自己是某个名门望族的远亲，只是因为虚荣心使她们故作出矜持的样子。

**In addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O’Brien came there at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer, who had his nose shot off in the war,**

**and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag, his fiancee, and Ardita Fitz-Peters and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of the American Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip, with a man reputed to be her chauffeur, and a prince of something, whom we called Duke, and whose name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten.**

**All these people came to Gatsby’s house in the summer.**

**At nine o’clock, one morning late in July, Gatsby’s gorgeous car lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody from its three-noted horn.**

**It was the first time he had called on me, though I had gone to two of his parties, mounted in his hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation, made frequent use of his beach.**

> ==hydroplane英 [ˈhaɪdrəpleɪn] 美 [ˈhaɪdrəˌplen] n. 水上滑艇，水上飞机==

**“Good morning, old sport. You’re having lunch with me to-day and I thought we’d ride up together.”**

**He was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American —**

**that comes, I suppose, with the absence of lifting work or rigid sitting in youth and, even more, with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games.**

> ==dashboard英 [ˈdæʃbɔ:d] 美 [ˈdæʃbɔ:rd] n. 仪表板；仪表盘==
>
> ==peculiarly adv. 异常地;尤其地;单独地;独特地==
>
> ==sporadic adj. 零星的；分散的；不定时发生的==
>
> <font color=red>He was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car / with that resourcefulness of movement / that is so peculiarly American — / that comes, / I suppose, / with the absence of lifting work or rigid sitting in youth / and, even more, / with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games.</font>
>
> 他站在他车子的挡泥板上，保持着身体的平衡，那种灵活的动作是美国人所特有的——我想这是由于年轻时候不干重活的缘故，更重要的是由于我们各种紧张剧烈的运动练就了一种姿势的自然而优美。
>
> **💧句式拆解**
>
> 注意that is so peculiarly American以及破折号后面的that comes with...and with..都是修饰that resourcefulness of movement的定语从句哦~
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①resourcefulness of movement, resourceful表示“足智多谋的，机智的”，这里形容肢体动作很灵活；
>
> ②with the absence of lifting work or rigid sitting in youth, lifting work指“力气活，重活”，rigid sitting指“僵硬的坐姿”（rigid即stiff）；
>
> ③with the formless grace, formless可以理解为“不受约束的，恣意流露的”，grace在这里所指的优雅是一种ease and flexibility of movement (见Merriam-Webster)，所以formless grace实际上也在和上文的resourcefulness of movement相呼应；
>
> ④of our nervous, sporadic games, nervous表示“激烈的，紧张的”，sporadic原义是“不时发生的”（happening fairly often）, 这里应该是指类似美式橄榄球以及棒球这样有频繁暂停和开始的运动（sport games that stop and start）.
>
> *这一段话语言非常隐晦，有多种解释的可能，这里提供大家一个思路参考：“肢体灵活”以及“姿态任意不受约束”都在暗指当时美国的一种安逸富足的文化，和战时严持戒律的紧张状态不同，人在身体上和思想上都更为放松。而且有了更多的休闲娱乐的时间，包括进行各种运动，浑身上下充满了无处安放的能量和活力（比如下文还提到了Gatsby似乎总是不安分：never quite still）.

**This quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness.**

> ==punctilious adj. 拘礼的,拘谨的==

**He was never quite still; there was always a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.**

**He saw me looking with admiration at his car.**

**“It’s pretty, isn’t it, old sport?”**

**He jumped off to give me a better view.**

**“Haven’t you ever seen it before?”**

**I’d seen it. Everybody had seen it.**

**It was a rich cream color, bright with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hat-boxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and terraced with a labyrinth of wind-shields that mirrored a dozen suns.**

> ==labyrinth英[ˈlæbərɪnθ] 美[ˈlæbəˌrɪnθ] n. 迷宫； （文字，建筑，事件） 错综复杂； 难解的事件==
>
> <font color=red>It was a rich cream color, / bright with nickel, /swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hat-boxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, / and terraced with a labyrinth of wind-shields that mirrored a dozen suns.</font>
>
> 车子是瑰丽的奶油色的，镀镍的地方闪光耀眼，车身长得出奇，四处鼓出帽子盒、大饭盒和工具盒，琳琅满目，还有层层叠叠的挡风玻璃反映出十来个太阳的光辉。
>
> **💧句式拆解**
>
> 这句话虽然很长，但包含主谓的主体部分非常短 ，也就是It was a rich cream color. 其余的都属于修饰性部分：bright with nickel是形容词短语；swollen...with以及and terraced with...是两个过去分词短语结构。
>
> 💧表达精讲
>
> ① swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hat-boxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, in its monstrous length是副词性插入结构，表示“奇长无比”；triumphant是拟人的用法，表示“得意洋洋的，明目张胆的”；hat-boxs, supper-boxes, tool-boxes在这里都是比喻的说法，指车的顶部、车头盖、车灯等地方突起的幅度就像一个个盒子扣在车子上一样。
>
> ②terraced with a labyrinth of wind-shields that mirrored a dozen suns, terraced表示“成阶梯状的”；a labyrinth of表示“（形状）错综复杂的”，labyrinth本身有“迷宫”的意思；mirrored a dozen suns当然也是夸张的说法，这里是强调挡风玻璃非常光亮刺眼。
>
> *这一段虽然大花笔墨来描写Gatsby的豪车，但其实也在侧面刻画Gatsby的人物形象：swollen, monstrous, triumphant, labyrinth这些词都在暗示一种招摇卖弄的（ostentatious）气派，说明Gatsby极力想要展现自己的阔绰和富裕，而且自信心极为膨胀。

**Sitting down behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory, we started to town.**

> ==conservatory n. (培植植物的)温室,暖房==

**I had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and found, to my disappointment, that he had little to say:**

**So my first impression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate road-house next door.**

**And then came that disconcerting ride.**

> ==proprietor n. 所有人,业主==
>
> ==disconcerting adj. 困惑的, 不安的, 尴尬的==

**We hadn’t reached West Egg village before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-colored suit.**

**“Look here, old sport,” he broke out surprisingly.**

**“What’s your opinion of me, anyhow?”**

**A little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which that question deserves.**

**“Well, I’m going to tell you something about my life,” he interrupted.**

**“I don’t want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear.”**

**So he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavored conversation in his halls.**

> ==flavor==
>
> vt. 给…添风味[添情趣，添风趣]；给…调味
>
> 原文：So he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavored conversation in his halls.
>
> 原来他知道那些给他客厅里的谈话增添风趣的离奇的流言蜚语。
>
> 💧flavor作动词的原义是“给 (食物或饮料) 调味”，这里可以理解为“给……增添风趣的内容”。类似用法的词还有season. 
>
> 💧比如：Season the chicken with pepper.
>
> 给鸡肉加胡椒粉调味。

**“I’ll tell you God’s truth.” His right hand suddenly ordered divine retribution to stand by.**

**“I am the son of some wealthy people in the Middle West — all dead now.**

**I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford, because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It is a family tradition.”**

**He looked at me sideways — and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he was lying.**

**He hurried the phrase “educated at Oxford,” or swallowed it, or choked on it, as though it had bothered him before.**

**And with this doubt, his whole statement fell to pieces, and I wondered if there wasn’t something a little sinister about him, after all.**

**“What part of the Middle West?” I inquired casually.**

**“San Francisco.” “I see.”**

**“My family all died and I came into a good deal of money.”**

**His voice was solemn, as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan still haunted him.**

**For a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg, but a glance at him convinced me otherwise.**

**“After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of Europe — Paris, Venice, Rome — collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago.”**

**With an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter.**

> ==incredulous adj. 表示怀疑的, 不相信的==

**The very phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that of a turbaned “character” leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne.**

> ==threadbare英[ˈθredbeə(r)] 美[ˈθredber] adj. 陈旧的； （衣服等） 穿旧的==
>
> adj. 陈旧的;（衣服等）穿旧的
>
> 原文：The very phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that...
>
> 他的措词本身那么陈腐，以致在我脑子里只能是这样的形象……
>
> 💧threadbare本义指“衣服破旧的”（长期磨损后衣服的针线都露出来了：thread线+bare裸露的），引申为“（想法，观点）陈旧的，无趣的”，相当于clichéd. 
>
> 💧比如：a mystery novel with a threadbare plot 一本情节老套的悬疑小说

### 背景知识

**💧1. Worship 礼拜**

星期天早晨，教堂的钟声响彻沿岸村镇的时候（On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages alongshore.）时髦社会的男男女女又回到了盖茨比的别墅，在他的草坪上寻欢作乐。

礼拜日又被称作“安息日”，基督教徒于这一天前往教堂做礼拜。这些年轻时髦的男女不去教堂，而去盖茨比的别墅，可见他们不是虔诚的教徒，或者并无信仰。

礼拜来源于《圣经》中的安息日。上帝六天创造天地，第七天安息 。于是赐福给第七天，并告诫他的子民把安息日守为圣日。

在基督教中，礼拜仪式是一种正式的集体礼拜，通常在周日或周六。基督徒聚集在一起，被教导“神的话语”（Word of God）（也就是《圣经》），同时坚固自己的信仰。

**💧2. San Francisco  旧金山**

"中西部什么地方？"我随便一问。 "旧金山。"（“What part of the Middle West?” I inquired casually. “San Francisco.”）盖茨比说他出身于中西部，然而“我”随口一问他就露馅了，旧金山并不是美国中西部的城市。

旧金山（San Francisco），又译“圣弗朗西斯科”、“三藩市”，美国加利福尼亚州太平洋沿岸的港口城市，是世界著名旅游胜地、加州人口第四大城市。

19世纪这里是美国淘金热的中心地区，早期华人劳工移居美国后多居住于此，称之为“金山”。但直到在澳大利亚的墨尔本发现金矿后，为了与被称作“新金山”的墨尔本做出区别，而改称圣弗朗西斯科为“旧金山”。

旧金山属亚热带地中海气候，拥有享誉世界的旧金山湾区、金门大桥（Golden Gate Bridge）和渔人码头（Fisherman's Wharf），气候冬暖夏凉、阳光充足，临近众多美国国家公园（如约塞米蒂国家公园Yosemite National Park）和加州葡萄酒产地纳帕谷，被誉为“最受美国人欢迎的城市”。

### 课文理解

Nick翻出了去年夏天记下的来参加Gatsby聚会的人员名单，并且不遗余力地把他们都描述了一番。当然这些大都是有头有脸的人物，其中很多细节的刻画也非常传神——



💧**Clue 1**: All Gatsby's parties were attended by the rich and glamorous.

**Evidence 1**:And the Hornbeams and the Willie Voltaires, and a whole clan named Blackbuck, who always gathered in a corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near.

还有霍恩比姆夫妇、威利·伏尔泰夫妇以及布莱克巴克全家，他们总是聚集在一个角落里，不管谁走近，他们都会像山羊一样翘起鼻孔。

有意思的是Blackbuck这一大家子人（a whole clan）, 在派对上他们就像一个小团体在一起（always gathered in a corner）, 不屑于和别人套近乎，很是自视清高。flipped up their noses likegoats这个动作也是一种优越感的表现（to show superiority）. 读到这里，大家有没有想起Nick曾经也把Tom和Daisy描述为“仿佛属于一个秘密团体”（a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged） 呢？

**Evidence 2**: Da Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B. (“Rot-Gut.”) Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly — they came to gamble, and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was cleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably next day.

投资商达·冯坦诺也来这儿，还有爱德·莱格罗、詹姆斯·B·（外号是"坏酒"）菲来特、德·琼大妇和欧内斯特·利里——他们都是来赌钱的，每当菲来特逛进花园里去，那就意味着他输得精光，第二天联合运输公司的股票又得涨一番。

这里Nick讽刺了股票市场其实也不过是富人操纵的棋盘（Ferret要是把钱输光了，第二天他的公司的股票价格就得上涨）。fluctuate profitably其实就是指“价格上涨”，但这样表达非常隐晦：fluctuate表示“上下浮动”，profitably则是暗示“有利可图地，朝有利的方向”。profitably也在暗指这些公司的上层人物只一味寻求自身利益的满足。



💧**Clue 2**: Gatsby is eager to leave a favorable impression on Nick.

**Evidence 1**: “Well, I’m going to tell you something about my life,” he interrupted. “I don’t want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear.

"得啦，我来给你讲讲我自己的身世吧，"他打断了我的话。"你听到这么多闲话，我不希望你从中得到一个对我的错误看法。"

Gatsby显然知道关于他的那些风言风语，但在前文里表现得异常漠不关心的他，现在却主动地向Nick解释，希望他不要产生任何的误会。在这个过程中，他虽然努力想说明清楚，但又不时地露出一些让Nick啼笑皆非的“马脚”（比如他把旧金山说成是在美国的中西部），而且在提到自己的学历时吞吞吐吐，一副难以言喻的样子——

**Evidence 2**: He hurried the phrase “educated at Oxford,” or swallowed it, or choked on it, as though it had bothered him before.

把“在牛津受的教育”这句话匆匆带了过去，或者含糊其词，或者半吞半吐，仿佛这句话以前就使他犯嘀咕。

至此，因为Gatsby漏洞百出的自我陈述，Nick对他依旧抱有很大的怀疑。但也正是因为Gatsby身上自始至终的一种令人困惑又迷人的气质激起了Nick的好奇心，在之后的情节里我们会慢慢看到Nick态度的转变~

### 今日彩蛋

**💧1920s Western Fashion Clothing**  

**20世纪20年代西方服饰风尚**

克拉伦斯·恩狄只来过一次，穿着一条白灯笼裤，还在花园里跟一个姓艾蒂的二流子干了一架。（He came only once, in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the garden.）

白灯笼裤大概是个什么样式？那时候的美国人民都怎么穿呢？今天我们来看看20世纪20年代的西方服饰风尚~

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/9ce1a96d64b434dddacef3c13623ed3e-sz_133778.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



\1. Menswear  男装

在男装领域，20世纪20年代有两个截然不同的时期。在20世纪20年代早期，男性短西装外套（short suit jackets）时尚的特点是高腰夹克，经常搭配皮带，西装外套的翻领不是很宽。这种款式的夹克似乎很大程度上受到了第一次世界大战期间军队所穿制服的影响。裤子比较窄，比较直，穿得很短，男人的袜子常常露出来。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/a62269352a818ce31e33873ca6bd814f-sz_35607.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



到1925年，牛津裤（Oxford bag）开始流行起来。在20世纪20年代后期，双排扣背心，经常搭配单排扣夹克，也变得相当时尚。

在20世纪20年代，男人有各种各样的运动服装可供选择，包括毛衣和短裤short trousers（在美式英语中通常被称为灯笼裤knickers）. 

在白天的正式场合，通常要穿晨装。晚装的话，男士偏爱短礼服（short tuxedo）胜过燕尾服（tail coat）.



\2. Women's Evening Wear 女性的晚装

音乐本身对新青年社会有相当大的吸引力，由于其自发性被认为是20世纪20年代的脉搏（pulse）. 随着新的音乐出现了新的舞蹈。

爵士舞，如查尔斯顿舞（the Charleston），取代了慢华尔兹舞（slow waltz）. Paul Whitman使爵士乐流行起来。事实上，爵士音乐和舞蹈是flapper的起源。

当舞者跳查尔斯顿舞时，脚的快速移动和手臂的摆动就像鸟儿拍打翅膀的动作。像查尔斯顿舞和黑底舞（Black Bottom）这样的舞蹈特别需要女性晚装的复兴，因为爵士舞充满活力。

女性裙子的裙边变得更短，以便让身体更容易移动。此外，裙子上的装饰也富有变化，如条纹装饰，随着身体的运动摆动叮当作响。所以，爵士乐的节奏和舞蹈使得更多有光泽的和华丽的纺织品被用做晚装材料。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/a8bb8f38d20736d1942b851619b7e4fd-sz_31722.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



\3. The boyish figure  中性风貌

在第一次世界大战后，内衣（undergarments ）开始发生变化，符合女生想要变得胸部更平、身材更男孩子气的理想。女性的身材从紧身衣中解放出来，最流行的男孩的外观是通过使用胸衣来实现的。

一些新款式包括衬衫（chemises）、薄的贴身背心和后来的cami-knickers. 这些衣服主要是用人造丝（rayon）做的，颜色柔和，以便穿在半透明的布料下。

年轻的乐迷们之所以喜欢这种风格的下装，是因为他们可以更自由地活动，而且随着快节奏的爵士音乐起舞时也更舒适。在20世纪20年代中期，多功能内衣（all-in-one lingerie）开始流行。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/7b90185a666fbb80f8198869f93191ef-sz_202405.png)



第一个穿裤子、剪短发、不穿紧身胸衣的女性是可可·香奈儿。可可·香奈儿（Coco Chanel）可能是20世纪最具影响力的时尚女性，她为女性时尚的解放和自由做出了巨大贡献。

此时再看20世纪20年代西方的服饰真是既复古又大气，其中有你喜欢的穿搭风格吗？

**“— So I took one look at him,” said Mr. Wolfsheim, shaking my hand earnestly, “and what do you think I did?”**

**“I handed the money to Katspaugh and I said: ‘all right, Katspaugh, don’t pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.’ He shut it then and there.”**

**Gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the restaurant, whereupon Mr. Wolfsheim swallowed a new sentence he was starting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction.**

**“Highballs?” asked the head waiter.**

**“This is a nice restaurant here,” said Mr. Wolfsheim, looking at the Presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling.**

**“But I like across the street better!”**

**“Yes, highballs,” agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfsheim: “It’s too hot over there.”**

**“Hot and small — yes,” said Mr. Wolfsheim, “but full of memories.”**

**“What place is that?” I asked.**

**“The old Metropole.”**

**“The old Metropole,” brooded Mr. Wolfsheim gloomily.**

**“Filled with faces dead and gone.**

**Filled with friends gone now forever.**

**I can’t forget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there.**

**It was six of us at the table, and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening.**

**‘All right,’ says Rosy, and begins to get up, and I pulled him down in his chair.**

**“‘Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don’t you, so help me, move outside this room.’**

**“It was four o’clock in the morning then, and if we’d of raised the blinds we’d of seen daylight.”**

**“Did he go?” I asked innocently.**

**“Sure he went.” Mr. Wolfsheim’s nose flashed at me indignantly.**

**“He turned around in the door and says: ‘Don’t let that waiter take away my coffee!’ Then he went out on the sidewalk, and they shot him three times in his full belly and drove away.”**

**“Four of them were electrocuted,” I said, remembering.**

### 背景知识

**💧1. Hotel Metropole and Rosey Rosenthal**

“The old Metropole,” brooded Mr. Wolfsheim gloomily. “Filled with faces dead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever. I can’t forget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there...”

"老大都会，"沃尔夫山姆先生闷闷不乐地回忆道，"那里聚集过多少早已消逝的面容，聚集过多少如今已经不在人间的朋友。我只要活着就不会忘记他们开枪打死罗西·罗森塔尔的那个晚上。"

大都会酒店是纽约市第一家每个房间都用自来水的酒店。酒店位于时代广场附近的西43街147号，现在被称为“卡萨布兰卡时代广场酒店”(Casablanca hotel Times Square)，住过很多名人，包括Nick Arnstein（美国飞艇设计及制造家）和Bat Masterson（知名体育新闻记者）。

1912年7月16日凌晨，Herman Rosenthal被谋杀的地点就在该酒店。Rosenthal是纽约几个赌场的老板。据称，这起谋杀案是在Charles Becker的授意下进行的。Becker是纽约的一名警探，1915年因这起谋杀案被处决。

James Thurber在1991年出版的Robert Lopresti编辑的《瑟伯论犯罪》*(Thurber on Crime*)一书中，就这个问题写了一篇文章，名为《凌晨两点的大都会》(*Two O’clock at the Metropole*).

大都会酒店后来更名为罗索夫酒店(Hotel Rosoff)，现在是卡萨布兰卡酒店(Casablanca Hotel).



**💧2. Trinity College, Oxford  牛津大学三一学院**

这是在三一学院校园里照的——我左边那个人现在是唐卡斯特伯爵。（It was taken in Trinity Quad — the man on my left is now the Earl of Dorcaster.）

盖茨比拿出了在牛津三一学院拍的照片，这让他的经历看起来又像是真的了。

三一学院（The College of the Holy and Undivided Trinity in the University of Oxford），是英国牛津大学的组成学院之一。该学院由Sir Thomas Pope于1555年创建，位于杜伦学院（Durham College）之前的土地上，在英国牛津的Broad Street，介于牛津大学贝利奥尔学院（Balliol College）和布莱克韦尔书店（Blackwell's bookshop）之间，Turl Street对面。

三一学院培养了三名英国首相，与贝利奥尔学院并列第二。校园周围是铁栅栏而不是围墙，学院的独特的蓝色大门，使其在外观上比牛津大学其他学院更加开放。尽管学校规模庞大，但学生人数相对较少，约有400人。原是一所男子学院，自1979年开始男女同校。

### 课文理解

Gatsby关于自己身世和来历的叙述让Nick感觉半真半假，但这都不影响他对Gatsby依旧有着强烈的好奇心。在今天的内容中，我们也得到了关于Gatsby的更多线索，不仅来源于Nick的隐喻性描绘，还有他们和Gatsby的朋友Mr. Wolfshiem的碰面都透露了不少细节。首先，Nick把Gatsby形容为一个创造可能性的人——

💧**Clue 1**:  Gatsby is exactly the man who creates possibilities.

**Evidence 1**: “Anything can happen now that we’ve slid over this bridge,” I thought; “anything at all. . . . ” Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.

"我们现在一过这座桥，什么事都可能发生了，"我心里想，"无论什么事都会有……" 因此，连盖茨比这种人物也是会出现的，这用不着大惊小怪。

这句话强调了两点：首先是“任何事情都可以发生，甚至像Gatsby这样的”，暗示了Gatsby的矛盾性和不同寻常之处；其次是我们通常只会说一个人exist，而不会用happen这个词。“发生”通常是指事件，会带来一定的影响和结果。因此这里暗示Gatsby之后的一切行为都将带来不可预测的后果（尽管可能是暂时的）。



💧**Clue 2**:  Gatsby is actually engaged in illegal business.

我们在前面的内容里读到了不少关于Gatsby的负面猜测，在昨天Chapter 4的开头，还提到了有很多女士讨论说Gatsby是做走私酒生意的：“He’s a bootlegger,” said the young ladies. bootlegger特指1920s这个时期从事非法制作、进口、销售酒类的人（people who illegally made, imported, or sold alcohol during this time），而非法的背景就是基于当时全国实行的禁酒令（Prohibition）. 虽然Nick并没有直接肯定这一点，但有两个细节都在暗指这个是事实。

**Evidence 1**: “Hot and small — yes,” said Mr. Wolfsheim, “but full of memories.”“What place is that?” I asked. “The old Metropole.”

"又热又小——不错，"沃尔夫山姆先生说，"可是充满了回忆。" "那是哪一家饭店？"我问。"老大都会。"

我们在背景里面已经介绍过，大都会酒店在当时的纽约是一个犯罪场所的聚集地，比如下文提到的那起谋杀案就发生在这里。从Mr. Wolfsheim的口吻也不难读出，他本身很有可能就是混黑社会的（a member of the underworld）. 而Gatsby会和他成为朋友，恐怕也是因为有一定时间的合作关系了。

**Evidence 2**:“Five, with Becker.” His nostrils turned to me in an interested way. “I understand you’re looking for a business gonnegtion.” The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered for me: “Oh, no,” he exclaimed, “this isn’t the man.”

"五个，连贝克在内。"他鼻孔转向我，带着对我感兴趣的神情，"我听说你在找一个做生意的伙伴。" 这两句话连在一起使人听了震惊。盖茨比替我回答："啊，不是，"他大声说，"这不是那个人。"

*gonnegtion即connection

Mr. Wolfsheim误把Nick当成Gatsby找到的一个生意伙伴，结果Gatsby匆忙否认。为什么Gatsby会这么紧张呢？我们看上一句，The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling指的是Mr. Wolfsheim刚说完之前那起谋杀案一共抓了五个人，下一句就提到Gatsby在找生意伙伴，这两句话连在一起极容易让人产生不好的联想。但换一个角度来看，startling还包含另一层含义：Gatsby的确就在从事非法商业活动，而Mr. Wolfsheim阴差阳错地差点泄露了这件事，让Nick也不禁替Gatsby倒吸一口冷气。

这种人物的矛盾性和模糊感可以说是Fitzegerald的刻意为之，同时也是当时浮华的美国梦的一个缩影，光鲜和阴暗两面并存，让人困惑的同时又为其着迷。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****1920s Afternoon Tea and Tea Dresses**

**1920年代上层社会的饮茶风尚**

"不，今天下午。我碰巧打听到你约了贝克小姐喝茶。"（“No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you’re taking Miss Baker to tea.”）尼克约了贝克小姐喝茶，而不是喝咖啡或是其他活动，可见当时饮茶在上层社会非常风行。

大约在9世纪，往来于欧洲和东方的商人、传教士和探险家开始接触中国和日本萌芽中的茶传统。阿拉伯贸易文件中提到的是煮苦茶叶的过程。后来，马可·波罗（Marco Polo）在他关于东方的游记中提到他发现了茶。

然而，直到17世纪茶才在西方出现。一般认为是一位葡萄牙传教士在葡萄牙和中国之间的商队间来回运送茶叶到欧洲的。大概在1610年，第一批日本和中国茶叶经由荷兰东印度公司（Dutch East India Company）由海路运抵欧洲。茶也通过从中国来的骆驼商队在著名的丝绸之路进入俄罗斯。

（茶马古道）



为了满足上流社会喝茶的时尚生活，英国东印度公司不辞艰辛地贩运起茶叶。在最初的几年里，东印度公司每年进口到英国的茶叶还保持在三位数，到了1690年，进口量已经猛增到近四万磅。

（An English Family at Tea, Joseph van Aken, 1720）



茶的流行迅速蔓延到阿姆斯特丹、巴黎和伦敦等城市，尽管其高昂的价格限制了皇室和贵族阶层的消费。饮茶在当时还是一种新奇的事物，在这个探索和发现的时代，它让富人们可以参与一些东方的冒险活动。

由于下午茶的盛行，也衍生出了下午茶的服饰。室内聚会则选择大多数适合季节的颜色。富裕家庭的礼服一般是优雅、轻盈，较多是白色的。搭配的是轻薄的透明丝袜，白色或类似的淡色。鞋子也可以是白色的高跟鞋，或者是T型带的中跟鞋。再加上一双白色棉质手套和一顶白色草帽，饰以白色花边。上层阶级穿纯白色的衣服，因为他们可以负担得起所有搭配的是饰品。

（1926 Young Miss Party Dresses）



对于中产阶级来说，选择一件可以搭配黑色皮靴、深色长筒袜和任何颜色帽子的彩色下午装是更好的选择。每个中产阶级女性的衣橱里都有一件半正式的（semi formal）下午茶礼服。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/5c62ca003852753957c92db3a3959351-sz_4055126.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmhigh)



原来饮茶在西方也是这样一种美的享受，气定神闲的你也来一杯吧~

**I think that, except for my presence,he would have taken one short glance beneath our own table.**

**“Look here, old sport,” said Gatsby, leaning toward me, “I’m afraid I made you a little angry this morning in the car.”**

**There was the smile again, but this time I held out against it.**

**“I don’t like mysteries,” I answered.**

**“And I don’t understand why you won’t come out frankly and tell me what you want. Why has it all got to come through Miss Baker?”**

**“Oh, it’s nothing underhand,” he assured me.**

**“Miss Baker’s a great sportswoman, you know, and she’d never do anything that wasn’t all right.”**

**Suddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up, and hurried from the room, leaving me with Mr. Wolfsheim at the table.**

**“I’ve heard of it.” “It’s one of the most famous colleges in the world.”**

**“Have you known Gatsby for a long time?” I inquired.**

**“Several years,” he answered in a gratified way.**

**“I made the pleasure of his acquaintance just after the war.**

**But I knew I had discovered a man of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour.**

**“I see you’re looking at my cuff buttons.”**

**I hadn’t been looking at them, but I did now.**

**They were composed of oddly familiar pieces of ivory.**

**“Finest specimens of human molars,” he informed me.**

**“Well!” I inspected them.**

**“That’s a very interesting idea.” “Yeah.”**

**He flipped his sleeves up under his coat.**

**“Yeah, Gatsby’s very careful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend’s wife.”**

**When the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat down Mr. Wolfsheim drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet.**

**“I have enjoyed my lunch,” he said, “and I’m going to run off from you two young men before I outstay my welcome.”**

**“Don’t hurry, Meyer,” said Gatsby, without enthusiasm.**

**Mr. Wolfsheim raised his hand in a sort of benediction.**

**“You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and your ——”**

**He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his hand.**

**“As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won’t impose myself on you any longer.”**

**I wondered if I had said anything to offend him.**

> ①sb is quite a character 也就是指 sb is really something, “是个不一般的人物”；

> ②a denizen of Broadway 从字面上理解是“长住在百老汇”；denizen指“〔特定地区的〕动物，植物，居民”，是文学性比较强的说法，其实就相当于habitant, resident.
>
> *这里并不是说Mr. Wolfshiem就“住”在百老汇，denizen是一个比喻的说法，有两层含义：一是他的活动/势力范围在百老汇；二是讽刺他有时候非常情绪化、多愁善感，因为百老汇是纽约的戏剧艺术中心，所以这里其实是暗讽Mr. Wolfshiem is a "Broadway" (dramatic) person.（结合上文说He becomes very sentimental sometimes以及This is one of his sentimental days）. 

**“Who is he, anyhow, an actor?”“No.”**

**“A dentist?” “Meyer Wolfsheim? No, he’s a gambler.”**

**Gatsby hesitated, then added coolly:“He’s the man who fixed the World’s Series back in 1919.”**

**“Fixed the World’s Series?” I repeated.**

**The idea staggered me.**

**I remembered, of course, that the World’s Series had been fixed in 1919, but if I had thought of it at all I would have thought of it as a thing that merely happened, the end of some inevitable chain.**

> ③with the single-mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe, with在这里表示方式，也就是“凭借，用”；single-mindedness 表示“决心，一门心思的想做成某事”（determination）；blowing a safe是现在分词短语作后置定语修饰a burglar, blow指“炸开，炸毁”（to shatter, burst, or destroy by explosion）；所以a burglar blowing a safe表示“试图把保险箱炸开的盗贼”（a burglar managing to blow a safe open）.

**“How did he happen to do that?” I asked after a minute.**

**“He just saw the opportunity.”**

**“Why isn’t he in jail?”**

**“They can’t get him, old sport. He’s a smart man.”**

**“This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.”**

**They shook hands briefly, and a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over Gatsby’s face.**

**“How’ve you been, anyhow?” demanded Tom of me.**

**“How’d you happen to come up this far to eat?”**

**“I’ve been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.”**

**I turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there.**

**One October day in nineteen-seventeen —— (said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a straight chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)—**

**The largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to Daisy Fay’s house.**

**She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville.**

**She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross and make bandages. I was.**

**Well, then, would I tell them that she couldn’t come that day?**

**The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since.**

**His name was Jay Gatsby, and I didn’t lay eyes on him again for over four years — even after I’d met him on Long Island I didn’t realize it was the same man.**

**That was nineteen-seventeen.**

**By the next year I had a few beaux myself, and I began to play in tournaments, so I didn’t see Daisy very often.**

### 背景知识

**💧1. Broadway 百老汇**

He’s quite a character around New York — a denizen of Broadway.（他在纽约是个人物——长居（踞）百老汇。）

这句话是个双关哦~ 老师会在难点分析里给大家做具体的解释，我们先来了解一下百老汇↓

“百老汇”实际上有三个含义：第一个概念是地理概念，指纽约市时报广场附近12个街区以内的36家剧院；第二层含义是在百老汇地区进行的演出；第三层含义是整个百老汇这个产业，这样的产业也包括在纽约市以外的地区，主要以演出百老汇剧目为主的这些剧院。 

总的来说，百老汇是西方戏剧行业的一个巅峰代表，在戏剧和剧场这个行业代表着最高级别的艺术成就和商业成就。

百老汇区指沿着百老汇大道从位于曼哈顿西41街(West 41st Street) 的 Nederlander Theater 剧院往北至西53 街(West 53rd Street) 的 Broadway Theater 剧院。而真正位在百老汇大道上的剧院只有Marquis、Palace、Winter Garden 跟 Broadway 这4 家剧院，沿著百老汇区周围云集了几十家剧院，中段是美国商业性戏剧娱乐中心。

百老汇这一词汇已成为美国戏剧活动的同义语。而今，它也是美国现代歌舞艺术、美国娱乐业的代名词。



**💧2.The World's Series 世界职业棒球联赛**

“Meyer Wolfsheim? No, he’s a gambler.” Gatsby hesitated, then added coolly: “He’s the man who fixed the World’s Series back in 1919.”

"迈尔·沃尔夫山姆？不是，他是个赌棍。"盖茨比犹疑了一下，然后若无其事地补充道，"他就是一九一九年非法操纵世界棒球联赛的那个人。"

fix这里是“以不正当手段操纵（比赛，选举）等”的意思哦，书中Mr. Wolfsheim的原型参考了1919年操纵世界棒球联赛的赌徒Arnold Rothstein.

这是真实的历史事件——1919年的世界职业棒球联赛，爆发了大联盟历史上最严重的放水打假球事件，史称“黑袜事件”（Black Sox Scandal）. 当年交战的二支球队分别是国家联盟的辛辛那提红人队（Cincinnati Reds）和美国联盟的芝加哥白袜队（Chicago White Sox）. 

白袜队是当年战绩最佳的球队，也一致被看好能拿下世界大赛冠军，但先发一垒手Chick Gandil和当地Arnold Rothstein为首的赌客合作，买通七位对白袜队老板不满的球员，在比赛中放水让红人拿到冠军。

大赛结束，红人队果然以五胜三负（当时采九战五胜制）击败白袜队获得冠军。隔年（1920年）球季，放水的传闻不胫而走，联邦检察官及大陪审团开始调查，最终判定参与放水的八名球员均处以终身囚监。

### 课文理解

今天的内容里，Nick对Mr. Wolfshiem进行了更为细致的描绘，包括他的肢体动作（一直在审视周围）以及说话方式（把Oxford说成Oggsford），从这些细节我们可以对这个人物有更感官的印象。此外，Nick和Gatsby的谈话内容其实也透露了两个人在道德标准上的差距 ，同时也让我们从Nick（既不属于Old Money也不属于New Money）的角度对Gatsby这一个阶层的群体有更客观的了解。



💧**Clue 1**: Mr. Wolfshiem is isolated from the party of Nick and Gatsby, which constitutes his insecurity.

Mr. Wolfshiem 作为Gatsby的朋友，更准确说，是他生意上的一个联络人（中间人），其实并不能和Gatsby以及Nick所处的这个阶层相融。

**Evidence 1**: “He went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?” “I’ve heard of it.” “It’s one of the most famous colleges in the world.”

"他上过英国的牛劲大学。你知道牛劲大学吗？" "我听说过。" "它是全世界最有名的大学之一。" 

Mr. Wolfsheim把Oxsford读成了Oggsford，在这之前他还把connection读成了gonnegtion, 这里暗含了两层意思：首先可能是由于口音比较重，所以他在这里读错了，这暗示了他的出身以及教育水平比较低；其次Mr. Wolfsheim可能是出于一种虚荣心理而刻意加重了这两个单词的发音（他很为自己所从事的行业而自豪，同时他也觉得自己能结识Gatsby这样的上流社会的人物是一件值得炫耀的事情，所以特意强调了Gatsby是“牛津”毕业的）。

这里刻画Mr. Wolfshiem形象的方式也体现了Fitzegerald在运用语言上的天赋，比如/g/是浊化音，相比清辅音/k/会在听感上给人更粗犷野蛮的感觉。为了突出Mr. Wolfshiem身上的这种粗野（coarseness），作者还补充了一个非常有趣的细节——

**Evidence 2**: “I see you’re looking at my cuff buttons.” I hadn’t been looking at them, but I did now. They were composed of oddly familiar pieces of ivory. “Finest specimens of human molars,” he informed me.

"我知道你在看我的袖扣。" 我本来并没有看，可是现在倒看了。它们是用几片小象牙制作的，看着眼熟得奇怪。"用特意挑选的真人臼齿做的。"他告诉我。

这里强调Mr. Wolfsheim的袖扣是“真人臼齿”做的是和他本身的一种野蛮（babarian）气质形成对比。作者其实也把这个隐喻藏在他的名字里了——wolf（狼）。比起human, 他更像是 a creature that is half animal and half human.



💧**Clue 2**: Gatsby and Nick hold different moral standards.

Gatsby代表的是不惜一切手段（尤其是非法活动）来获得财富并提升社会地位的New Money阶层（“新富”），和中产阶级出身并且家境优越的Nick形成了强烈的反差，不仅对名利金钱的态度不同，他们的道德观标准也有很大的差异。比如在谈论Mr. Wolfsheim时Gatsby提到——

**Evidence 1**: “How did he happen to do that?” I asked after a minute. “He just saw the opportunity.” “Why isn’t he in jail?” “They can’t get him, old sport. He’s a smart man.”

"他怎么会干那个的？"我过了一分钟才问道。 "他只不过是看中了机会，" "他怎么没坐牢呢？" "他们逮不住他，老兄。他是个非常精明的人。"

令Nick惊讶的恐怕不仅是Mr. Wolfsheim如何得心应手地操纵整个赌球以及逃过警察的追捕（It never occurred to me that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million people — with the single-mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe.）更是Gatsby在讲述这些时所表现出的不以为意，似乎对他来说这些都是很正常并且理所当然的事，而且还有一种侥幸心理——只要足够小心就不会被抓住。

我们可以回想一下昨天的内容里提到的，Nick说过一句意味深长的话：“Anything can happen now that we’ve slid over this bridge,” I thought; “anything at all. . . . ” Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.

对于Nick来说，Gatsby这样的人完全超过了他的想象。可以说，Gatsby正在不断地冲击他的认知底线。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧Cuff Buttons-Men's Jewelry**

**袖扣——男人的首饰**

他停了下来，说道："我知道你在看我的袖扣。"我本来并没有看，可是现在倒看了。（He paused. “I see you’re looking at my cuff buttons.” I hadn’t been looking at them, but I did now.）Mr. Wolfsheim的袖扣材质很interesting，今天我们来了解一下袖扣这种精致小配饰吧~

伴随着18世纪末工业革命的进程，受机器时代和浪漫主义的冲击，袖链（cufflink）发生了一次大的革新。“工业革命”宛若一位经验丰富的工匠师，以一种机械化的技艺与打破常规的手法重新诠释源自文艺复兴时期的装饰臻品。用杆和夹的连接方式取代链条，以方便单手进行佩戴。在这位“工匠师“演绎下，袖链才发展成现在常见到背面有一根小棍的袖扣（cuff buttons）.

袖扣，是一种珠宝首饰，用来固定礼服衬衫的袖口。袖扣由各种不同的材料制成，如玻璃、石头、皮革、金属、贵金属或这些材料的组合。

袖扣只适用于袖口两边有纽扣孔但没有纽扣的衬衫。这种袖口一般是法式衬衫的袖口，可以两边都翻外；或者是“桶式”的，一边向外，另一边向内，这样袖口的下摆就重叠了。

\1. 子弹式（Swivel bar type）是最常见最多款式的形式，也是现代社会为了图方便而设计的，背后是个所谓子弹式转轴金属棍，可360度旋转，竖起后方便穿过四层衬衫袖，也就是自己一个人也容易佩戴。

\2. 鲸尾式（Whale back type）拥有相对大而平滑的前端和笔直的“针”，后端栓扣就像鲸鱼的尾巴，扣紧时与“针”保持90度垂直;因为尺寸较大，非常易于佩戴。

3.礼服专用扣子（Double-panel type），也可以作为袖扣。这种纽扣式背后是个小点的扁平纽扣，比正面的会略小一点，方便穿过扣洞。通常正反面用的材质会相同。但这种就很难自己一只手穿戴。

\4. 盘扣（silk knot type）是由女性时尚而引发灵感的绳结/丝结，用单个或多个颜色丝线盘成的袖扣非常好看，可爱。
