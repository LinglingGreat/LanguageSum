**On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages alongshore, the world and its mistress returned to Gatsby’s house and twinkled hilariously on his lawn.**

> ==twinkle vi. 闪烁 (舞蹈者的双脚)轻快地移动==
>
> ==hilarious adj. 十分有趣的, 非常滑稽的 欢闹的==

**“He’s a bootlegger,” said the young ladies, moving somewhere between his cocktails and his flowers.**

**“One time he killed a man who had found out that he was nephew to Von Hindenburg and second cousin to the devil.**

**Reach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there crystal glass.”**

**Once I wrote down on the empty spaces of a time-table the names of those who came to Gatsby’s house that summer.**

**It is an old time-table now, disintegrating at its folds, and headed “This schedule in effect July 5th, 1922.”**

**But I can still read the gray names, and they will give you a better impression than my generalities of those who accepted Gatsby’s hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing whatever about him.**

> ==hospitality英 [ˌhɒspɪˈtæləti] 美 [ˌhɑ:spɪˈtæləti] n. 殷勤好客；招待==
>
> <font color=red>But I can still read the gray names, / and they will give you a better impression / than my generalities / of those who accepted Gatsby’s hospitality / and paid him the subtle tribute / of knowing nothing / whatever about him.</font>
>
> 但我还认得出那些暗淡的名字，它们可以给你一个比我的笼统概括更清楚的印象，那些人到盖茨比家里做客，却对他一无所知，仿佛这是对他所表示的一种微妙的敬意。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing whatever about him 在这里是一种讽刺，pay tribute to sb也就是“向某人表示敬意”，但为什么“对Gatsby的事情一点都不了解”可以成为一种敬意呢？这里有两种解释：
>
> 首先因为Gatsby本人并不希望别人对他知道得太多，从他小心保护自己的名声以及刻意和他人保持距离就可以看出来。所以宾客们不去打探他的隐私（或是装作什么都不知道）就是对他的一种尊重，subtle tribute理解为a secret, acquiescent tribute（秘密的、默许的致敬）。
>
> 其次这里也可以看成一种讽刺，宾客们并不是真的要像Gatsby致敬，他们对Gatsby一无所知仅仅是因为他们只关心这个殷情的主人十分大方阔绰，利用这一点他们可以无所顾忌地在她的派对上狂欢。所以这里subtle tribute可以理解为nearly a tribute（勉强可以称作“致敬”）。

**From East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches, and a man named Bunsen, whom I knew at Yale, and Doctor Webster Civet, who was drowned last summer up in Maine.**

**And the Hornbeams and the Willie Voltaires, and a whole clan named Blackbuck, who always gathered in a corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near.**

**And the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and Mr. Chrystie’s wife), and Edgar Beaver, whose hair, they say, turned cotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.**

**Clarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember.**

**He came only once, in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the garden.**

**From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O. R. P. Schraeders, and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia, and the Fishguards and the Ripley Snells.**

**Snell was there three days before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel drive that Mrs. Ulysses Swett’s automobile ran over his right hand.**

> ==penitentiary n. <美>监狱 adj. 用作教养的,感化(院)的,教养所的==

**The Dancies came, too, and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over sixty, and Maurice A. Flink, and the Hammerheads, and Beluga the tobacco importer, and Beluga’s girls.**

**From West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Schoen and Gulick the state senator and NewtonOrchid,**

**who controlled Films Par Excellence, and Eckhaust and ClydeCohen and Don S. Schwartze (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the movies in one way or another.**

**And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G. Earl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his wife.**

**Da Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B. (“Rot-Gut.”) Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly —**

**they came to gamble, and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was cleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably next day.**

> ==fluctuate英 [ˈflʌktʃueɪt] 美 [ˈflʌktʃuˌet] vi. 波动；涨落 vt. 使波动；使动摇==

**A man named Klipspringer was there so often and so long that he became known as “the boarder.”— I doubt if he had any other home.**

**Of theatrical people there were Gus Waize and Horace O’donavan and Lester Meyer and George Duckweed and Francis Bull.**

**Also from New York were the Chromes and the Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and the Kellehersand the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and the Smirkes and the young Quinns,**

**divorced now, and Henry L. Palmetto, who killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train in Times Square.**

**Benny McClenahan arrived always with four girls.**

**They were never quite the same ones in physical person, but they were so identical one with another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before.**

**I have forgotten their names — Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela, or Gloria or Judy or June,**

**and their last names were either the melodious names of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American capitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves to be.**

> ==melodious英 [məˈləʊdiəs] 美 [məˈloʊdiəs] adj. 悠扬；悦耳的；有旋律的==
>
> <font color=red>I have forgotten their names / — Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela, or Gloria or Judy or June, / and their last names were / either the melodious names of flowers and months / or the sterner ones of the great American capitalists /whose cousins, if pressed, / they would confess themselves to be.</font>
>
> 她们的名字我忘了——杰奎林，大概是，要不然就是康雪爱拉，或者格洛丽亚或者珠迪或者琼，她们的姓要么是音调悦耳的花名和月份的名字，要么是美国大资本家的庄严的姓氏，只要有人追问，她们就会承认自己是他们的远亲。
>
> **💧句式拆解**
>
> ...whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves to be, if pressed省略了主谓they are, 和后面的they以及themselves都是指前面提到的那些女孩们。
>
> 这里我们可以把定语从句还原一下来帮助理解：if pressed, they would confess themselves to be the cousins of the great American capitalists.
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> 这个句子里面有两个词特别讽刺了这些女孩扭捏和虚荣之态：
>
> press表示to be questioned repeatedly（被反复追问），而confess一般指to admit something that one feels embarrassed or guilty about（承认令自己尴尬或愧疚的事情）。这些女孩当然不是真的因为不情愿而非要在别人的追问下才承认自己是某个名门望族的远亲，只是因为虚荣心使她们故作出矜持的样子。

**In addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O’Brien came there at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer, who had his nose shot off in the war,**

**and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag, his fiancee, and Ardita Fitz-Peters and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of the American Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip, with a man reputed to be her chauffeur, and a prince of something, whom we called Duke, and whose name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten.**

**All these people came to Gatsby’s house in the summer.**

**At nine o’clock, one morning late in July, Gatsby’s gorgeous car lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody from its three-noted horn.**

**It was the first time he had called on me, though I had gone to two of his parties, mounted in his hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation, made frequent use of his beach.**

> ==hydroplane英 [ˈhaɪdrəpleɪn] 美 [ˈhaɪdrəˌplen] n. 水上滑艇，水上飞机==

**“Good morning, old sport. You’re having lunch with me to-day and I thought we’d ride up together.”**

**He was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American —**

**that comes, I suppose, with the absence of lifting work or rigid sitting in youth and, even more, with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games.**

> ==dashboard英 [ˈdæʃbɔ:d] 美 [ˈdæʃbɔ:rd] n. 仪表板；仪表盘==
>
> ==peculiarly adv. 异常地;尤其地;单独地;独特地==
>
> ==sporadic adj. 零星的；分散的；不定时发生的==
>
> <font color=red>He was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car / with that resourcefulness of movement / that is so peculiarly American — / that comes, / I suppose, / with the absence of lifting work or rigid sitting in youth / and, even more, / with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games.</font>
>
> 他站在他车子的挡泥板上，保持着身体的平衡，那种灵活的动作是美国人所特有的——我想这是由于年轻时候不干重活的缘故，更重要的是由于我们各种紧张剧烈的运动练就了一种姿势的自然而优美。
>
> **💧句式拆解**
>
> 注意that is so peculiarly American以及破折号后面的that comes with...and with..都是修饰that resourcefulness of movement的定语从句哦~
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①resourcefulness of movement, resourceful表示“足智多谋的，机智的”，这里形容肢体动作很灵活；
>
> ②with the absence of lifting work or rigid sitting in youth, lifting work指“力气活，重活”，rigid sitting指“僵硬的坐姿”（rigid即stiff）；
>
> ③with the formless grace, formless可以理解为“不受约束的，恣意流露的”，grace在这里所指的优雅是一种ease and flexibility of movement (见Merriam-Webster)，所以formless grace实际上也在和上文的resourcefulness of movement相呼应；
>
> ④of our nervous, sporadic games, nervous表示“激烈的，紧张的”，sporadic原义是“不时发生的”（happening fairly often）, 这里应该是指类似美式橄榄球以及棒球这样有频繁暂停和开始的运动（sport games that stop and start）.
>
> *这一段话语言非常隐晦，有多种解释的可能，这里提供大家一个思路参考：“肢体灵活”以及“姿态任意不受约束”都在暗指当时美国的一种安逸富足的文化，和战时严持戒律的紧张状态不同，人在身体上和思想上都更为放松。而且有了更多的休闲娱乐的时间，包括进行各种运动，浑身上下充满了无处安放的能量和活力（比如下文还提到了Gatsby似乎总是不安分：never quite still）.

**This quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness.**

> ==punctilious adj. 拘礼的,拘谨的==

**He was never quite still; there was always a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.**

**He saw me looking with admiration at his car.**

**“It’s pretty, isn’t it, old sport?”**

**He jumped off to give me a better view.**

**“Haven’t you ever seen it before?”**

**I’d seen it. Everybody had seen it.**

**It was a rich cream color, bright with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hat-boxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and terraced with a labyrinth of wind-shields that mirrored a dozen suns.**

> ==labyrinth英[ˈlæbərɪnθ] 美[ˈlæbəˌrɪnθ] n. 迷宫； （文字，建筑，事件） 错综复杂； 难解的事件==
>
> <font color=red>It was a rich cream color, / bright with nickel, /swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hat-boxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, / and terraced with a labyrinth of wind-shields that mirrored a dozen suns.</font>
>
> 车子是瑰丽的奶油色的，镀镍的地方闪光耀眼，车身长得出奇，四处鼓出帽子盒、大饭盒和工具盒，琳琅满目，还有层层叠叠的挡风玻璃反映出十来个太阳的光辉。
>
> **💧句式拆解**
>
> 这句话虽然很长，但包含主谓的主体部分非常短 ，也就是It was a rich cream color. 其余的都属于修饰性部分：bright with nickel是形容词短语；swollen...with以及and terraced with...是两个过去分词短语结构。
>
> 💧表达精讲
>
> ① swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hat-boxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, in its monstrous length是副词性插入结构，表示“奇长无比”；triumphant是拟人的用法，表示“得意洋洋的，明目张胆的”；hat-boxs, supper-boxes, tool-boxes在这里都是比喻的说法，指车的顶部、车头盖、车灯等地方突起的幅度就像一个个盒子扣在车子上一样。
>
> ②terraced with a labyrinth of wind-shields that mirrored a dozen suns, terraced表示“成阶梯状的”；a labyrinth of表示“（形状）错综复杂的”，labyrinth本身有“迷宫”的意思；mirrored a dozen suns当然也是夸张的说法，这里是强调挡风玻璃非常光亮刺眼。
>
> *这一段虽然大花笔墨来描写Gatsby的豪车，但其实也在侧面刻画Gatsby的人物形象：swollen, monstrous, triumphant, labyrinth这些词都在暗示一种招摇卖弄的（ostentatious）气派，说明Gatsby极力想要展现自己的阔绰和富裕，而且自信心极为膨胀。

**Sitting down behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory, we started to town.**

> ==conservatory n. (培植植物的)温室,暖房==

**I had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and found, to my disappointment, that he had little to say:**

**So my first impression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate road-house next door.**

**And then came that disconcerting ride.**

> ==proprietor n. 所有人,业主==
>
> ==disconcerting adj. 困惑的, 不安的, 尴尬的==

**We hadn’t reached West Egg village before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-colored suit.**

**“Look here, old sport,” he broke out surprisingly.**

**“What’s your opinion of me, anyhow?”**

**A little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which that question deserves.**

**“Well, I’m going to tell you something about my life,” he interrupted.**

**“I don’t want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear.”**

**So he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavored conversation in his halls.**

> ==flavor==
>
> vt. 给…添风味[添情趣，添风趣]；给…调味
>
> 原文：So he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavored conversation in his halls.
>
> 原来他知道那些给他客厅里的谈话增添风趣的离奇的流言蜚语。
>
> 💧flavor作动词的原义是“给 (食物或饮料) 调味”，这里可以理解为“给……增添风趣的内容”。类似用法的词还有season. 
>
> 💧比如：Season the chicken with pepper.
>
> 给鸡肉加胡椒粉调味。

**“I’ll tell you God’s truth.” His right hand suddenly ordered divine retribution to stand by.**

**“I am the son of some wealthy people in the Middle West — all dead now.**

**I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford, because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It is a family tradition.”**

**He looked at me sideways — and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he was lying.**

**He hurried the phrase “educated at Oxford,” or swallowed it, or choked on it, as though it had bothered him before.**

**And with this doubt, his whole statement fell to pieces, and I wondered if there wasn’t something a little sinister about him, after all.**

**“What part of the Middle West?” I inquired casually.**

**“San Francisco.” “I see.”**

**“My family all died and I came into a good deal of money.”**

**His voice was solemn, as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan still haunted him.**

**For a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg, but a glance at him convinced me otherwise.**

**“After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of Europe — Paris, Venice, Rome — collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago.”**

**With an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter.**

> ==incredulous adj. 表示怀疑的, 不相信的==

**The very phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that of a turbaned “character” leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne.**

> ==threadbare英[ˈθredbeə(r)] 美[ˈθredber] adj. 陈旧的； （衣服等） 穿旧的==
>
> adj. 陈旧的;（衣服等）穿旧的
>
> 原文：The very phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that...
>
> 他的措词本身那么陈腐，以致在我脑子里只能是这样的形象……
>
> 💧threadbare本义指“衣服破旧的”（长期磨损后衣服的针线都露出来了：thread线+bare裸露的），引申为“（想法，观点）陈旧的，无趣的”，相当于clichéd. 
>
> 💧比如：a mystery novel with a threadbare plot 一本情节老套的悬疑小说

### 背景知识

**💧1. Worship 礼拜**

星期天早晨，教堂的钟声响彻沿岸村镇的时候（On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages alongshore.）时髦社会的男男女女又回到了盖茨比的别墅，在他的草坪上寻欢作乐。

礼拜日又被称作“安息日”，基督教徒于这一天前往教堂做礼拜。这些年轻时髦的男女不去教堂，而去盖茨比的别墅，可见他们不是虔诚的教徒，或者并无信仰。

礼拜来源于《圣经》中的安息日。上帝六天创造天地，第七天安息 。于是赐福给第七天，并告诫他的子民把安息日守为圣日。

在基督教中，礼拜仪式是一种正式的集体礼拜，通常在周日或周六。基督徒聚集在一起，被教导“神的话语”（Word of God）（也就是《圣经》），同时坚固自己的信仰。

**💧2. San Francisco  旧金山**

"中西部什么地方？"我随便一问。 "旧金山。"（“What part of the Middle West?” I inquired casually. “San Francisco.”）盖茨比说他出身于中西部，然而“我”随口一问他就露馅了，旧金山并不是美国中西部的城市。

旧金山（San Francisco），又译“圣弗朗西斯科”、“三藩市”，美国加利福尼亚州太平洋沿岸的港口城市，是世界著名旅游胜地、加州人口第四大城市。

19世纪这里是美国淘金热的中心地区，早期华人劳工移居美国后多居住于此，称之为“金山”。但直到在澳大利亚的墨尔本发现金矿后，为了与被称作“新金山”的墨尔本做出区别，而改称圣弗朗西斯科为“旧金山”。

旧金山属亚热带地中海气候，拥有享誉世界的旧金山湾区、金门大桥（Golden Gate Bridge）和渔人码头（Fisherman's Wharf），气候冬暖夏凉、阳光充足，临近众多美国国家公园（如约塞米蒂国家公园Yosemite National Park）和加州葡萄酒产地纳帕谷，被誉为“最受美国人欢迎的城市”。

### 课文理解

Nick翻出了去年夏天记下的来参加Gatsby聚会的人员名单，并且不遗余力地把他们都描述了一番。当然这些大都是有头有脸的人物，其中很多细节的刻画也非常传神——



💧**Clue 1**: All Gatsby's parties were attended by the rich and glamorous.

**Evidence 1**:And the Hornbeams and the Willie Voltaires, and a whole clan named Blackbuck, who always gathered in a corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near.

还有霍恩比姆夫妇、威利·伏尔泰夫妇以及布莱克巴克全家，他们总是聚集在一个角落里，不管谁走近，他们都会像山羊一样翘起鼻孔。

有意思的是Blackbuck这一大家子人（a whole clan）, 在派对上他们就像一个小团体在一起（always gathered in a corner）, 不屑于和别人套近乎，很是自视清高。flipped up their noses likegoats这个动作也是一种优越感的表现（to show superiority）. 读到这里，大家有没有想起Nick曾经也把Tom和Daisy描述为“仿佛属于一个秘密团体”（a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged） 呢？

**Evidence 2**: Da Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B. (“Rot-Gut.”) Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly — they came to gamble, and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was cleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably next day.

投资商达·冯坦诺也来这儿，还有爱德·莱格罗、詹姆斯·B·（外号是"坏酒"）菲来特、德·琼大妇和欧内斯特·利里——他们都是来赌钱的，每当菲来特逛进花园里去，那就意味着他输得精光，第二天联合运输公司的股票又得涨一番。

这里Nick讽刺了股票市场其实也不过是富人操纵的棋盘（Ferret要是把钱输光了，第二天他的公司的股票价格就得上涨）。fluctuate profitably其实就是指“价格上涨”，但这样表达非常隐晦：fluctuate表示“上下浮动”，profitably则是暗示“有利可图地，朝有利的方向”。profitably也在暗指这些公司的上层人物只一味寻求自身利益的满足。



💧**Clue 2**: Gatsby is eager to leave a favorable impression on Nick.

**Evidence 1**: “Well, I’m going to tell you something about my life,” he interrupted. “I don’t want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear.

"得啦，我来给你讲讲我自己的身世吧，"他打断了我的话。"你听到这么多闲话，我不希望你从中得到一个对我的错误看法。"

Gatsby显然知道关于他的那些风言风语，但在前文里表现得异常漠不关心的他，现在却主动地向Nick解释，希望他不要产生任何的误会。在这个过程中，他虽然努力想说明清楚，但又不时地露出一些让Nick啼笑皆非的“马脚”（比如他把旧金山说成是在美国的中西部），而且在提到自己的学历时吞吞吐吐，一副难以言喻的样子——

**Evidence 2**: He hurried the phrase “educated at Oxford,” or swallowed it, or choked on it, as though it had bothered him before.

把“在牛津受的教育”这句话匆匆带了过去，或者含糊其词，或者半吞半吐，仿佛这句话以前就使他犯嘀咕。

至此，因为Gatsby漏洞百出的自我陈述，Nick对他依旧抱有很大的怀疑。但也正是因为Gatsby身上自始至终的一种令人困惑又迷人的气质激起了Nick的好奇心，在之后的情节里我们会慢慢看到Nick态度的转变~

### 今日彩蛋

**💧1920s Western Fashion Clothing**  

**20世纪20年代西方服饰风尚**

克拉伦斯·恩狄只来过一次，穿着一条白灯笼裤，还在花园里跟一个姓艾蒂的二流子干了一架。（He came only once, in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the garden.）

白灯笼裤大概是个什么样式？那时候的美国人民都怎么穿呢？今天我们来看看20世纪20年代的西方服饰风尚~

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/9ce1a96d64b434dddacef3c13623ed3e-sz_133778.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



\1. Menswear  男装

在男装领域，20世纪20年代有两个截然不同的时期。在20世纪20年代早期，男性短西装外套（short suit jackets）时尚的特点是高腰夹克，经常搭配皮带，西装外套的翻领不是很宽。这种款式的夹克似乎很大程度上受到了第一次世界大战期间军队所穿制服的影响。裤子比较窄，比较直，穿得很短，男人的袜子常常露出来。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/a62269352a818ce31e33873ca6bd814f-sz_35607.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



到1925年，牛津裤（Oxford bag）开始流行起来。在20世纪20年代后期，双排扣背心，经常搭配单排扣夹克，也变得相当时尚。

在20世纪20年代，男人有各种各样的运动服装可供选择，包括毛衣和短裤short trousers（在美式英语中通常被称为灯笼裤knickers）. 

在白天的正式场合，通常要穿晨装。晚装的话，男士偏爱短礼服（short tuxedo）胜过燕尾服（tail coat）.



\2. Women's Evening Wear 女性的晚装

音乐本身对新青年社会有相当大的吸引力，由于其自发性被认为是20世纪20年代的脉搏（pulse）. 随着新的音乐出现了新的舞蹈。

爵士舞，如查尔斯顿舞（the Charleston），取代了慢华尔兹舞（slow waltz）. Paul Whitman使爵士乐流行起来。事实上，爵士音乐和舞蹈是flapper的起源。

当舞者跳查尔斯顿舞时，脚的快速移动和手臂的摆动就像鸟儿拍打翅膀的动作。像查尔斯顿舞和黑底舞（Black Bottom）这样的舞蹈特别需要女性晚装的复兴，因为爵士舞充满活力。

女性裙子的裙边变得更短，以便让身体更容易移动。此外，裙子上的装饰也富有变化，如条纹装饰，随着身体的运动摆动叮当作响。所以，爵士乐的节奏和舞蹈使得更多有光泽的和华丽的纺织品被用做晚装材料。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/a8bb8f38d20736d1942b851619b7e4fd-sz_31722.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



\3. The boyish figure  中性风貌

在第一次世界大战后，内衣（undergarments ）开始发生变化，符合女生想要变得胸部更平、身材更男孩子气的理想。女性的身材从紧身衣中解放出来，最流行的男孩的外观是通过使用胸衣来实现的。

一些新款式包括衬衫（chemises）、薄的贴身背心和后来的cami-knickers. 这些衣服主要是用人造丝（rayon）做的，颜色柔和，以便穿在半透明的布料下。

年轻的乐迷们之所以喜欢这种风格的下装，是因为他们可以更自由地活动，而且随着快节奏的爵士音乐起舞时也更舒适。在20世纪20年代中期，多功能内衣（all-in-one lingerie）开始流行。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/7b90185a666fbb80f8198869f93191ef-sz_202405.png)



第一个穿裤子、剪短发、不穿紧身胸衣的女性是可可·香奈儿。可可·香奈儿（Coco Chanel）可能是20世纪最具影响力的时尚女性，她为女性时尚的解放和自由做出了巨大贡献。

此时再看20世纪20年代西方的服饰真是既复古又大气，其中有你喜欢的穿搭风格吗？

**“— So I took one look at him,” said Mr. Wolfsheim, shaking my hand earnestly, “and what do you think I did?”**

**“I handed the money to Katspaugh and I said: ‘all right, Katspaugh, don’t pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.’ He shut it then and there.”**

**Gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the restaurant, whereupon Mr. Wolfsheim swallowed a new sentence he was starting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction.**

**“Highballs?” asked the head waiter.**

**“This is a nice restaurant here,” said Mr. Wolfsheim, looking at the Presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling.**

**“But I like across the street better!”**

**“Yes, highballs,” agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfsheim: “It’s too hot over there.”**

**“Hot and small — yes,” said Mr. Wolfsheim, “but full of memories.”**

**“What place is that?” I asked.**

**“The old Metropole.”**

**“The old Metropole,” brooded Mr. Wolfsheim gloomily.**

**“Filled with faces dead and gone.**

**Filled with friends gone now forever.**

**I can’t forget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there.**

**It was six of us at the table, and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening.**

**‘All right,’ says Rosy, and begins to get up, and I pulled him down in his chair.**

**“‘Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don’t you, so help me, move outside this room.’**

**“It was four o’clock in the morning then, and if we’d of raised the blinds we’d of seen daylight.”**

**“Did he go?” I asked innocently.**

**“Sure he went.” Mr. Wolfsheim’s nose flashed at me indignantly.**

**“He turned around in the door and says: ‘Don’t let that waiter take away my coffee!’ Then he went out on the sidewalk, and they shot him three times in his full belly and drove away.”**

**“Four of them were electrocuted,” I said, remembering.**

### 背景知识

**💧1. Hotel Metropole and Rosey Rosenthal**

“The old Metropole,” brooded Mr. Wolfsheim gloomily. “Filled with faces dead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever. I can’t forget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there...”

"老大都会，"沃尔夫山姆先生闷闷不乐地回忆道，"那里聚集过多少早已消逝的面容，聚集过多少如今已经不在人间的朋友。我只要活着就不会忘记他们开枪打死罗西·罗森塔尔的那个晚上。"

大都会酒店是纽约市第一家每个房间都用自来水的酒店。酒店位于时代广场附近的西43街147号，现在被称为“卡萨布兰卡时代广场酒店”(Casablanca hotel Times Square)，住过很多名人，包括Nick Arnstein（美国飞艇设计及制造家）和Bat Masterson（知名体育新闻记者）。

1912年7月16日凌晨，Herman Rosenthal被谋杀的地点就在该酒店。Rosenthal是纽约几个赌场的老板。据称，这起谋杀案是在Charles Becker的授意下进行的。Becker是纽约的一名警探，1915年因这起谋杀案被处决。

James Thurber在1991年出版的Robert Lopresti编辑的《瑟伯论犯罪》*(Thurber on Crime*)一书中，就这个问题写了一篇文章，名为《凌晨两点的大都会》(*Two O’clock at the Metropole*).

大都会酒店后来更名为罗索夫酒店(Hotel Rosoff)，现在是卡萨布兰卡酒店(Casablanca Hotel).



**💧2. Trinity College, Oxford  牛津大学三一学院**

这是在三一学院校园里照的——我左边那个人现在是唐卡斯特伯爵。（It was taken in Trinity Quad — the man on my left is now the Earl of Dorcaster.）

盖茨比拿出了在牛津三一学院拍的照片，这让他的经历看起来又像是真的了。

三一学院（The College of the Holy and Undivided Trinity in the University of Oxford），是英国牛津大学的组成学院之一。该学院由Sir Thomas Pope于1555年创建，位于杜伦学院（Durham College）之前的土地上，在英国牛津的Broad Street，介于牛津大学贝利奥尔学院（Balliol College）和布莱克韦尔书店（Blackwell's bookshop）之间，Turl Street对面。

三一学院培养了三名英国首相，与贝利奥尔学院并列第二。校园周围是铁栅栏而不是围墙，学院的独特的蓝色大门，使其在外观上比牛津大学其他学院更加开放。尽管学校规模庞大，但学生人数相对较少，约有400人。原是一所男子学院，自1979年开始男女同校。

### 课文理解

Gatsby关于自己身世和来历的叙述让Nick感觉半真半假，但这都不影响他对Gatsby依旧有着强烈的好奇心。在今天的内容中，我们也得到了关于Gatsby的更多线索，不仅来源于Nick的隐喻性描绘，还有他们和Gatsby的朋友Mr. Wolfshiem的碰面都透露了不少细节。首先，Nick把Gatsby形容为一个创造可能性的人——

💧**Clue 1**:  Gatsby is exactly the man who creates possibilities.

**Evidence 1**: “Anything can happen now that we’ve slid over this bridge,” I thought; “anything at all. . . . ” Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.

"我们现在一过这座桥，什么事都可能发生了，"我心里想，"无论什么事都会有……" 因此，连盖茨比这种人物也是会出现的，这用不着大惊小怪。

这句话强调了两点：首先是“任何事情都可以发生，甚至像Gatsby这样的”，暗示了Gatsby的矛盾性和不同寻常之处；其次是我们通常只会说一个人exist，而不会用happen这个词。“发生”通常是指事件，会带来一定的影响和结果。因此这里暗示Gatsby之后的一切行为都将带来不可预测的后果（尽管可能是暂时的）。



💧**Clue 2**:  Gatsby is actually engaged in illegal business.

我们在前面的内容里读到了不少关于Gatsby的负面猜测，在昨天Chapter 4的开头，还提到了有很多女士讨论说Gatsby是做走私酒生意的：“He’s a bootlegger,” said the young ladies. bootlegger特指1920s这个时期从事非法制作、进口、销售酒类的人（people who illegally made, imported, or sold alcohol during this time），而非法的背景就是基于当时全国实行的禁酒令（Prohibition）. 虽然Nick并没有直接肯定这一点，但有两个细节都在暗指这个是事实。

**Evidence 1**: “Hot and small — yes,” said Mr. Wolfsheim, “but full of memories.”“What place is that?” I asked. “The old Metropole.”

"又热又小——不错，"沃尔夫山姆先生说，"可是充满了回忆。" "那是哪一家饭店？"我问。"老大都会。"

我们在背景里面已经介绍过，大都会酒店在当时的纽约是一个犯罪场所的聚集地，比如下文提到的那起谋杀案就发生在这里。从Mr. Wolfsheim的口吻也不难读出，他本身很有可能就是混黑社会的（a member of the underworld）. 而Gatsby会和他成为朋友，恐怕也是因为有一定时间的合作关系了。

**Evidence 2**:“Five, with Becker.” His nostrils turned to me in an interested way. “I understand you’re looking for a business gonnegtion.” The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered for me: “Oh, no,” he exclaimed, “this isn’t the man.”

"五个，连贝克在内。"他鼻孔转向我，带着对我感兴趣的神情，"我听说你在找一个做生意的伙伴。" 这两句话连在一起使人听了震惊。盖茨比替我回答："啊，不是，"他大声说，"这不是那个人。"

*gonnegtion即connection

Mr. Wolfsheim误把Nick当成Gatsby找到的一个生意伙伴，结果Gatsby匆忙否认。为什么Gatsby会这么紧张呢？我们看上一句，The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling指的是Mr. Wolfsheim刚说完之前那起谋杀案一共抓了五个人，下一句就提到Gatsby在找生意伙伴，这两句话连在一起极容易让人产生不好的联想。但换一个角度来看，startling还包含另一层含义：Gatsby的确就在从事非法商业活动，而Mr. Wolfsheim阴差阳错地差点泄露了这件事，让Nick也不禁替Gatsby倒吸一口冷气。

这种人物的矛盾性和模糊感可以说是Fitzegerald的刻意为之，同时也是当时浮华的美国梦的一个缩影，光鲜和阴暗两面并存，让人困惑的同时又为其着迷。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****1920s Afternoon Tea and Tea Dresses**

**1920年代上层社会的饮茶风尚**

"不，今天下午。我碰巧打听到你约了贝克小姐喝茶。"（“No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you’re taking Miss Baker to tea.”）尼克约了贝克小姐喝茶，而不是喝咖啡或是其他活动，可见当时饮茶在上层社会非常风行。

大约在9世纪，往来于欧洲和东方的商人、传教士和探险家开始接触中国和日本萌芽中的茶传统。阿拉伯贸易文件中提到的是煮苦茶叶的过程。后来，马可·波罗（Marco Polo）在他关于东方的游记中提到他发现了茶。

然而，直到17世纪茶才在西方出现。一般认为是一位葡萄牙传教士在葡萄牙和中国之间的商队间来回运送茶叶到欧洲的。大概在1610年，第一批日本和中国茶叶经由荷兰东印度公司（Dutch East India Company）由海路运抵欧洲。茶也通过从中国来的骆驼商队在著名的丝绸之路进入俄罗斯。

（茶马古道）



为了满足上流社会喝茶的时尚生活，英国东印度公司不辞艰辛地贩运起茶叶。在最初的几年里，东印度公司每年进口到英国的茶叶还保持在三位数，到了1690年，进口量已经猛增到近四万磅。

（An English Family at Tea, Joseph van Aken, 1720）



茶的流行迅速蔓延到阿姆斯特丹、巴黎和伦敦等城市，尽管其高昂的价格限制了皇室和贵族阶层的消费。饮茶在当时还是一种新奇的事物，在这个探索和发现的时代，它让富人们可以参与一些东方的冒险活动。

由于下午茶的盛行，也衍生出了下午茶的服饰。室内聚会则选择大多数适合季节的颜色。富裕家庭的礼服一般是优雅、轻盈，较多是白色的。搭配的是轻薄的透明丝袜，白色或类似的淡色。鞋子也可以是白色的高跟鞋，或者是T型带的中跟鞋。再加上一双白色棉质手套和一顶白色草帽，饰以白色花边。上层阶级穿纯白色的衣服，因为他们可以负担得起所有搭配的是饰品。

（1926 Young Miss Party Dresses）



对于中产阶级来说，选择一件可以搭配黑色皮靴、深色长筒袜和任何颜色帽子的彩色下午装是更好的选择。每个中产阶级女性的衣橱里都有一件半正式的（semi formal）下午茶礼服。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/5c62ca003852753957c92db3a3959351-sz_4055126.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmhigh)



原来饮茶在西方也是这样一种美的享受，气定神闲的你也来一杯吧~

**I think that, except for my presence,he would have taken one short glance beneath our own table.**

**“Look here, old sport,” said Gatsby, leaning toward me, “I’m afraid I made you a little angry this morning in the car.”**

**There was the smile again, but this time I held out against it.**

**“I don’t like mysteries,” I answered.**

**“And I don’t understand why you won’t come out frankly and tell me what you want. Why has it all got to come through Miss Baker?”**

**“Oh, it’s nothing underhand,” he assured me.**

**“Miss Baker’s a great sportswoman, you know, and she’d never do anything that wasn’t all right.”**

**Suddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up, and hurried from the room, leaving me with Mr. Wolfsheim at the table.**

**“I’ve heard of it.” “It’s one of the most famous colleges in the world.”**

**“Have you known Gatsby for a long time?” I inquired.**

**“Several years,” he answered in a gratified way.**

**“I made the pleasure of his acquaintance just after the war.**

**But I knew I had discovered a man of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour.**

**“I see you’re looking at my cuff buttons.”**

**I hadn’t been looking at them, but I did now.**

**They were composed of oddly familiar pieces of ivory.**

**“Finest specimens of human molars,” he informed me.**

**“Well!” I inspected them.**

**“That’s a very interesting idea.” “Yeah.”**

**He flipped his sleeves up under his coat.**

**“Yeah, Gatsby’s very careful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend’s wife.”**

**When the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat down Mr. Wolfsheim drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet.**

**“I have enjoyed my lunch,” he said, “and I’m going to run off from you two young men before I outstay my welcome.”**

**“Don’t hurry, Meyer,” said Gatsby, without enthusiasm.**

**Mr. Wolfsheim raised his hand in a sort of benediction.**

**“You’re very polite, but I belong to another generation,” he announced solemnly.**

**“You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and your ——”**

**He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his hand.**

**“As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won’t impose myself on you any longer.”**

**I wondered if I had said anything to offend him.**

>
> *这里并不是说Mr. Wolfshiem就“住”在百老汇，denizen是一个比喻的说法，有两层含义：一是他的活动/势力范围在百老汇；二是讽刺他有时候非常情绪化、多愁善感，因为百老汇是纽约的戏剧艺术中心，所以这里其实是暗讽Mr. Wolfshiem is a "Broadway" (dramatic) person.（结合上文说He becomes very sentimental sometimes以及This is one of his sentimental days）. 

**“Who is he, anyhow, an actor?”“No.”**

**“A dentist?” “Meyer Wolfsheim? No, he’s a gambler.”**

### 背景知识

**💧1. Broadway 百老汇**

He’s quite a character around New York — a denizen of Broadway.（他在纽约是个人物——长居（踞）百老汇。）

这句话是个双关哦~ 老师会在难点分析里给大家做具体的解释，我们先来了解一下百老汇↓

“百老汇”实际上有三个含义：第一个概念是地理概念，指纽约市时报广场附近12个街区以内的36家剧院；第二层含义是在百老汇地区进行的演出；第三层含义是整个百老汇这个产业，这样的产业也包括在纽约市以外的地区，主要以演出百老汇剧目为主的这些剧院。 

总的来说，百老汇是西方戏剧行业的一个巅峰代表，在戏剧和剧场这个行业代表着最高级别的艺术成就和商业成就。

百老汇区指沿着百老汇大道从位于曼哈顿西41街(West 41st Street) 的 Nederlander Theater 剧院往北至西53 街(West 53rd Street) 的 Broadway Theater 剧院。而真正位在百老汇大道上的剧院只有Marquis、Palace、Winter Garden 跟 Broadway 这4 家剧院，沿著百老汇区周围云集了几十家剧院，中段是美国商业性戏剧娱乐中心。

百老汇这一词汇已成为美国戏剧活动的同义语。而今，它也是美国现代歌舞艺术、美国娱乐业的代名词。



**💧2.The World's Series 世界职业棒球联赛**

“Meyer Wolfsheim? No, he’s a gambler.” Gatsby hesitated, then added coolly: “He’s the man who fixed the World’s Series back in 1919.”

"迈尔·沃尔夫山姆？不是，他是个赌棍。"盖茨比犹疑了一下，然后若无其事地补充道，"他就是一九一九年非法操纵世界棒球联赛的那个人。"

fix这里是“以不正当手段操纵（比赛，选举）等”的意思哦，书中Mr. Wolfsheim的原型参考了1919年操纵世界棒球联赛的赌徒Arnold Rothstein.

这是真实的历史事件——1919年的世界职业棒球联赛，爆发了大联盟历史上最严重的放水打假球事件，史称“黑袜事件”（Black Sox Scandal）. 当年交战的二支球队分别是国家联盟的辛辛那提红人队（Cincinnati Reds）和美国联盟的芝加哥白袜队（Chicago White Sox）. 

白袜队是当年战绩最佳的球队，也一致被看好能拿下世界大赛冠军，但先发一垒手Chick Gandil和当地Arnold Rothstein为首的赌客合作，买通七位对白袜队老板不满的球员，在比赛中放水让红人拿到冠军。

大赛结束，红人队果然以五胜三负（当时采九战五胜制）击败白袜队获得冠军。隔年（1920年）球季，放水的传闻不胫而走，联邦检察官及大陪审团开始调查，最终判定参与放水的八名球员均处以终身囚监。

### 课文理解

今天的内容里，Nick对Mr. Wolfshiem进行了更为细致的描绘，包括他的肢体动作（一直在审视周围）以及说话方式（把Oxford说成Oggsford），从这些细节我们可以对这个人物有更感官的印象。此外，Nick和Gatsby的谈话内容其实也透露了两个人在道德标准上的差距 ，同时也让我们从Nick（既不属于Old Money也不属于New Money）的角度对Gatsby这一个阶层的群体有更客观的了解。



💧**Clue 1**: Mr. Wolfshiem is isolated from the party of Nick and Gatsby, which constitutes his insecurity.

Mr. Wolfshiem 作为Gatsby的朋友，更准确说，是他生意上的一个联络人（中间人），其实并不能和Gatsby以及Nick所处的这个阶层相融。

**Evidence 1**: “He went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?” “I’ve heard of it.” “It’s one of the most famous colleges in the world.”

"他上过英国的牛劲大学。你知道牛劲大学吗？" "我听说过。" "它是全世界最有名的大学之一。" 

Mr. Wolfsheim把Oxsford读成了Oggsford，在这之前他还把connection读成了gonnegtion, 这里暗含了两层意思：首先可能是由于口音比较重，所以他在这里读错了，这暗示了他的出身以及教育水平比较低；其次Mr. Wolfsheim可能是出于一种虚荣心理而刻意加重了这两个单词的发音（他很为自己所从事的行业而自豪，同时他也觉得自己能结识Gatsby这样的上流社会的人物是一件值得炫耀的事情，所以特意强调了Gatsby是“牛津”毕业的）。

这里刻画Mr. Wolfshiem形象的方式也体现了Fitzegerald在运用语言上的天赋，比如/g/是浊化音，相比清辅音/k/会在听感上给人更粗犷野蛮的感觉。为了突出Mr. Wolfshiem身上的这种粗野（coarseness），作者还补充了一个非常有趣的细节——

**Evidence 2**: “I see you’re looking at my cuff buttons.” I hadn’t been looking at them, but I did now. They were composed of oddly familiar pieces of ivory. “Finest specimens of human molars,” he informed me.

"我知道你在看我的袖扣。" 我本来并没有看，可是现在倒看了。它们是用几片小象牙制作的，看着眼熟得奇怪。"用特意挑选的真人臼齿做的。"他告诉我。

这里强调Mr. Wolfsheim的袖扣是“真人臼齿”做的是和他本身的一种野蛮（babarian）气质形成对比。作者其实也把这个隐喻藏在他的名字里了——wolf（狼）。比起human, 他更像是 a creature that is half animal and half human.



💧**Clue 2**: Gatsby and Nick hold different moral standards.

Gatsby代表的是不惜一切手段（尤其是非法活动）来获得财富并提升社会地位的New Money阶层（“新富”），和中产阶级出身并且家境优越的Nick形成了强烈的反差，不仅对名利金钱的态度不同，他们的道德观标准也有很大的差异。比如在谈论Mr. Wolfsheim时Gatsby提到——

**Evidence 1**: “How did he happen to do that?” I asked after a minute. “He just saw the opportunity.” “Why isn’t he in jail?” “They can’t get him, old sport. He’s a smart man.”

"他怎么会干那个的？"我过了一分钟才问道。 "他只不过是看中了机会，" "他怎么没坐牢呢？" "他们逮不住他，老兄。他是个非常精明的人。"

令Nick惊讶的恐怕不仅是Mr. Wolfsheim如何得心应手地操纵整个赌球以及逃过警察的追捕（It never occurred to me that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million people — with the single-mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe.）更是Gatsby在讲述这些时所表现出的不以为意，似乎对他来说这些都是很正常并且理所当然的事，而且还有一种侥幸心理——只要足够小心就不会被抓住。

我们可以回想一下昨天的内容里提到的，Nick说过一句意味深长的话：“Anything can happen now that we’ve slid over this bridge,” I thought; “anything at all. . . . ” Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.

对于Nick来说，Gatsby这样的人完全超过了他的想象。可以说，Gatsby正在不断地冲击他的认知底线。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧Cuff Buttons-Men's Jewelry**

**袖扣——男人的首饰**

他停了下来，说道："我知道你在看我的袖扣。"我本来并没有看，可是现在倒看了。（He paused. “I see you’re looking at my cuff buttons.” I hadn’t been looking at them, but I did now.）Mr. Wolfsheim的袖扣材质很interesting，今天我们来了解一下袖扣这种精致小配饰吧~

伴随着18世纪末工业革命的进程，受机器时代和浪漫主义的冲击，袖链（cufflink）发生了一次大的革新。“工业革命”宛若一位经验丰富的工匠师，以一种机械化的技艺与打破常规的手法重新诠释源自文艺复兴时期的装饰臻品。用杆和夹的连接方式取代链条，以方便单手进行佩戴。在这位“工匠师“演绎下，袖链才发展成现在常见到背面有一根小棍的袖扣（cuff buttons）.

袖扣，是一种珠宝首饰，用来固定礼服衬衫的袖口。袖扣由各种不同的材料制成，如玻璃、石头、皮革、金属、贵金属或这些材料的组合。

袖扣只适用于袖口两边有纽扣孔但没有纽扣的衬衫。这种袖口一般是法式衬衫的袖口，可以两边都翻外；或者是“桶式”的，一边向外，另一边向内，这样袖口的下摆就重叠了。

\1. 子弹式（Swivel bar type）是最常见最多款式的形式，也是现代社会为了图方便而设计的，背后是个所谓子弹式转轴金属棍，可360度旋转，竖起后方便穿过四层衬衫袖，也就是自己一个人也容易佩戴。

\2. 鲸尾式（Whale back type）拥有相对大而平滑的前端和笔直的“针”，后端栓扣就像鲸鱼的尾巴，扣紧时与“针”保持90度垂直;因为尺寸较大，非常易于佩戴。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/f1c524da42e9a917011ba745914e7bf0-sz_92216.jpeg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



3.礼服专用扣子（Double-panel type），也可以作为袖扣。这种纽扣式背后是个小点的扁平纽扣，比正面的会略小一点，方便穿过扣洞。通常正反面用的材质会相同。但这种就很难自己一只手穿戴。

\4. 盘扣（silk knot type）是由女性时尚而引发灵感的绳结/丝结，用单个或多个颜色丝线盘成的袖扣非常好看，可爱。

**He came down with a hundred people in four private cars, and hired a whole floor of the Muhlbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.**

**I was bridesmaid.**

**I came into her room half an hour before the bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June night in her flowered dress— and as drunk as a monkey.**

**She had a bottle of Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.**

**“’Gratulate me,” she muttered. “Never had a drink before, but oh how I do enjoy it.”**

**“What’s the matter, Daisy?”**

**I was scared, I can tell you; I’d never seen a girl like that before.**

**“Here, deares’.”**

**She groped around in a waste-basket she had with her on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls.**

**“Take ’em down-stairs and give ’em back to whoever they belong to. Tell’em all Daisy’s change’ her mine. Say: ‘Daisy’s change’ her mine!’.”**

**She began to cry — she cried and cried.**

**I rushed out and found her mother’s maid, and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath.**

**She wouldn’t let go of the letter.**

**She took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up into a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the soap-dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.**

**But she didn’t say another word.**

**We gave her spirits of ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress, and half an hour later, when we walked out of the room, the pearls were around her neck and the incident was over.**

**Next day at five o’clock she married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver, and started off on a three months’ trip to the South Seas.**

**I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back, and I thought I’d never seen a girl so mad about her husband.**

**If he left the room for a minute she’d look around uneasily, and say: “Where’s Tom gone?” and wear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the door.**

**She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour, rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable delight.**

> ==unfathomable英 [ʌnˈfæðəməbl] 美 [ʌnˈfæðəməbəl] adj. 深得无法到达底部的；高深莫测的==

**It was touching to see them together — it made you laugh in a hushed, fascinated way.**

**That was in August.**

**A week after I left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night, and ripped a front wheel off his car.**

> ==wagon英 [ˈwægən] 美 [ˈwæɡən] n. 四轮的运货马车；<英>铁路货车==

**The girl who was with him got into the papers, too, because her arm was broken — she was one of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.**

**The next April Daisy had her little girl, and they went to France for a year.**

**I saw them one spring in Cannes, and later in Deauville, and then they came back to Chicago to settle down.**

**Daisy was popular in Chicago, as you know.**

**They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich and wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation.**

**Perhaps because she doesn’t drink.**

**It’s a great advantage not to drink among hard-drinking people.**

**You can hold your tongue, and, moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they don’t see or care.**

**Well, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first time in years.**

**It was when I asked you — do you remember? — if you knew Gatsby in West Egg.**

**After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me up, and said: “What Gatsby?” and when I described him — I was half asleep — she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used to know.**

**When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza for half an hour and were driving in a victoria through Central Park.**

**“He wants to know,” continued Jordan, “if you’ll invite Daisy to your house some afternoon and then let him come over.”**

**The modesty of the demand shook me.**

> ②so that he could “come over” some afternoon to a stranger’s garden, come over 也就是drop in, 表示“顺便拜访”（to visit casually）, 一般不是正式的或提前约好的；some afternoon “某个午后”，some在这里不是表示“一些”，而是“某个”（不知道确切哪个）；a stranger's garden 在这里其实就是指Tom的庄园。
>
> *这里"come over"加上双引号是暗示Gatsby并不只是想着某一天能够“顺便”拜访，他对这一切已经预谋计划了很久。

**“Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?”**

**“He’s afraid, he’s waited so long. He thought you might be offended. You see, he’s a regular tough underneath it all.”**

**Something worried me.**

**“Why didn’t he ask you to arrange a meeting?”**

**“He wants her to see his house,” she explained.**

**“And your house is right next door.”**

**“Oh!” “I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties, some night,” went on Jordan,**

**“but she never did. Then he began asking people casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found.**

**It was that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have heard the elaborate way he worked up to it.**

**Of course, I immediately suggested a luncheon in New York — and I thought he’d go mad:**

**“‘I don’t want to do anything out of the way!’ he kept saying.**

**‘I want to see her right next door.’**

**“When I said you were a particular friend of Tom’s, he started to abandon the whole idea.**

**He doesn’t know very much about Tom, though he says he’s read a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse of Daisy’s name.”**

**It was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm around Jordan’s golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her to dinner.**

**Suddenly I wasn’t thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more, but of this clean, hard, limited person, who dealt in universal scepticism, and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm.**

> ①but of this clean, hard, limited person, but后面省略了主谓（I was thinking）；clean, hard, limited “清爽、健美、不太动脑筋”，这些都是Jordan身上和Daisy以及Gatsby不同的特质，因此对Nick产生了一种反差的吸引力；

> ②who dealt in universal scepticism, deal in在前面介绍过，表示“对……感兴趣”（to be interested or involved in sth）; universal scepticism指“对一切都抱有怀疑态度”，universal表示present or occurring everywhere. 

**A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement: “There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.”**

**“And Daisy ought to have something in her life,” murmured Jordan to me.**

**“Does she want to see Gatsby?”**

**“She’s not to know about it. Gatsby doesn’t want her to know. You’re just supposed to invite her to tea.”**

**We passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the facade of Fifty-ninth Street, a block of delicate pale light,beamed down into the park.**

**Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan, I had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs, and so I drew up the girl beside me, tightening my arms.**

**Her wan, scornful mouth smiled, and so I drew her up again closer, this time to my face.**

### 背景知识

**💧1. Wagon 四轮货车**

A week after I left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night, and ripped a front wheel off his car.（我离开圣巴巴拉一个星期以后，汤姆一天夜晚在凡图拉公路上与一辆货车相撞，把他车上的前轮撞掉了一只。）

四轮货车（wagon）是一种重型四轮车辆，用于运输货物、商品（commodities）、农产品、用品（supplies），有时也用于运送人。四轮运货马车通常由成对或组队的马、骡子或牛等动物拉。然而，也有人力推动的货车，比如采矿车（mining corfs）.

四轮货车车体的转弯半径是一个长期存在的问题，由前轮和车座之间的距离决定，也就是旋转的车轮在转弯时与车体侧面相撞的位置。这也是货车驾驶时要特别注意的安全隐患。

Tom的汽车撞上了货车却也大伤，这里暗含作者想表达的20世纪20年代新旧观念的碰撞。



**💧2. Sheik of Araby**

通过引用作者所处的爵士时代的这首歌，暗示了19世纪末20世纪初歌曲集Tin Pan Alley的热门歌曲，以及电影*The Sheik of Araby*，其中好莱坞偶像Rudolph Valentino扮演异国情调的浪漫主角。因此，这首歌的歌词代表了盖茨比与黛西重新联系的浪漫计划，也就是将她引入盖茨比的豪宅附近，在那里重新点燃他们年轻的爱情。

当尼克和贝克穿过公园时，听到小孩们唱"At night when you’re are asleep, Into your tent I’ll creep"——就是在说，盖茨比希望“爬进”黛西的世界的帐篷，用他的财富和爱呼唤她。

### 课文理解

Gatsby和Daisy当初相恋以及最终因为家庭的阻挠而被迫分开的故事终于被揭开，其中最令人惊讶的部分大概就是Daisy对Gatsby曾经也是痴恋至极的。1917年Gatsby作为服役士兵要被派往前线，当时的Dasiy已经收拾后行李准备去纽约给他送行，但却遭到阻拦，为此她和家里的关系还闹得非常僵。

（She was effectually prevented, but she wasn’t on speaking terms with her family for several weeks. — Chapter 4.3）

而此后她便冷静下来，振奋精神重新开始参加社交舞会，在认识Tom之后闪电般地结了婚。但这中间还有一个小插曲：婚礼的前夕她喝得烂醉，手上拿着一封（Gatsby寄来的）信；Daisy不仅撕心裂肺的痛哭，甚至还把Tom送给她的珍珠项链扔在垃圾桶里，大喊着要取消婚约。但最后还是婚礼照常，婚后她甚至对Tom出奇的依赖。两个人很快有了女儿，之后便举家四处游玩。

这一段非常揪心，但更多的是痛心，因为Daisy最后没有选择等Gatsby回来的原因非常简单：Gatsby和她门不当户不对，她需要的是金钱和地位带来的安全感，爱情只是附属品。而她和Tom之间的婚姻也不是靠爱情来维系的，所以实际上Jordan看到的她对Tom的依赖，其实来源于她的不安全感。Tom不是一个安分之辈，他一早就开始在外面和情妇幽会了——



💧**Clue 1**: Tom's been having affairs from early on, which Daisy is well-informed.

**Evidence 1**: The girl who was with him got into the papers, too, because her arm was broken — she was one of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.

跟他同车的姑娘也上了报，因为她的胳膊撞断了——她是圣巴巴拉饭店里的一个收拾房间的女佣人。 

Tom发生车祸的事情登了报，同时还有一位姑娘，毫无疑问就是他的情妇了。这里Jordan没有直接说破，但已经不言自明了。当然Daisy也肯定知道了这件事情，而且当时才是他们新婚不久，孩子都还没出生。从Jordan的叙述里，我们不知道Daisy当时有什么反应，但至少他们并未因此分开。并且三年来，Daisy也一直试图装作毫不在意（可以回想一下Myrtle打来电话的时候她的反应）。

和Daisy的甘心维持一段充满裂痕的婚姻相比，Gatsby在感情的选择上更加勇敢和炽烈——



💧**Clue 2**: Daisy is all that Gatsby is passionate about. 



**Evidence 1**: “I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties, some night,” went on Jordan, “but she never did. Then he began asking people casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found...”

"我想他大概指望哪天晚上她会翩然而至，光临他的一次宴会，"乔丹继续说，"但是她始终没有来过、后来他就开始有意无意地问人家是否认识她，而我是他找到的第一个人……"

Gatsby买下Daisy家对岸的豪宅，甚至没日没夜的一整个夏天都在举办派对，为的就是或许有一天Daisy会无意经过然后停下、目睹他现在拥有的这一切财富。

这其实也解释了为什么在前面的派对上，Gatsby总是让人感觉距离遥远，他从不参与客人们的狂欢，而且随时都在维持一种矜持得体的姿态，说话时也总小心拿捏。

（"I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care." — Chapter 3.2）

Gatsby之所以对周围的一切都如此冷淡提防，是因为他无时无刻不在想着Dasiy——这个给了他所有热切盼望的人。

**Then I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that my house was on fire.**

**Two o’clock and the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with light,which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires.**

> ==elongate英 ['iːlɒŋgeɪt] 美 [ɪˈlɔ:ŋgeɪt] vt. 拉长；使延长；使伸长==

**Turning a corner, I saw that it was Gatsby’s house, lit from tower to cellar.**

**At first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved itself into “hide-and-go-seek” or “sardines-in-the-box” with all the house thrown open to the game.**

> ③hide-and-go-seek and sardines-in-the-box 都是指“捉迷藏”；

>
> 向公众开放宫殿的计划已经宣布了。
>
> *盖茨比的豪宅灯火通明，但又听不到一点声音，所以Nick用诙谐的语气说就好像来参加聚会的人都在玩捉迷藏一样。

**But there wasn’t a sound.**

**Only wind in the trees, which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again as if the house had winked into the darkness.**

**As my taxi groaned away I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.**

**“Your place looks like the World’s Fair,” I said.**

**“Does it?” He turned his eyes toward it absently.**

**“I have been glancing into some of the rooms. Let’s go to Coney Island,old sport. In my car.”**

**“It’s too late.”**

**“Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming-pool? I haven’t made use of it all summer.”**

**“I’ve got to go to bed.” “All right.”**

**He waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.**

**“I talked with Miss Baker,” I said after a moment.**

**“I’m going to call up Daisy to-morrow and invite her over here to tea.”**

**“Oh, that’s all right,” he said carelessly.**

**“I don’t want to put you to any trouble.”**

**“What day would suit you?”**

**“What day would suit you?” he corrected me quickly.**

**“I don’t want to put you to any trouble, you see.”**

**“How about the day after to-morrow?” He considered for a moment.**

**Then, with reluctance:“I want to get the grass cut,” he said.**

**We both looked at the grass — there was a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began.**

> ==ragged==
>
> adj. 衣衫褴褛的；参差不齐的，凹凸不平的
>
> 原文：We both looked at the grass — there was a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began.
>
> 我们俩都低头看了看草地——在我的乱蓬蓬的草地和他那一大片剪得整整齐齐的深绿色草坪之间有一条很清楚的分界线。
>
> 💧ragged在这里形容Nick家的草坪因为没有修剪而一片参差不齐的样子；这个词来源于rag, 表示“破布，抹布”，所以in rags可以指“衣衫褴褛”（相当于ragged）；以及from rags to riches就是指像Gatsby这样的白手起家。

**I suspected that he meant my grass.**

**“There’s another little thing,” he said uncertainly, and hesitated.**

**“Would you rather put it off for a few days?” I asked.**

**“Oh, it isn’t about that. At least ——” He fumbled with a series of beginnings.**

> ==fumble英 ['fʌmb(ə)l] 美 [ˈfʌmbəl] vt. 摸索；笨拙地做==

**“Why, I thought — why, look here, old sport, you don’t make much money, do you?”**

**“Not very much.”**

**This seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently.**

**“I thought you didn’t, if you’ll pardon my — You see, I carry on a little business on the side, a sort of side line, you understand.**

**And I thought that if you don’t make very much — You’re selling bonds, aren’t you, old sport?”**

**“Trying to.”**

**“Well, this would interest you. It wouldn’t take up much of your time and you might pick up a nice bit of money. It happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing.”**

**I realize now that under different circumstances that conversation might have been one of the crises of my life.**

**But, because the offer was obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no choice except to cut him off there.**

> <font color=red> I realize now / that under different circumstances / that conversation / might have been one of the crises of my life. / But, because the offer was / obviously and tactlessly / for a service to be rendered, / I had no choice / except to cut him off there.</font>

> 我现在认识到，如果当时情况不同，那次谈话可能会是我一生中的一个转折点，但是，因为这个建议说得很露骨，很不得体，明摆着是为了酬谢我给他帮的忙，我别无选择，只有当场把他的话打断。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①under different circumstances 指“在不同情况下”，也就是如果Gatsby不是为了酬谢Nick而提出要介绍他做点小生意；
>
> ②might have been one of the crises of my life, might have been是过去时的虚拟语气，还原成完整句子是：If it had been under different circumstances, that conversation might have been one of the crises of my life.
>
> ③obviously and tactlessly “直白而缺乏策略地”，这里说明Gatsby是一个不善社交并且不懂圆滑的人；

**“I’ve got my hands full,” I said.**

**“I’m much obliged but I couldn’t take on any more work.”**

**“You wouldn’t have to do any business with Wolfsheim.”**

**Evidently he thought that I was shying away from the “gonnegtion” mentioned at lunch, but I assured him he was wrong.**

**He waited a moment longer, hoping I’d begin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be responsive, so he went unwillingly home.**

**The evening had made me light-headed and happy; I think I walked into a deep sleep as I entered my front door.**

**So I didn’t know whether or not Gatsby went to Coney Island, or for how many hours he “glanced into rooms” while his house blazed gaudily on.**

**I called up Daisy from the office next morning, and invited her to come to tea.**

**“Don’t bring Tom,” I warned her. “What?”**

**“Don’t bring Tom.”**

**“Who is ‘Tom’?” she asked innocently.**

**The day agreed upon was pouring rain.**

**At eleven o’clock a man in a raincoat, dragging a lawn-mower, tapped at my front door and said that Mr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass.**

**This reminded me that I had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back, so I drove into West Egg Village to search for her among soggy, whitewashed alleys and to buy some cups and lemons and flowers.**

**The flowers were unnecessary, for at two o’clock a greenhouse arrived from Gatsby’s, with innumerable receptacles to contain it.**

> ==receptacle英 [rɪ'septək(ə)l] 美 [rɪˈsɛptəkəl] n. [植] 花托；容器==

**An hour later the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby, in a white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold-colored tie, hurried in.**

**He was pale, and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes.**

**“Is everything all right?” he asked immediately.**

**“The grass looks fine, if that’s what you mean.”**

**“What grass?” he inquired blankly.**

**“Oh, the grass in the yard.”**

**He looked out the window at it, but, judging from his expression, I don’t believe he saw a thing.**

**“Looks very good,” he remarked vaguely.**

**“One of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four. I think it was the Journal. Have you got everything you need in the shape of — of tea?”**

**I took him into the pantry, where he looked a little reproachfully at the Finn.**

**Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen shop.**

> ==scrutinize英 ['skru:tənaɪz] 美 [ˈskrutn:ˌaɪz] vi. 细阅；作详细检查==

**“Will they do?” I asked.**

**“Of course, of course! They’re fine!” and he added hollowly, “ . . . old sport.”**

**The rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist, through which occasional thin drops swam like dew.**

**Gatsby looked with vacant eyes through a copy of Clay’s Economics, starting at the Finnish tread that shook the kitchen floor, and peering toward the bleared windows from time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking place outside.**

**Finally he got up and informed me, in an uncertain voice, that he was going home.**

**“Why’s that?”**

**“Nobody’s coming to tea. It’s too late!”**

**He looked at his watch as if there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere.**

**“I can’t wait all day.”**

**“Don’t be silly; it’s just two minutes to four.”**

**He sat down miserably, as if I had pushed him, and simultaneously there was the sound of a motor turning into my lane.**

**We both jumped up, and, a little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard.**

**Under the dripping bare lilac-trees a large open car was coming up the drive. It stopped.**

**Daisy’s face, tipped sideways beneath a three-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic smile.**

**“Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?”**

**The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain.**

**I had to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone, before any words came through.**

**A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek, and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car.**

**“Are you in love with me,” she said low in my ear, “or why did I have to come alone?”**

**“That’s the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur to go far away and spend an hour.”**

**“Come back in an hour, Ferdie.”**

**Then in a grave murmur:“His name is Ferdie”**

**“Does the gasoline affect his nose?”**

**“I don’t think so,” she said innocently. “Why?”**

**We went in. To my overwhelming surprise the living-room was deserted.**

**“Well, that’s funny,” I exclaimed.**

**“What’s funny?” She turned her head as there was a light dignified knocking at the front door.**

**I went out and opened it.**

**Gatsby, pale as death, with his hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a puddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes.**

**It wasn’t a bit funny.**

**Aware of the loud beating of my own heart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain.**

**For half a minute there wasn’t a sound.**

**Then from the living-room I heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh, followed by Daisy’s voice on a clear artificial note: “I certainly am awfully glad to see you again.”**

**A pause; it endured horribly.**

**I had nothing to do in the hall, so I went into the room.**

### 背景知识

**💧1. Coney Island 康尼岛**

 Let’s go to Coney Island, old sport. In my car. （咱俩到康尼岛去玩吧，老兄。坐我的车子去。）

康尼岛（Coney Island，又译科尼岛）是位于美国纽约市布鲁克林区的半岛，原本为一座海岛，是长岛最南端的一片沙洲，约长四英里、宽一点五英里。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/432709d7e4815b6176f0754904598735-sz_72051.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



在20世纪初，通过填埋与长岛其他地区相连。半岛的住宅区西部是一个由6万人组成的社区，西边是海门，东面是布莱顿海滩和曼哈顿海滩，南面是下湾，北面是格雷夫森德。其面向大西洋的海滩是美国知名的休闲娱乐区域。

康尼岛最初是殖民城镇Gravesend的一部分。到了19世纪中期，它成了一个海滨度假胜地（seaside resort），到了19世纪末，游乐园也在这个地方建成。

“Or why did I have to come alone?”“That’s the secret of Castle Rackrent.”（"要不然为什么我非得一个人来呢？" "那是拉克伦特堡的秘密。”）

*Castle Rackrent*（《拉克伦特堡》，又译《雷克兰特古堡》）是英国作家Maria Edgeworth于1800年出版的短篇小说，通常被认为是第一部历史小说，第一部英文地域小说。也被认为是第一部大庄园小说和第一部传奇小说。

该作品是第一个在小说中设置既有角色又有旁观解说者人物的。柯克帕特里克说评价道：“既借鉴了传统文学的类型，又不相似于它们中的任何一个。”

《拉克伦特堡》小说的背景设定在1782年宪法之前，拉克伦特家族的四代继承人连续的不善经营使得家业在讲述者狡猾的儿子杰克·奎尔克的诡计下被瓦解侵占。

在小说的最后，Jason和已经康复和Lay Condy因庄园的头衔而告上法庭。有些人说Jason会得到这片土地，另一些人则说Lady Condy会胜出。而结果只能由Thady去猜测了，也留给读者一个开放式结尾。

尼克借《拉克伦特堡》小说与黛西打了个哑谜，暗示她猜不到请她过来的目的究竟是什么。

### 课文理解

Nick和Jordan见完面后的晚上，他回到西卵发现Gatsby的豪宅灯火通明，但里面却一片寂静。Gatsby还十分殷勤地邀请他出去玩（很明显地不合时宜），最后Nick似乎察觉到了Gatsby的急不可待，于是马上提出要安排他和Daisy的见面。其实作者在多处细节都透露了Gatsby的急切，以及他如何尽力压制自己的冲动而不至于显得过于唐突，我们来看一看其中比较有意思的一处——

💧**Clue 1**: Gatsby is eager to show Daisy his mansion and wealth.



**Evidence 1**: Two o’clock and the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with light, which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires.

半夜两点钟了，而半岛的那整个一角照得亮堂堂的，光线照在灌木丛上好像是假的，又照在路旁电线上映出细细的一长条一长条的闪光。

当时已经夜深了，Gatsby却把所有房间的灯都打开，而在对Nick的解释中他则轻描淡写地说道自己只是随便打开几个房间的灯看一看（"I have been glancing into some of the rooms"）. 这一举动明显是因为他想引起住在对岸的Daisy的注意，但又因为太过急切而用力过猛，导致在旁人看来非常笨拙（awkward）.

Gatsby终于通过Nick取得了一次和Daisy见面的机会，因此他在每一个细节上都无比用心，包括请园工修剪Nick家的草坪，还把几乎一整个温室里的花都搬来了Nick家……但这些都无法掩藏他内心深处的惶恐和紧张，甚至还有点自卑（否则不会费尽心思地想要取悦Daisy）。Nick在环境描写和渲染上也使足了力气——



💧**Clue 2**: The surroundings add to the tension of the meeting.



**Evidence 1**: An hour later the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby, in a white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold-colored tie, hurried in.

一小时以后，大门被人战战兢兢地打开，盖茨比一身白法兰绒西装，银色衬衫，金色领带，慌慌张张跑了进来。

Nick没有直接说Gatsby很紧张，而是写“大门被战战兢兢地打开”。也许是推门的速度很缓慢，中间还有停顿和迟疑，或者发出了嘎吱的声音……光是想到这个场景都让人不禁屏气凝神。



**Evidence 2**: Gatsby looked with vacant eyes...and peering toward the bleared windows from time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking place outside.

盖茨比心不在焉地翻阅着……并且不时朝着模糊的窗户张望，仿佛一系列看不见然而怵目惊心的事件正在外面发生。

房子外面当然没有什么骇人的事情发生，这里其实是反指Gatsby的内心世界正处在动荡不安中。他可能正预想这最坏的结果，或者是回忆起往事无法平复心情。



**Evidence 3**: Aware of the loud beating of my own heart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain.

我意识到自己的心也在扑通扑通跳。外面雨下大了，我伸手把大门关上。

Gatsby进门后转身径直走向起居室，马上这两位旧情人就要见面了。而此刻Nick也感觉到自己的心跳加速，而且外面的雨势越来越大了。这里不仅通过环境来烘托故事的高潮——Gatsby和Daisy的会面，还通过了其他人物的共情增加紧张气氛。

**💧Small Jobs for Kids of All Ages**

**美国小朋友做的“小兼职”**

“I want to get the grass cut,” he said. （他勉强地说："我要让人把草地平整一下。"）

盖茨比对于和黛西的“重逢”何其在意啊，嫌弃上了尼克的草坪。读到这里我先想到了美国剪草坪的青少年们。在美国，很多孩子通过干家务活获得零用钱。除了修剪草坪，美国孩子还通过什么“零工”赚零用钱呢？



\1. Yard Work  庭院工作

如果孩子年纪还太小，不适合修剪草坪，他或许可以帮助房主在每年树叶长得很快的时候做其他的庭院工作：铺盖地膜、种植花卉或种子、拔除杂草。



\2. Paper Route 送报纸

对于早起的小孩子来说，最好的工作就是送早报。有时候觉得送一份日报太浪费时间，也有小孩子选择送周报的工作。



\3. Lifeguarding 救生员

喜欢游泳和在户外度过夏天的孩子，救生员是一份很棒的暑期工作。不过需要提前几个月获取相关信息：这些职位不仅很受欢迎，而且任何想找一份救生员工作的人都需要接受培训，并通过心肺复苏(CPR)的救生员课程。



\4. Lemonade Stand  柠檬水小摊

柠檬水小摊是小朋友们的一次有趣的商业冒险。未来的小企业家们也可以在他的岗位上销售其他饮料甚至零食。



\5. Babysitter  保姆工作

保姆工作全年都有，红十字会为11到15岁的孩子提供保姆课程，培训他们急救知识的几个组织之一。在做保姆之前，孩子需要足够成熟，能够应付小孩子。通常父母是其最好的评判者。



\6. Car Wash 洗车

小朋友们“经营”自己的洗车店也是零工的很好选择。这是一项能够享受户外的阳光，淋湿衣物，玩水龙带——而且不怕辛苦的工作。



\7. Dog Walker 遛狗

狗一年到头都需要外出锻炼，暑期孩子们有额外的时间和它们散步或玩耍。家里有宠物的孩子更有可能喜欢照料狗，任何一个年纪足够的孩子都可以做这项工作。



美国的孩子在成长期间会做诸如此类的社会实践，可能也是他们看起来较同龄人成熟的原因之一吧~

**Amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical decency established itself.**

**Gatsby got himself into a shadow and, while Daisy and I talked, looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with tense, unhappy eyes.**

### 背景知识

**💧1. Immanuel Kant  伊曼努尔·康德**

So I stared at it, like Kant at his church steeple, for half an hour. （于是我盯着它看了半个小时，好像康德盯着他的教堂尖塔一样。）

伊曼努尔·康德(1724 - 1804)，德国哲学家。康德是启蒙运动（The Enlightenment）时期最后一位主要哲学家，是德国思想界的代表人物。他调和了勒内·笛卡尔（René Descartes）的理性主义与弗朗西斯·培根（Francis Bacon）的经验主义，被认为是继苏格拉底、柏拉图和亚里士多德后，西方最具影响力的思想家之一。

康德有其自成一派的思想系统，并且有为数不少的著作，其中核心的三大著作被合称为“三大批判”，即《纯粹理性批判》、《实践理性批判》和《判断力批判》，这三部作品有系统地分别阐述他的知识学、伦理学和美学思想。

《纯粹理性批判》尤其得到学术界重视，标志着哲学研究的主要方向由本体论转向认识论，是西方哲学（Western philosophy）史上划时代的巨著，被视为近代哲学的开端。此外，康德在宗教哲学、法律哲学和历史哲学方面也有重要论著。

康德又以思考时凝视教堂尖顶而闻名，所以此处尼克说他凝视尖顶思考就像康德一样。



**💧2. Merton College 默顿学院**



As Gatsby closed the door of “the Merton College Library.” I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into ghostly laughter.（当盖茨比关上"默顿学院图书室"的门时，我可以发誓我听到了那个戴猫头鹰眼镜的人突然发出了鬼似的笑声。）

这里就是第三章提到过的图书馆了，尼克在得知盖茨比真的去过牛津大学以后，在这里也用了牛津藏书丰富的默顿学院来比喻。

### 课文理解

在似乎激烈的一番谈话后（Nick没在房子里所以不知道具体发生了什么），Gatsby和Daisy之间的尴尬气氛缓解了不少。正好这时候天也放晴了，大家的心情都变得十分愉悦，于是Gatsby便主动提出邀请Daisy和Nick参观他的房子。但是在这之前，Gatsby的很多反应让大家都感觉到了难为情，这也暴露出了他在情感上其实非常不成熟，我们来回顾一下细节——



💧**Clue 1**: Gatsby is emotionally immature.



**Evidence 1**: “We haven’t met for many years,” said Daisy, her voice as matter-of-fact as it could ever be. “Five years next November.”

"我们多年不见了。"黛西说，她的声音尽可能地平板。"到十一月整整五年。"



Gatsby对时间的精确让Daisy和Nick都瞠目结舌。Nick是这么形容的：The automatic quality of Gatsby’s answer set us all back at least another minute. "The automatic quality of Gatsby's answer"指Gatsby的回答就像是机器一样自动发出来的，而且让他和Daisy都愣了足足有一分钟的时间。

Gatsby一定是从和Daisy分开的那一天就开始算着时间，这种精确来自于他对Daisy持续而强烈的渴望，但他的这种浪漫落在现实里就变成了一种不合时宜。所以他在丝毫没有考虑场合以及此时Daisy的感受的情况下，就迫不及待地脱口而出，造成气氛极度尴尬。



**Evidence 2**: “You’re acting like a little boy,” I broke out impatiently. “Not only that, but you’re rude. Daisy’s sitting in there all alone.”

"你的行动像一个小孩，"我不耐烦地发作说，"不但如此，你也很没礼貌。黛西孤零零一个人坐在那里面。"



这一幕发生在Nick找借口逃离现场后，Gatsby一下无比慌张地跟着Nick来了厨房，结果引来了Nick的一番指责（平时看起来好好先生的Nick也被Gatsby气坏了），直接说他就像一个小孩（a little boy）. 虽然只是一个很小的细节，但其实也暗示了Gatsby自始至终的行为都有某种幼稚性。

从本书开篇，Nick都在强调Gatsby身上的理想主义特质：他一直在追求的只是一个虚无缥缈的梦，他的希望只是建立在对过去的美好幻想和怀缅上。因此在面对现实的时候，他往往无法认清当前的形势和条件，只是一心一意地按照自己的想法为人行事。而这样带来的后果一定是毁灭性的。

接下来我们看一看环境描写，尤其光的变化是如何反应人物情绪的——



💧**Clue 2**: The emotions of the characters are implied by the light.



**Evidence 1**: He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of exultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little room.

他简直是光芒四射。虽然没有任何表示欣喜的言语姿势，一种新的幸福感从他身上散发出来，充塞了那间小屋子。

这时候Gatsby和Daisy已经结束了他们在屋子里的单独谈话，Nick看到的一幕是Daisy满脸泪痕，而Gatsby则仿佛全身都散发着光芒。可以猜想Gatsby向Daisy坦白了自己为她做的一切，并且当看到Daisy留下眼泪的时候，他就确定了Daisy一定对自己还心存念想，所以他瞬间充满了自信。

**Evidence 2**: “My house looks well, doesn’t it?” he demanded. “See how the whole front of it catches the light.”

"我的房子很好看，是不是？"他问道，"你瞧它整个正面映照着阳光。"

Gatsby带Daisy和Nick参观自己的房子的时候也是一副得意洋洋的样子，整个人都神清气爽起来，和之前的僵硬无措完全不同。所以这里不仅是指房子面朝阳光 ，同时暗示Gatsby的心里也是一片光明，充满了希望。

When a man loves you, he also wants you to be successful in whatever you choose to do. He is your biggest fan and most vocal cheerleader. He believes in you and what you can accomplish. He lets everyone know how awesome you are.

当一个男人爱你的时候，他也希望你无论做什么都能成功。他是你最忠实的粉丝，也是最直言不讳的啦啦队长。他相信你和你所能完成的事情。他想让每个人都知道你有多棒。



\3. He protects you

他会保护你

A man places himself between danger and that which he loves. He shields you not just from physical harm, but also emotional traumas. Always vigilant and always on guard, he is ready at a moment’s notice to place himself in harm’s way. He does not raise his hands against those he loves. It would never cross his mind.

男人把自己置于危险和他所爱的人之间。他不仅保护你不受身体伤害，也保护你不受精神创伤。他时刻保持警惕，时刻处于戒备状态，随时准备将自己置于危险之中。他永远不会攻击他所爱的人。



\4. He steps up

他会挺身而出

When times are tough or there is a tough decision to make, a man steps up and takes action. He does not shift the responsibility to others. He takes responsibility. He makes any sacrifice necessary. His personal comforts and safety are secondary considerations. When things go wrong, he takes the blame and the responsibility for making things right again.

当时局艰难或需要作出艰难决定时，男人会挺身而出，采取行动。他不把责任推卸给别人。他负责。他会做出任何必要的牺牲。他个人的安全才是次要的考虑因素。当事情出错时，他会承担责任，让事情重新回到正轨。



\5. He values your opinion

他重视你的想法

When a man loves you, your opinions matter to him. What you think the two of you should paint the bedroom matters to him. Your opinions on all things great and small are important to him.

当男人爱你时，你的意见对他很重要。你认为你们俩应该把卧室漆成什么样子对他很重要。你对大事小事的看法对他都很重要。



\6. He listens

他愿意倾听你

When you speak, he stops what he is doing to listen to you. What you have to say is important to him, even if it is trivial day-to-day stuff. He pays attention to you because you are the most important person in his world.

当你说话时，他会停下正在做的事听你说话。你要说的对他来说很重要，即使是日常琐事。他关注你是因为你是他很重要的人。



\7. He remembers

他记得

He remembers things like your favorite color, how you like your coffee or what types of books you are into. He remembers because you are important to him. It may seem trivial to you, but to him, you are the focus of his world. He is your biggest fan and remembering how you like your ice cream is just natural.

他会记得一些小事，比如你最喜欢的颜色，你喜欢的咖啡，或者说你喜欢什么类型的书。他记得这些是因为你对他很重要。对你来说，这似乎微不足道，但对他来说，你是他世界的焦点。他是你最忠实的粉丝，记住你有多喜欢冰淇淋是自然而然的。

**Finally we came to Gatsby’s own apartment, a bedroom and a bath, and an Adam study, where we sat down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall.**

**He hadn’t once ceased looking at Daisy, and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes.**

**Now, in the reaction, he was running down like an overwound clock.**

**Recovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and his shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high.**

**“I’ve got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.”**

**He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one, before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel, which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in many-colored disarray.**

**While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher — shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange, and monograms of Indian blue.**

**Suddenly, with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily.**

**“They’re such beautiful shirts,” she sobbed, her voice muffled in the thick folds.**

**“If it wasn’t for the mist we could see your home across the bay,” said Gatsby.**

**“You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock.”**

**Daisy put her arm through his abruptly, but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said.**

**It had seemed as close as a star to the moon.**

**Now it was again a green light on a dock.**

**His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one.**

**I began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects in the half darkness.**

**A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting costume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk.**

**“Who’s this?” “That? That’s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.”**

**The name sounded faintly familiar.**

**“He’s dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.”**

**There was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the bureau — Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly — taken apparently when he was about eighteen.**

**“I adore it,” exclaimed Daisy.**

**“The pompadour! You never told me you had a pompadour — or a yacht.”**

**“Look at this,” said Gatsby quickly.**

**“Here’s a lot of clippings — about you.” They stood side by side examining it.**

**I was going to ask to see the rubies when the phone rang, and Gatsby took up the receiver.**

**“Yes. . . . well, I can’t talk now. . . . I can’t talk now, old sport. . . . I said a small town. . . . he must know what a small town is. . . . well, he’s no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small town. . . . ”**

**He rang off.**

**“Come here quick!” cried Daisy at the window.**

**The rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west, and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea.**

**“Look at that,” she whispered, and then after a moment: “I’d like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around.”**

**I tried to go then, but they wouldn’t hear of it; perhaps my presence made them feel more satisfactorily alone.**

**“I know what we’ll do,” said Gatsby, “we’ll have Klipspringer play the piano.”**

**He went out of the room calling “Ewing!” and returned in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man, with shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blond hair.**

> ==scanty英 ['skæntɪ] 美 [ˈskænti] adj. 缺乏的；吝啬的；仅有的；稀疏的==

**He was now decently clothed in a “sport shirt,” open at the neck, sneakers, and duck trousers of a nebulous hue.**

**“Did we interrupt your exercises?” inquired Daisy politely.**

**“I was asleep,” cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment. “That is, I’d been asleep. Then I got up.. ..”**

**“Klipspringer plays the piano,” said Gatsby, cutting him off. “Don’t you, Ewing, old sport?”**

**“I don’t play well. I don’t — I hardly play at all. I’m all out of prac ——”**

**“We’ll go down-stairs,” interrupted Gatsby.**

**He flipped a switch. The gray windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light.**

**In the music-room Gatsby turned ona solitary lamp beside the piano.**

**He lit Daisy’s cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her on a couch far across the room,where there was no light save what the gleaming floor bounced in from the hall.**

**When Klipspringer had played The Love Nest, he turned around on the bench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom.**

**“I’m all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldn’t play. I’m all out ofprac ——”**

**“Don’t talk so much, old sport,” commanded Gatsby. “Play!”**

**“In the morning, In the evening, Ain’t we got fun——”**

**Outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the Sound.**

**All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric trains, men-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New York.**

**It was the hour of a profound human change, and excitement was generating on the air.**

**“One thing’s sure and nothing’s surer The rich get richer and the poor get— children. In the meantime, In between time——”**

**As I went over to say good-by I saw that the expression of bewilderment had come back into Gatsby’s face, as though a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness.**

> ==bewilderment英 [,bɪ'wɪldəmənt] 美 [bɪˈwɪldərmənt] n. 困惑；迷乱；慌张==

**Almost five years! There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams — not through her own fault, but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion.**

**It had gone beyond her, beyond everything.**

**His hand took hold of hers, and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward her with a rush of emotion.**

### 背景知识

**💧1. Adam style 亚当风格** 

Finally we came to Gatsby’s own apartment, a bedroom and a bath, and an Adam study. （最后我们来到盖茨比本人的套间，包括一间卧室、一间浴室和一间小书房。）

Gatsby的这间书房是亚当风格。这种风格是乔治亚风格的发展与升华，在欧洲和美国东北部流行，它吸取了亚当兄弟（Robert Adam and James Adam）对意大利文艺复兴风格的研究成果。与乔治亚风格相比，屋檐齿饰加长，正门上方加了一个半圆形或椭圆形气窗，墙面窗户有装饰窗修饰。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/7e44bf50e48e87c3fd57641e52f01856-sz_123994.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



亚当风格的典型特征是将装饰性新哥特式细节与经典框架相结合，而所谓的“埃及”和“伊特鲁里亚”（Etruscan）设计图案是次要特征。

**💧2. The Love Nest & Ain’t we got fun（1920s流行乐曲）**



When Klipspringer had played *The Love Nest*, he turned around on the bench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom. （克利普斯普林格弹完了《爱情的安乐窝》之后，在长凳上转过身来，不高兴地在幽暗中张望着找盖茨比。）

“In the morning, In the evening, Ain’t we got fun——”（"每天早上，每天晚上，《玩得欢畅》……"）



*The Love Nest*和*Ain’t we got fun*这两首来自20世纪20年代的流行歌曲（属于Tin Pan Alley流派）。*The Love Nest* 来自是著名作曲家Lou Hirsch的音乐剧《玛丽》（*Mary*）. *The Love Nest*是说一所在农场的攀有藤蔓和玫瑰但充满爱和温暖的小房子，要好过金碧辉煌的宫殿。讽刺的是，Gatsby此刻正在向Daisy炫耀他的豪华住所，意在以其魅力使她折服。



*Ain’t we got fun*在1920年代是首次发行的狐步舞曲子。*Ain’t we got fun*是具有讽刺意味的副歌，词作者在勾勒一对逐渐陷入贫困的各种方式，一遍又一遍地重复这句话。听到这首歌之后，困惑的表情又回到了Gatsby脸上（I saw that the expression of bewilderment had come back into Gatsby’s face），他好像又在怀疑此刻眼前的幸福了，作者也在这里埋下了伏笔。

### 课文理解

第5章的内容不多，但起着非常关键的作用——推动整个故事情节往高潮（Climax）发展，我们把这部分叫做剧情上升（Rising Action）. 因此前4章属于剧情介绍（Exposition），主要描述故事的背景、场景及人物，并且引入矛盾（Conflict）. 



而在第5章中，随着Daisy和Gatsby的正式重逢，矛盾更加凸显出来，但此时仍没有推向顶点，因此给后面的情节发展留下了悬念（Suspense）. 今天提供的两条线索其实也是作者在这部分埋下的伏笔，对于把握接下来的故事走向非常重要哦~



首先，第一条线索，暗示了最后Daisy为什么还是没有选择Gatsby——



💧**Clue 1**:  Daisy is much more impressed by the display of materialism.



**Evidence 1**: “They’re such beautiful shirts,” she sobbed, her voice muffled in the thick folds. “It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such — such beautiful shirts before.”

"这些衬衫这么美，"她呜咽地说，她的声音在厚厚的衣堆里闷哑了，"我看了很伤心，因为我从来没见过这么——这么美的衬衫。"

Gatsby满心欢喜地向Daisy展示他的家居摆设以及一切奢华至极的物件，电影里面有一个真实还原的镜头——Gatsby把一件一件衬衫扔在Daisy面前，结果Daisy感动地大哭，理由是她从来没有见过这么漂亮的衣服。这一幕其实也非常讽刺，因为让她感动的并不是Gatsby的真心和努力，而是他展现的财富和浮华。

与之形成对比的是另一幅画面，Daisy对于Gatsby日夜凝视的对岸的绿光丝毫没有在意——



**Evidence 2**: “If it wasn’t for the mist we could see your home across the bay,” said Gatsby. “You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock.”

"要不是有雾，我们可以看见海湾对面你家的房子，"盖茨比说，"你家码头的尽头总有一盏通宵不灭的绿灯。"



Nick和Daisy都没有对Gatsby的这句话给予回应，似乎只有Gatsby一个人沉浸在里面。此刻Gatsby的心情应该是波涛汹涌的，如此隐忍的秘密就这样脱口而出了，他一定在等待Daisy的揣测，比如“Gatsby怎么知道我家码头的灯总是通宵不灭”“他是为了什么才会整夜守望”……这些想法是否曾经在她的脑海里徘徊，或者即便只是一闪而过？

另一个重要的线索则是暗示Gatsby的梦并不是切实的，而且是永远无法触达的——



💧**Clue 2**: Gatsby's dream is not indeed real and viable.



**Evidence 1**: Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one.

现在它又是码头上的一盏绿灯了。他的神奇的宝物已经减少了一件。

当Gatsby向Dasiy暗示他每天都在守望她家码头上的绿灯但没有得到回应时，紧接而来的就是绿灯仿佛在一瞬间失去了它的魔力（count of enchanted objects表明了Gatsby把他的幻想和渴望寄托在了各样事物上）。绿灯之所以不再迷人，不仅是因为此刻Daisy就在他的身边，所以他不再需要凝望绿灯来幻想Daisy，更是在暗示当愿望和现实相交的那一刻，结果可能是失望。



这种落差感，按照Nick的话来说，并不是由Daisy本身带来的，而是Gatsby本身的幻梦过于强大——



**Evidence 2**: There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams — not through her own fault, but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion.

那天下午一定有过一些时刻，黛西远不如他的梦想——并不是由于她本人的过错，而是由于他的幻梦有巨大的活力。



tumble short of也就是fall short of, 表示“达不到（目的，期望，标准）”；这里直接表明了令Gatsby着迷的，不仅仅是这个人，更是Daisy这个名字所代表的一切。他在Daisy身上寄托了对美好过去、名利金钱、个人奋斗的种种愿望和憧憬。所以当Daisy作为一个实在的人走进现实，Gatsby可能突然就感受到了一种幻灭性。

在本章的最后，两个人的这次会面戛然而止——Then I went out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them there together. Nick选择了置身事外，这次的会面会对他们彼此的生活产生什么样的影响？Gatsby的下一步计划是什么？我们继续期待之后的故事。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧1920s Mens Hairstyles**

**1920年代的男士发型**

“I adore it,” exclaimed Daisy. “The pompadour! You never told me you had a pompadour — or a yacht.”（"我真爱这张相片，"黛西嚷嚷道，"这个笔直向后梳的发型！你从来没告诉我你留过笔直向后梳的发型，也没告诉我你有一艘游艇。"）今天我们来看看20世纪20年代的男人一般都留什么样的发型吧~

Pompadour是一种将头发全部往上梳，往侧面梳的造型，将脸部轮廓完全露出来；最大的特点是前额部分的头发会往上后方梳得很高，留个蓬蓬的弧度。该发型灵感取自法国蓬帕杜夫人（Madame de Pompadour），这种发型就是由她开始推行的。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/03a0dd377a487f50ed2eb73c17a445b6-sz_69979.png)



在20世纪20年代之前，这样向上梳起的发型是当时非常流行的女士的发型，通常还在前额上留一绺卷发。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/5900fa8f5b098c0e1e550c7aba626801-sz_114357.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



留这种发型的男性把前面的头发向上梳起，让头发看起来犹如飙过车的流线走向与厚度。20世纪50年代，Pompadour发型在男性乡村摇滚乐艺术家和演员中风靡一时，其中包括马龙·白兰度（Marlon Brando）和詹姆斯·迪恩（James Dean）.

20世纪后期，著名的乡村摇滚乐歌手布莱恩·塞瑟（Brian Krause）留的也是这种发型。另外，还有一些拉丁式的蓬帕杜发型，它们与欧洲和阿根廷的探戈（Tango）时尚潮流关系更密切，偶尔也与20世纪后期的其他一些音乐风格有关。

在20世纪20年代，男人几乎总是戴着帽子。尽管这一潮流随着年轻的大学男生逐渐褪去，但“帽子男”和“没帽子男”（hatted and unhatted men）的发型都是一样的。这样的话，发型适合扁平、光滑、有光泽的中等长度头发。这种类似头盔的男子发型为这种发型起了几个绰号，如“漆皮头”（“Patent Leather” ）或“头盔头”（“helmet head”）.



为了得到光滑的外观，男士们使用了一种名为“发蜡”（Brilliantine）的产品。它是油性的，接触到任何东西都会产生粘稠的残渣（slimy residue）. 20世纪20年代的版本并不是为了保持一个形状，而是为了保持平滑和平整。有时也会用便宜的凡士林（petroleum jelly）代替昂贵的发蜡。



一旦涂上了发蜡，男人就会用三种流行的方法之一将头发分开。首先是所有的头发都是直的（all straight back-tops）——头顶梳过头顶，两边梳过头顶，然后斜着梳到头顶的后面。第二种选择是直接在中间分开（part directly in the center），或者稍微偏离中间（slightly off center- whichever）——以哪个分开最帅气为好。第三个选择是一边更深一些（deeper part on one side）.

所以从1920年到1929年男士的发型几乎没有变化，最显著的变化是人们仍在使用发蜡，但数量减少了。现代也有很多男士喜欢留这种复古的发型，学习到了，下次可以洋气地跟托尼老师说给剪一个Pompadour~

**About this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one morning at Gatsby’s door and asked him if he had anything to say.**

**“Anything to say about what?” inquired Gatsby politely.**

**“Why — any statement to give out.”**

**It transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard Gatsby’s name around his office in a connection which he either wouldn’t reveal or didn’t fully understand.**

**Contemporary legends such as the “underground pipe-line to Canada” attached themselves to him,**

**and there was one persistent story that he didn’t live in a house at all, but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly up and down the Long Island shore.**

**Just why these inventions were a source of satisfaction to James Gatzof North Dakota, isn’t easy to say.**

**James Gatz — that was really, or atleast legally, his name.**

**He had changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that witnessed the beginning of his career — when he saw Dan Cody’s yacht drop anchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior.**

> ==insidious adj. 隐伏的,潜在的,暗中为害的==

**It was James Gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants,**

**but it was already Jay Gatsby who borrowed a rowboat, pulled out to the Tuolomee, and informed Cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour.**

**I suppose he’d had the name ready for a long time, even then.**

**His parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people — his imagination had never really accepted them as his parents at all.**

**The truth was that Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of himself.**

**He was a son of God — a phrase which, if it means anything, means just that — and he must be about His Father’s business, the service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty.**

**So he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.**

**For over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of Lake Superior as a clam-digger and a salmon-fisher or in any other capacity that brought him food and bed.**

**His brown, hardening body lived naturally through the half-fierce, half-lazy work of the bracing days.**

**He knew women early, and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous of them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of the others because they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming self-absorbtion he took for granted.**

> <font color=red>He knew women early, / and since they spoiled him / he became contemptuous of them, / of young virgins / because they were ignorant, / of the others / because they were hysterical about things / which in his overwhelming self-absorbtion / he took for granted.</font>

> 他很早就了解女人，并且由于女人们都过分宠爱他，他倒瞧不起她们。他瞧不起年轻的处女，因为她们愚昧无知；他也瞧不起其他女人，因为她们容易对一些事情歇斯底里，而在他那势不可挡的自负的心里，那些事都是理所当然的。

>
> *self-absorption是Gatsby自年轻就有的一个性格特征，他做一切事的目的其实都是寻求自己的开心（to bring himself pleasure）. 这也暗示了他对Daisy的追求其实有相当一部分都来源于他“自恋心理”（narcissism）.

**But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot.**

**Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace.**

**For a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy’s wing.**

**An instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before, to the small Lutheran college of St.Olaf in southern Minnesota.**

**He stayed there two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor’s work with which he was to pay his way through.**

**Then he drifted back to Lake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the day that Dan Cody’s yacht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore.**

**Cody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields, of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since seventy-five.**

**He had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five years when he turned up as James Gatz’s destiny at Little Girls Point.**

**To the young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck, the yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world.**

**I suppose he smiled at Cody — he had probably discovered that people liked him when he smiled.**

**At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of them elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick and extravagantly ambitious.**

**A few days later he took him to Duluth and bought him a blue coat, six pair of white duck trousers, and a yachting cap.**

**And when the Tuolomee left for the West Indies and the Barbary Coast Gatsby left too.**

**He was employed in a vague personal capacity — while he remained with Cody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary,**

**and even jailor, for Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be about, and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and more trust in Gatsby.**

> ==contingency英 [kən'tɪndʒ(ə)nsɪ] 美 [kənˈtɪndʒənsi] n. 偶然性；[安全] 意外事故；可能性==

**It might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye came on board one night in Boston and a week later Dan Cody inhospitably died.**

**It was indirectly due to Cody that Gatsby drank so little.**

**Sometimes in the course of gay parties women used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he formed the habit of letting liquor alone.**

**And it was from Cody that he inherited money — a legacy of twenty-five thousand dollars.**

**He didn’t get it.**

**He never understood the legal device that was used against him, but what remained of the millions went intact to Ella Kaye.**

**He was left with his singularly appropriate education; the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the substantiality of a man.**

**Moreover he told it to me at a time of confusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and nothing about him.**

**So I take advantage of this short halt, while Gatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of misconceptions away.**

**It was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs.**

### 背景知识

**💧Lake Superior** **苏必利尔湖**

When he saw Dan Cody’s yacht drop anchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior.（当时他看见丹·科迪先生的游艇在苏必利尔湖上最险恶的沙洲上抛锚）。

苏必利尔湖（Lake Superior）是世界上面积最大的淡水湖（freshwater lake），1622年为法国殖民者所发现，湖名取自法语Supérieur（索菲莉尔），意为“上湖”。该湖为美国和加拿大共有，被加拿大的安大略省与美国的明尼苏达州（Minnesota）、威斯康星州（Wisconsin）和密歇根州（Michigan）所环绕。

湖面东西长616千米，南北最宽处257千米，湖面平均海拔180米，水面积82414㎞²，最大深度405米。湖岸线长3000千米，沿岸森林密布，北岸曲折多湖湾。苏比略湖周围的许多城镇是采矿区、加工区或是航运据点。苏比略湖崎岖的湖岸与荒野吸引观光客与冒险家，所以旅游业是苏比略湖附近人口稀少的城镇的重要产业。



**💧Plato 柏拉图**

The truth was that Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of himself.（实际上长岛西卵的杰伊·盖茨比来自他对自己的柏拉图式的理念。）柏拉图式的理念是说Gatsby区分了他的“真实”自我（以他的合法名字），和他的“理想”自我。“Gatsby”才是他真正想成为的人。

柏拉图（Plato），古希腊伟大的哲学家，也是全部西方哲学乃至整个西方文化最伟大的哲学家和思想家之一。

柏拉图和其老师苏格拉底（Socrates），学生亚里士多德（Aristotle）并称为希腊三贤。另有其创造或发展的概念包括：柏拉图思想、柏拉图主义（Platonism）、柏拉图式爱情（Platonic love）等。

柏拉图才思敏捷，研究广泛，著述颇丰。以他的名义流传下来的著作有40多篇，另有13封书信。柏拉图的主要哲学思想都是通过对话的形式记载下来的。在柏拉图的对话中，有很多是以苏格拉底之名进行的谈话，因此很难区分哪些是苏格拉底的思想，哪些是柏拉图的思想。

### 课文理解

第6章首先通过Nick的口吻揭开了Gatsby的真实背景，包括他如何改名换姓以及跟随一个叫做Cody的拓荒大亨上了游艇，但他最后并没有得到本该属于他的遗产 。这些事迹都是很久以后Gatsby才告诉Nick的。

而之所以写在这，除了按照Nick说的是为了破除关于Gatsby的那些完全不切实际的传言（with the idea of exploding those first wild rumors about hisantecedents, which weren’t even faintly true）, 同时也形成了剧情上的一个小反转——第5章是梦想的第一次实现，而第6章则是戳破这个梦想里的某些幻象，提前预告了结尾的唏嘘。



💧**Clue 1**: Gatsby is born to a humble family and poorly educated.

**Evidence 1**: His parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people — his imagination had never really accepted them as his parents at all.

他的父母是碌碌无为的庄稼人——-他的想象中根本从来没有真正承认他们是自己的父母。



**Evidence 2**: An instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before, to the small Lutheran college of St. Olaf in southern Minnesota.

几个月以前，在一种追求他未来的光荣的本能的促使下，他前往明尼苏达州南部路德教的小圣奥拉夫学院。



大家是否还记得在第4章中，当Gatsby和Nick一起去纽约吃午餐的时候，他告诉Nick自己出身于贵族：“I am the son of some wealthy people in the Middle West — all dead now.” 还强调了自己是牛津大学毕业的：“I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford, because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years.”

但是这些现在都被推翻了，并且是由他自己亲口完成的。但Nick的目的不只是要揭示出Gatsby的确在谎话连篇地捏造自己的过往，而是把读者的焦点转到Gatsby做这些事情的动机上——



💧**Clue 2**: Gatsby builds himself on a completely glorious but unreal illusion.



**Evidence 1**: He was a son of God — a phrase which, if it means anything, means just that — and he must be about His Father’s business, the service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty.

他是上帝的儿子——这个称号，如果有什么意义的话，就是字面的意思——因此他必须为他的天父效命，献身于一种博大、庸俗、华而不实的美。



Gatsby最大的幻梦并不是Daisy，而是他为自己建造的一个近乎光荣和完美的身份。比如他在17岁的时候，有一年多的时间都只是在苏必利尔湖南岸奔波，要么捕鲑鱼，要么捞蛤蜊，最后只能挣得足够支付食宿的钱。

但在他的想象美化下，他把自己比作是上帝的儿子——耶稣，并且把自己这段打渔的经历形容成“为了上帝所作的工”（His Father's business），呼应耶稣在海边选召门徒并且和门徒一起“打渔”（“打渔”在基督教里的比喻含义为“布道并且传召信徒”）。



**Evidence 2**: For a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy’s wing.

有一阵子这些幻梦为他的想象力提供了一个发泄的途径：它们令人满意地暗示现实是不真实的，它们表明世界的磐石是牢牢地建立在仙女的翅膀上的。



“That the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy's wing”说明Gatsby的世界观其实都是建立在幻想之上的，并且这种“牢固性”是基于他那种强大的、必须要有发泄途径的想象力。这里呼应了第5章结尾的内容：...but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything.

 

这种由于自我的膨胀和幻想带来的力量究竟会产生什么样的毁灭性？Nick给我们留下了悬念。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧漂流的 drift**

Then he drifted back to Lake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the day. （后来他东漂西荡又回到了苏必利尔湖，那天他还在找点什么活儿干的时候。）Gatsby年少时的生活并不稳定，他在四处漂泊时遇到了Dan Cody，这才短暂地稳定下来。今天我们来学习drift的习语吧~



\1. drift back

慢慢地向某人或某事移动，尤指浮在水面上时

例句：The tubes were all scattered across the pool, but now they're drifting back to the steps.

管子都散落在游泳池里，但现在它们又飘回到台阶上。



\2. get the drift of something

理解某事的大意

例句：I knew enough German to get the drift of this article. I don't get the drift of what you're trying to tell me.

我懂的德语足够多，能听懂这篇文章的大意。我不明白你想告诉我什么。

 

\3. drift with (something)

①被某物（如风或水）推动时缓慢而无明确方向地移动

例句：It's more relaxing to just let the boat drift with the waves.

让船随波漂流更令人放松。

 

②被他人的决定或感觉所左右

例句：When will you stop being such a follower,drifting with all of your friends' stupid ideas?

你什么时候才会停止追随你所有朋友的愚蠢想法呢?



\4. drift off to sleep 

逐渐入睡

例句：I really do want to watch this movie with you, but I'm so tired that I keep drifting off to sleep.

我很想和你们一起去看这部电影，但是我实在太累了，我几乎要睡着了。

 

\5. drift away

经过一段时间的亲密之后，逐渐与某人疏远

例句：Andrea and I never had a big fight or anything, we just drifted away from each other over the years, and now I hardly ever see her.

Andrea 和我从来没有大吵过架什么的，我们只是多年来渐渐疏远，现在我几乎见不着她了。

**They were a party of three on horseback — Tom and a man named Sloane and a pretty woman in a brown riding-habit, who had been there previously.**

**“I’m delighted to see you,” said Gatsby, standing on his porch. “I’m delighted that you dropped in.”**

**As though they cared!**

**“Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar.”**

**He walked around the room quickly,ringing bells.**

**“I’ll have something to drink for you in just a minute.”**

**He was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there.**

**But he would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing in a vague way that that was all they came for. Mr. Sloane wanted nothing.**

**A lemonade? No, thanks.**

**A little champagne? Nothing at all, thanks. . . . I’m sorry ——**

**“Did you have a nice ride?”**

**“Very good roads around here.”**

**“I suppose the automobiles ——” “Yeah.”**

**“I believe we’ve met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan.”**

**“Oh, yes,” said Tom, gruffly polite, but obviously not remembering. “So we did. I remember very well.”**

**“About two weeks ago.”**

**“That’s right. You were with Nick here.”**

**“I know your wife,” continued Gatsby, almost aggressively.**

**“That so?” Tom turned to me.**

**“You live near here, Nick?” “Next door.” “That so?”**

**Mr. Sloane didn’t enter into the conversation, but lounged back haughtily in his chair; the woman said nothing either — until unexpectedly, after two highballs, she became cordial.**

**“We’ll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby,” she suggested. “What do you say?”**

**“Certainly; I’d be delighted to have you.”**

**“Be ver’ nice,” said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude.**

**“Well — think ought to be starting home.”**

**“Please don’t hurry,” Gatsby urged them.**

**He had control of himself now, and he wanted to see more of Tom.**

**“Why don’t you — why don’t you stay for supper? I wouldn’t be surprised if some other people dropped in from New York.”**

**“You come to supper with me,” said the lady enthusiastically.**

**“Both of you.” This included me.**

**Mr. Sloane got to his feet.**

**“Come along,” he said — but to her only.**

**“I mean it,” she insisted. “I’d love to have you. Lots of room.”**

**Gatsby looked at me questioningly.**

**He wanted to go, and he didn’t see that Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn’t.**

**“I’m afraid I won’t be able to,” I said.**

**“Well, you come,” she urged, concentrating on Gatsby.**

**Mr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear.**

**“We won’t be late if we start now,” she insisted aloud.**

**“I haven’t got a horse,” said Gatsby.**

**“I used to ride in the army, but I’ve never bought a horse. I’ll have to follow you in my car. Excuse me for just a minute.”**

**The rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady began an impassioned conversation aside.**

> ==impassioned英 [ɪm'pæʃ(ə)nd] 美 [ɪmˈpæʃənd] adj. 充满激情的；感激的==

**“My God, I believe the man’s coming,” said Tom.**

**“Doesn’t he know she doesn’t want him?”**

**“She says she does want him.”**

**“She has a big dinner party and he won’t know a soul there.” He frowned.**

**“I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I may be old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to suit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish.”**

**Suddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted their horses.**

### 背景知识

**💧Fox-trot 狐步舞**

I remember being surprised by his graceful, conservative fox-trot.（我记得我当时看到他跳着优雅的老式狐步舞感到很诧异）

狐步舞起源于美国黑人舞蹈，1914年夏，美国演员哈利·福克斯（Harry fox）从模仿在慢步行走时的动作，得到灵感，设计出了狐步舞这一新的舞蹈形式，从此，狐步舞迅速在全美风行。舞曲4/4拍，每分钟30小节左右。

跳狐步舞时要求身体挺直，膝关节放松，臀部和髋要固定。由于狐步舞的特点是舞步平稳、自由悠闲、动作流畅、行云流水，加上音乐优雅、恬静、婉柔流利，故上身动作多变，大多数采用了反身动作位置，使其舞蹈特性更加文雅，跳舞舞步变化多样，需要舞伴之间配合更加默契，同时狐步舞技术中大量运用了足跟旋转，更加突出了舞蹈特性。



**💧Cigar 雪茄**

雪茄，一种烟草（tobacco）制品，由干燥及经过发酵的烟草卷制而成，吸食时把其中一端点燃，然后在另一端用口吸咄，产生烟雾。

雪茄的烟草的主要生产国是：巴西、喀麦隆、古巴、多米尼加共和国、洪都拉斯、印尼、墨西哥、尼加拉瓜和美国以及东南亚的菲律宾。

从前的绅士会在家中设有专门的空间来享受“雪茄时间”（Cigar time）. 当然，这也许只是绅士时代的旧风，战场上的卡斯特罗（Fidel Castro）和大船上的海明威（Ernest Miller Hemingway）同样可以享受到抽雪茄时的沉静。

### 课文理解

Tom和另外两个同行的东卵人骑马经过Gatsby家顺道拜访，结果Tom在知道Gatsby竟然认识自己的妻子Daisy后非常不悦，于是在下周的派对上他和Daisy一起出现了。这次的派对和以往的不同之处在于，它的真正目标——Daisy终于现身了。

Gatsby既殷勤又得意地向Daisy和Tom介绍出席派对的社会名流，比如电影大导演和明星，以显示自己的派对有多么高级。但不要忘记了，从Tom第一次拜访Gatsby家起，他对Gatsby的鄙夷就已经显而易见了——



💧**Clue 1**: The East Eggers are evidently contempt at the West Eggers.



**Evidence 1**: We’ll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby,” she suggested. “What do you say?” “Certainly; I’d be delighted to have you.” “Be ver’ nice,” said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. “Well — think ought to be starting home.”

"我们都来参加你下次的晚会，盖茨比先生，"她提议说，"你看好不好？" "当然好了。你们能来，我太高兴了。" "那很好吧，"斯隆先生毫不承情地说，"呃——我看该回家了。"



**Evidence 2**: “My God, I believe the man’s coming,” said Tom. “Doesn’t he know she doesn’t want him?” “She says she does want him.” “She has a big dinner party and he won’t know a soul there.” He frowned.

"我的天，我相信这家伙真的要来，"汤姆说，"难道他不知道她并不要他来吗？" "她说她要他来的嘛。" "她要举行盛大的宴会，他在那儿一个人都不会认得的。"他皱皱眉头。

Mr. Sloane和Tom的语气里都透露着明显的鄙夷和不满。尤其在Tom开来，Gatsby丝毫没有自知之明。尽管Gatsby有这样一座华丽的豪宅，但西卵人的身份决定了他并不属于Tom所处的上流社会。

 

除此之外，Tom对Gatsby和Daisy相识的态度也暴露出了他的虚伪和两面性——



💧**Clue 2**: Tom is a hypocritical and double-standard person.



**Evidence 1**: “By God, I may be old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to suit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish.”

"天晓得，也许我的思想太古板，但是这年头女人家到处乱跑，我可看不惯。她们遇上各式各样的怪物。"

看到这里不知道大家有没有想起Tom曾经也对Jordan这样评头论足过：“She’s a nice girl,” said Tom after a moment. “They oughtn’t to let her run around the country this way.”（Chapter 1.6）

而Tom自己却从不收敛地四处带着情妇Myrtle招摇：His acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular restaurants with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting with whomsoever he knew.（Chapter 1.7）

所以Tom说那些太太们跟着别的男人们（crazy fish）乱跑的时候，不也是在说自己就是crazy fish么？

此外作者其实也暗暗地对Tom进行了讽刺：在英文里有这样一句习语：be on (one's) high horse, 指“在道德上居高临下”（to adopt an attitude of moral superiority）. 而当时Tom就是骑着马来的，这里作者暗指Tom should both literally and figuratively "Get off his high horse".

**💧Introduce Friends to Other Friends** 

**如何得体地介绍朋友**



After an instant’s hesitation he added: “the polo player.” “Oh no,” objected Tom quickly, “not me.”（踌躇片刻之后，他又补充说，"马球健将。" "不是的，"汤姆连忙否认，"我可不是。"）Gatsby为了显示自己的体面，介绍Tom为马球健将。今天来学习在日常生活中该怎样得体地介绍朋友吧~



\1. Bring your friends together.

If you are at a party or some social gathering, bring your two friends together. 在聚会上或是其他社交场合，首先把两方的朋友都叫在适合介绍和谈话的地方。



预先让对方知道要介绍朋友认识，如果对方尚在犹豫，你可以说：



I really want you to meet my friend Bob. He’s the biggest football fan I know.

我真的很想让你见见我的朋友鲍勃。他是我认识的最大的足球迷。



I’m going to introduce you to this person that I think you’ll like.

我要把你介绍给这个我想你会喜欢的人。



这样可以给对方一个心理预期，也是良好对话甚至友谊的开始。



\2. Make the necessary introductions.

It may be less awkward and more formal if you do the introducing. 当把朋友聚在一起，像Gatsby这样，最好由你来做介绍，可能就不会那么尴尬，反而会更加正式。



介绍时可以说：

Bob, this is Barnaby Smith. Barnaby, this is Bob Robertson.

Bob，这位是Barnaby Smith. Barnaby, 这是Bob Robertson.



除非对方更喜欢别人的昵称，不然的话在介绍时要使用对方的全名哦。



\3. State why you wanted to introduce these two people. 

You should explain your reason and let them know why you thought they would be friends. 朋友们肯定好奇为什么你会介绍他们认识，说清楚介绍他们认识的理由，这样他们对彼此也有个基本的认识，也是接下来谈话的很好起点。



I thought I’d introduce you to each other because you are such big fans of football.

我想我应该介绍你们认识，因为你们都是足球迷。



You’re both new to town so I thought I’d introduce you to each other.

你们俩都是刚来，所以我想把你们介绍给彼此认识。



朋友们都认识了以后，你最好可以一起聊天，避免刚认识的朋友会尴尬或不适。除非你的两个朋友真的很投缘，聊得很投机，否则不要马上离开。

**It was like that.**

**Almost the last thing I remember was standing with Daisy and watching the moving-picture director and his Star.**

**They were still under the white plumtree and their faces were touching except for a pale, thin ray of moonlight between.**

**It occurred to me that he had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this proximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate degree and kiss at her cheek.**

**“I like her,” said Daisy, “I think she’slovely.”**

**But the rest offended her — and inarguably, because it wasn’t a gesture but an emotion.**

**She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented “place” that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village —**

**appalled by its raw vigor that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a short-cut from nothing to nothing.**

**She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand.**

**I sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car.**

**It was dark here in front; only the bright door sent ten square feet of light volleying out into the soft black morning.**

**Sometimes a shadow moved against a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow, an indefinite procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an invisible glass.**

**“Who is this Gatsby anyhow?” demanded Tom suddenly.**

**“Some big bootlegger?”**

> 一个大私酒贩子?

**“Where’d you hear that?” I inquired.**

**“I didn’t hear it. I imagined it. A lot of these newly rich people are just big bootleggers, you know.”**

**“Not Gatsby,” I said shortly.**

**He was silent for a moment.**

**The pebbles of the drive crunched under his feet.**

> 汽车道上的小石子在他脚底下喀嚓作响。

**“Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie together.”**

**A breeze stirred the gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar.**

**“At least they’re more interesting than the people we know,” she said with an effort.**

**“You didn’t look so interested.”**

**“Well, I was.”**

**Tom laughed and turned to me.**

**“Did you notice Daisy’s face when that girl asked her to put her under a cold shower?”**

**Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper, bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again.**

**When the melody rose, her voice broke up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.**

**“That girl hadn’t been invited. They simply force their way in and he’s too polite to object.”**

**“I’d like to know who he is and what he does,” insisted Tom.**

**“I can tell you right now,” she answered.**

**“He owned some drug-stores, a lot of drug-stores. He built them up himself.”**

**The dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive.**

**“Good night, Nick,” said Daisy.**

**Her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps, where Three O’clock in the Morning, a neat, sad little waltz of that year, was drifting out the open door.**

**After all, in the very casualness of Gatsby’s party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from her world.**

**When he came down the steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes were bright and tired.**

**“She didn’t like it,” he said immediately.**

**“Of course she did.” “She didn’t like it,” he insisted.**

**“She didn’t have a good time.”**

**He talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted to recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy.**

**His life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he could find out what that thing was. . . . . . .**

**One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight.**

**They stopped here and turned toward each other.**

**Now it was a cool night with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of the year.**

**The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars.**

**Out of the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees —he could climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.**

**His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own.**

**He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God.**

>
> *“不再像上帝的心灵一样自由驰骋了”可以理解为他的所有隐秘、活跃的想法不再只为他自己所知（the mind of God暗含着“上帝的想法是人不可揣摩的”）。也就是说仿佛只要他亲吻了Daisy, Dasiy就可以知道他的private thoughts.

### 背景知识

**💧1. Menagerie 动物展览**

“Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie together.”（"我说，他一定花了很大的气力才搜罗到这么一大帮牛头马面。"）

megagerie这个词最早出现在17世纪的法国，主要指家禽的豢养（the management of household or domestic stock）. 后来则用来指供贵族们观赏的展览动物园（aristocratic or royal animal collections）, 里面的动物一般是来自异域的品种并且经过了驯养（a collection of captive animals, frequently exotic, kept for display）.

从形式上来说，这种动物展览其实就像现代的动物园。不同的是，这些展览是贵族个人私有的。他们进行展览也仅仅是为了满足好奇心，以及展示自己的财富（exhibition of luxury and curiosity）, 并不是出于进行科学研究或教育的目的（not of scientific and educational interest）.后来meganerie也开始指在英美国家出现的巡回动物展览（travelling animal collections）, 类似于到处进行演出的马戏团。

这里Tom把Gatsby聚会上的客人们形容为meganerie, 其实有双关的含义：第一层采取了meganerie的引申义，也就是指“一群不同寻常、各色各样的 人”（an unusual and varied group of people）; 第二层意思就是暗讽这些人并没有显赫的社会地位，并且行为举止夸张放浪，让人看来十分滑稽可笑（像展览的动物一样）。



💧2. **Euphemism 委婉语**

...appalled by its raw vigor that chafed under the old euphemisms...（厌恶它那不安于陈旧的委婉辞令的粗犷活力）。这里的euphemisims是指属于上流社会的那一套老派的“社交礼仪及用语”。

euphemism在英语中属于一种修辞手法，一般指用委婉，文雅的方法表达粗俗或者避讳的话。比如用pass away来表示die（逝世），on the streets指homeless（无家可归），between jobs指unemploted（待业中）。

大家还知道哪些英文的委婉语也可以在群里分享哦~

### 课文理解

除了那位电影导演和女明星引起了Tom和Daisy的兴趣外，他们对于派对的其他客人和整个氛围都十分不满（客人们喝醉后全无形象，除了大声喧闹外，还有把身旁朋友的头摁在泳池里的）。Daisy直接犀利地说道他们连邀请都没收到就来了（“Lots of people come who haven’t been invited”），而在Tom看来，西卵人不过都是靠做私酒生意发起来的（“A lot of these newly rich people are just big bootleggers, you know.”）

Gatsby知道Daisy玩得并不开心（“She didn’t like it,” he insisted. “She didn’t have a good time.”）但他还没有清醒地意识到（或者选择性忽略了），他们之间的隔阂不只是五年的时间，而是阶级地位的差异，以及性格观念上的鸿沟——



💧**Clue 1**: Daisy is clearly seperated from Gatsby.



**Evidence 1**: But the rest offended her — and inarguably, because it wasn’t a gesture but an emotion.

但是其他的一切她都讨厌——而且是不容置辩的，因为这并不是一种姿态，而是一种感情。

Daisy对West Egg的厌恶是来自心底的（emotion强调是情感上的，而不只是gesture, 也就是具体的行动表现）。但是在这种轻慢放肆的氛围里，有一种Daisy身上所没有的气质，这也是Gatsby最显著的特征——



**Evidence 2**: After all, in the very casualness of Gatsby’s party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from her world.

话说回来，正是在盖茨比的晚会的随随便便的气氛之中，就有她自己的世界中完全没有的种种浪漫的可能性。

这种浪漫是具有魔力的，仿佛只要怀抱希望一切就可以实现： What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside? What would happen now in the dim, incalculable hours? 比如从大门传出来的音乐似乎在呼唤她回到里面去（暗指回到Gatsby痴痴念想的过去），而且仿佛什么可能都会发生（比如Gatsby和Daisy的复合，Daisy为了Gatsby离开Tom）.

但是这种浪漫真的会为Daisy所接受并感动吗？比如Gatsby坚定地相信过去的可以重来，甚至不是重来，而是回到原原本本的过去——



💧**Clue 2**: Gatsby is steadfast in belief that the past can be repeated.



**Evidence 1**: “Can’t repeat the past?” he cried incredulously. “Why of course you can!”

"不能重温旧梦？"他大不以为然地喊道，"哪儿的话，我当然能够！"

Nick提醒Gatsby不要对Dasiy希冀过高：“I wouldn’t ask too much of her,” I ventured.（“如果是我，我不会向她要求那么多”）. 但Gatsby认为他一定能让Daisy重新找到过去的感觉——



**Evidence 2**: I’m going to fix everything just the way it was before,” he said, nodding determinedly. “She’ll see.”

"我要把一切都安排得跟过去一模一样，"他说，一面坚决地点点头，"她会看到的。"

过去或许可以回顾（to revist）, 但果真可以重现（to repeat）吗？Nick在这一章中的叙述口吻充满了焦虑和紧张，结尾的怅惘其实也是一个隐喻：But they made no sound, and what I had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever. 几乎快要想起来的旋律和歌词没有把握住，就再也无法表达了。就像一个眼前触手可得的美梦，还差一步没有实现，就永远错过了。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧How Celebrity Culture Gets Us Psychologically Hooked**

我们在前面提到，百老汇歌舞剧的兴起带来了最早的一波名人文化（Celebrity Culture）. 那么我们为什么会受这样的文化吸引呢？比如吸引我们去追星、聊八卦的背后心理成因是什么？今天的彩蛋我们就来看一看心理学上的解释。



\1. We Like The World To Have A Narrative

我们的大脑需要在周围的世界里找到各种故事模式，乃至把某些作为我们的效仿典范（比如Gatsby这样的rags-to-riches的成功励志故事就会吸引很多人）。

而关注名人的生活和动向，恰好满足了这一需求。有研究发现，人们在公众场合的谈论中，有80%到90%都是关于八卦的。

Being aware of the goings-on in the lives of people more famous than us fills our brains' need to see patterns in the world, to make familiar storylines out of chaos. And it is a need. Some studies found that upwards of 80 to 90 percent of all conversations in public are gossip.



2.It Helps Us Move Up In Society

第二个原因其实和我们祖先的领导方式有关。在史前社会中，如果你想要合群并且占据领导高位，就要掌握部落里的各种大小动态（其实就是各种八卦消息 ）。要是一旦有情况发生，你就需要运用这些信息马上调度解决。

In prehistoric societies, knowing who was a jerk, who was sleeping with whom, and lots of other juicy details were all important things to stay on top of if you wanted to fit into your small tribe. As situations changed in your village, it was vital to know about them as soon as possible and be able to adjust to them if necessary. 

 

但即便进化到今天，我们的大脑也并没有完全高级到可以区分熟人八卦和明星八卦两者的重要性差别。简单来说 ，掌握办公室里的一些人事八卦或许可以帮助你升职，但知道明星的私生活细节对你其实是完全没有用的。

These days, our brains haven't advanced enough to the point where they can tell the difference in importance between gossip about people we know and celebrities.



\3. Schadenfreude Is Real

Schadenfreude是一个德文词，指“幸灾乐祸”（pleasure derived from the misfortunes of others）. 感到幸灾乐祸一般有三种情况：

 

①情况对你有利（It benefits you.）

②对方咎由自取（It seems like the person deserved it.）

③你很嫉妒对方（It happens to someone you envy.）

 

所以很多时候我们看到名人的丑闻也会产生这种心理——guilty pleasure. 比如2014年Justin Bieber因为非法赛车和醉驾被捕，当时推特上每分钟就有6100的消息量（24小时后达到了428万）。

 

Anecdotal evidence supports celebrity schadenfreude as our guilty pleasure as well. For example, in 2014, when Justin Bieber was arrested for drag racing while drunk and without a license, it generated a then-record 6,100 tweets per minute — 4.28 million in 24 hours.



\4. The Halo Effect Makes Us Think They Are Perfect

更多的时候 ，我们对名人们还会有崇拜的情结。因为我们的大脑会本能地认为，如果一个人在某一方面很出众，那么这个人在很大概率上各方面都是优秀的。

 

基于这种思维方式，名人的代言广告才有这么大的影响力。一个人的名气越大，越会产生更高的信赖值。

And this is why celebrity advertisements are so effective. We are more likely to trust them and their opinions than we are some random guy, since we know they are good at something else.
