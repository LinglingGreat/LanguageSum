**It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday night — and, as obscurely as it had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over.**

**Only gradually did I become aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away.**

> <font color=red>Only gradually / did I become aware / that the automobiles / which turned expectantly into his drive / stayed for just a minute / and then drove sulkily away.</font>

> ①turned expectantly into his drive “那些乘兴而来的一辆辆汽车”；expectantly指“满心期待地”（with an excited feeling that something is about to happen）; into his drive “开到Gatsby的私人车道上”，drive指“〔房屋与街道之间的〕私人车道”；
>
> ②sulkily “生闷气地，扫兴地”，比如：'You haven't got the right attitude,' he said sulkily.
>
> 他怄气道：“你态度不端正。”
>
> *这些人满怀欣喜地像以往一样准备来参加派对，在发现没有派对后又悻悻地走了。

**Wondering if he were sick I went over to find out — an unfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door.**

> ==villainous英 ['vɪlənəs] 美 [ˈvɪlənəs] adj. 罪恶的；恶棍的；恶毒的；坏透的==
>
> ==squint英 [skwɪnt] 美 [skwɪnt] vi. 眯眼看；斜视；窥视；偏移==

**“Is Mr. Gatsby sick?”**

**“Nope.” After a pause he added “sir”in a dilatory, grudging way.**

> ==dilatory adj. 拖拉的；缓慢的，不慌不忙的==
>
> ==grudging英 ['grʌdʒɪŋ] 美 [ˈɡrʌdʒɪŋ] adj. 勉强的；吝啬的==

**“I hadn’t seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell him Mr. Carraway came over.”**

**“Who?” he demanded rudely.**

**“Carraway.” “Carraway. All right, I’ll tell him.” Abruptly he slammed the door.**

**My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never went into West Egg Village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered moderate supplies over the telephone.**

**The grocery boy reported that the kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the village was that the new people weren’t servants at all.**

**Next day Gatsby called me on the phone.**

**“Going away?” I inquired.**

**“No, old sport.”**

**“I hear you fired all your servants.”**

**“I wanted somebody who wouldn’t gossip. Daisy comes over quite often — in the afternoons.”**

**So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval in her eyes.**

> <font color=red>So the whole caravansary / had fallen in / like a card house / at the disapproval in her eyes.</font>
>
> 如此说来，因为她不喜欢，这座大酒店就像纸牌搭的房子一样整个坍掉了。

> ①the whole caravansary “这座大酒店”，caravansary可以指过去的那种商队客栈，也可以指路边的酒店（相当于hotel）;
>
> *这里把Gatsby的房子比喻成前来寻欢作乐的人们的栖息之所。
>
> ②fall in 表示“倒塌”（to collapse）;
>
> *Daisy并不喜欢Gatsby所举办的这些浮华的派对，因为无论是派对的氛围还是前来参加的人，都触犯了Daisy身上的那种尊贵气息。这里也有讽刺的意味：仅仅因为Daisy的反对，一座如此豪华壮丽的房子就仿佛像纸牌屋一样坍塌了。

**“They’re some people Wolfsheim wanted to do something for. They’re all brothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel.”**

**“I see.” He was calling up at Daisy’s request — would I come to lunch at her house to-morrow? Miss Baker would be there.**

**Half an hour later Daisy herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was coming.**

**Something was up.**

**And yet I couldn’t believe that they would choose this occasion for a scene — especially for the rather harrowing scene that Gatsby had outlined in the garden.**

> <font color=red>And yet / I couldn’t believe / that they would choose this occasion for a scene / — especially for the rather harrowing scene / that Gatsby had outlined in the garden.</font>
>
> 然而我却不能相信他们竞然会选这样一个场合来大闹一场——尤其是盖茨比早先在花园里所提出的那种令人难堪的场面。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①choose this occasion for a scene “选这样一个场合来大闹一场”；scene在这里指“发脾气； 当众吵闹”，make a scene就是指embarrass people by publicly showing one's anger about something or doing something that is against the morals.
>
> ②the rather harrowing scene “那种令人难堪的场面”；harrowing指“折磨人的”（extremely upsetting or disturbing）.
>
> *Gatsby描绘的这个令人难堪的场面是指：He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and say: “I never loved you.” (Chapter 6.3)

**The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of the summer.**

**As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush at noon.**

> ==simmer英 ['sɪmə] 美 [ˈsɪmɚ] vi. 炖；内心充满；即将爆发==

> 原文：As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush at noon.
>
> 当我乘的火车从地道里钻出来驶进阳光里时，只有全国饼干公司热辣辣的汽笛打破了中午闷热的静寂。
>
> 💧simmering在这里指“酝酿已久的”。simmer原义是“炖，煨”，可以引申为“充满（难以控制的感情，尤指愤怒） ”，比如：She was stillsimmering with resentment.
>
> 她依旧憋着一肚子的怨恨。

**The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion; the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her fingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry.**

> 客车里的草椅垫热得简直要着火了。坐在我旁边的一个妇女起先很斯文地让汗水渗透衬衣，后来，她的报纸在她手指下面也变潮了时，她长叹一声，在酷热中颓然地往后一倒。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①hovered on the edge of combustion “热得简直要着火了”；hover表示“处于不稳定的状态”，hover on the edge of也就是“接近，快要”；比如：She hovered on the brink (=edge) of death for three months as doctors battled to save her. 
>
> 3个月来在医生们奋力挽救她的生命的过程中，她一直处在死亡的边缘。
>
> ②perspired delicately...into her white shirtwaist“很斯文地让汗水渗透衬衣”；perspire是比sweat更正式的表示“出汗”的说法；perspire delicately并不是真的“斯文地出汗”，而是诙谐地表示“微微出汗”（和后文“连报纸也变潮了”形成对比）；
>
> ③lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry “她长叹一声，在酷热中颓然地往后一倒”；lapse into表示“陷入”，比如：Alison lapsed into puzzled silence. 艾利森一头雾水，不作声了。desolate原义指“荒凉的”（deserted），还可以描述人“孤独凄凉的，忧伤的”（joyless, sorrowful）.

**Her pocket-book slapped to the floor.**

**“Oh, my!” she gasped.**

**I picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it at arm’s length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that I had no designs upon it — but everyone near by, including the woman, suspected me just the same.**

**“Hot!” said the conductor to familiar faces.**

**“Some weather! hot! hot! hot! Is it hot enough for you? Is it hot? Is it.. .?”**

**My commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand.**

> ==stain英 [steɪn] 美 [sten] vt. 玷污；败坏；给…着色==

**That any one should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed, whose head made damp the pajama pocket over his heart! . . .**

**Through the hall of the Buchanans’ house blew a faint wind, carrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at the door.**

**“The master’s body!” roared the butler into the mouthpiece.**

**“I’m sorry, madame, but we can’t furnish it — it’s far too hot to touch this noon!”**

**What he really said was: “Yes . . . yes . . . I’ll see.”**

**He set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to take our stiff straw hats.**

**“Madame expects you in the salon!” he cried, needlessly indicating the direction.**

**In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the common store of life.**

> <font color=red>In this heat / every extra gesture / was an affront to / the common store of life.</font>

**The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool.**

**Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols weighing down their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.**

**“We can’t move,” they said together.**

**Jordan’s fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment in mine.**

**“And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?” I inquired.**

**Simultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall telephone.**

**Gatsby stood in the centre of the crimson carpet and gazed around with fascinated eyes.**

> ==crimson英 ['krɪmz(ə)n] 美 [ˈkrɪmzən] n. 深红色==

**Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting laugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.**

**“The rumor is,” whispered Jordan, “that that’s Tom’s girl on the telephone.” We were silent.**

**The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance: “Very well, then, I won’t sell you the car at all. . . . I’m underno obligations to you at all . . . and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time, I won’t stand that at all!”**

**“Holding down the receiver,” said Daisy cynically.**

**“No, he’s not,” I assured her.**

**“It’s a bona-fide deal. I happen to know about it.”**

**Tom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his thick body, and hurried into the room.**

**“Mr. Gatsby!” He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed dislike.**

**“I’m glad to see you, sir. . . . Nick . . . .”**

**“Make us a cold drink,” cried Daisy.**

**As he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and pulled his face down, kissing him on the mouth.**

**“You know I love you,” she murmured.**

**“You forget there’s a lady present,” said Jordan.**

**Daisy looked around doubtfully.**

**“You kiss Nick too.”**

**“What a low, vulgar girl!”**

**“I don’t care!” cried Daisy, and began to clog on the brick fireplace.**

**Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.**

**“Bles-sed pre-cious,” she crooned, holding out her arms.**

**“Come to your own mother that loves you.”**

**The child, relinquished by the nurse,rushed across the room and rooted shyly into her mother’s dress.**

> <font color=red>relinquish英 [rɪ'lɪŋkwɪʃ] 美 [rɪˈlɪŋkwɪʃ] vt. 放弃；放手；让渡</font>

> 💧relinquish表示“放弃（尤指不情愿）”，也可以指“让出（权利，财产等）”，比如：He was forced to relinquish control of the company.
>
> 他被迫放弃对公司的控制权。

**“The bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy hair? Stand up now, and say — How-de-do.”**

**Gatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small, reluctant hand.**

**Afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise.**

**I don’t think he had ever really believed in its existence before.**

**“I got dressed before luncheon,” said the child, turning eagerly to Daisy.**

**“That’s because your mother wanted to show you off.”**

**Her face bent into the single wrinkle of the small, white neck.**

**“You dream, you. You absolute little dream.”**

**“Yes,” admitted the child calmly.**

**“Aunt Jordan’s got on a white dress too.”**

**“How do you like mother’s friends?”**

**Daisy turned her around so that she faced Gatsby.**

**“Do you think they’re pretty?”**

**“Where’s Daddy?”**

**“She doesn’t look like her father,” explained Daisy.**

**“She looks like me. She’s got my hair and shape of the face.”**

**Daisy sat back upon the couch.**

**The nurse took a step forward and held out her hand.**

**“Come, Pammy.”**

**“Good-by, sweetheart!”**

**With a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to her nurse’s hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back, preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.**

**Gatsby took up his drink.**

**“They certainly look cool,” he said, with visible tension.**

**We drank in long, greedy swallows.**

**“I read somewhere that the sun’s getting hotter every year,” said Tom genially.**

**“It seems that pretty soon the earth’s going to fall into the sun — or wait a minute — it’s just the opposite — the sun’s getting colder every year.**

**“Come outside,” he suggested to Gatsby, “I’d like you to have a look at the place.”**

### 背景知识

**💧Trimalchio 特里马尔乔**

...as obscurely as it had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over.（他作为特里马尔乔的生涯，当初莫名其妙地开始，现在又莫名其妙地结束了。）

Trimalchio（特里马尔乔）是罗马作家皮特罗尼斯作品《讽刺篇》中一个大宴宾客的暴户发（ a character in the 1st century AD Roman work of fiction Satyricon by Petronius）.  他原本是一个奴隶，被解放后通过自己的坚毅和努力得到权力和财富（freedman who through hard work and perseverance has attained power and wealth）. 他为人所知也是因为常常举办豪华的盛会宴请宾客（known for throwing lavish dinner parties）.

Trimalchio in West Egg也是Fitzegerald为这本书写的备选书名之一哦~



**💧Awning 天蓬**



The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. (这间屋子外面有这篷挡着，又阴暗又凉快。)

awning是指安置房子外墙上的用于遮阳或挡雨的天篷（a secondary covering attached to the exterior wall of a building）. 如下图↓

### 课文理解

在上次的聚会之后，人们（包括Nick）对Gatsby的好奇也渐渐越来越重了。但让大家意外的是，Gatsby的豪宅再也没有在周六的时候灯火通明过——也就是说，派对停止了。在Nick登门拜访Gatsby的时候，他才发现Gatsby还辞退了所有的仆人。而这一切举动，都是为了小心翼翼地保护他和Daisy的关系（"Daisy comes over quite often — in the afternoons."）——



💧**Clue 1**: Gatsby is discreet in protecting his affair with Daisy.



**Evidence 1**: My Finn informed me that Gatsbyad dismissed every servant in his house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never went into West Egg Village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered moderate supplies over the telephone.

我的芬兰女佣人告诉我，盖茨比早在一个星期前就辞退了家里的每一个仆人，另外雇用了五六个人，这些人从来不到西卵镇上去采购然后顺便收取店主的贿赂，而是打电话订购数量不多的生活用品。

“收取店主的贿赂”是指有些人可能想通过收买Gatsby的仆人来打听他的私人生活。足见Gatsby有多么小心谨慎了。



**Evidence 2**: They’re some people Wolfsheim wanted to do something for. They’re all brothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel.”

"他们是沃尔夫山姆要给帮点儿忙的人。他们都是兄弟姐妹。他们开过一家小旅馆。"



Nick观察到这些人似乎并不是真的仆人，比如给他开门的“仆人”是一副凶神恶煞的样子（"an unfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door"）. 根据Gatsby的透露，这些人是Wolfsheim找来的，目的是为了给他们安排一份工作。用这些人来当仆人的好处就是，他们从外地来，和West Egg的本地人自然没有接触，也就不用担心会走漏风声。

之后Nick和Gatsby一起受邀到Daisy家里做客。炎热的天气让故事氛围紧张躁动起来，与此同时，一场灾祸也正在酝酿。在这个过程中，作者也开始密集地安插预示最后悲剧的线索了。比如今天的内容中就有一个小细节揭示Gatsby的想象和现实之间的冲突——



💧**Clue 2**: Gatsby's perception is in collision with reality.



**Evidence 1**: Afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise. I don’t think he had ever really believed in its existence before.

然后他惊奇地盯着孩子看。我想他以前从来没有真正相信过有这个孩子存在。

Gatsby一直在自己的世界里重塑Daisy的形象，乃至于忘记了现实中的Daisy已经结婚并且已经有了一个可爱的女儿（从前面Daisy和女儿的互动来看她非常喜欢这个孩子）。这里Gatsby并没有作出过于激烈的反应，也许是他在努力按捺，也可能是他继续选择忽视。但随着现实逐渐迫近，他必然要面对最残酷的情况，到时候又会发生什么呢？

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****各种场合下的scene**

今天的原文里出现了用scene表示“当众吵闹”这个用法（And yet I couldn’t believe that they would choose this occasion for a scene）, 我们再来看一看scene在其他场合下还能表达什么意思~



\1. Behind the scenes 幕后

这个很好理解，scenes在这里就是指“（电视/电影）屏幕”，behind the scenes也就是指“幕后”啦~ 一般在致辞感谢的时候都会提到幕后工作人员，比如：

Let's have a round of applause for all the people who worked behind the scenes to give us such a great event!

behind the scenes也可指“实景拍摄场地，摄影棚”。



\2. Not one's scene 不感兴趣/不擅长

这里的scene指“圈子，领域”，比如on the music scene就是“在音乐领域”。所以not one's scene就是“不是某人的领域（不感兴趣或不擅长）”。比如：

-"Do you want to come with me to the concert this Saturday?"

-"No thanks, heavy metal isn't my scene."

 

\3. Arrive on the scene 到达现场/诞生

scene可以指“某个事件发生的现场”，而且一般是不好的事件，arrive on the scene就表示“到达现场”，比如：

By the time I arrived on the scene, Kate and Jen were already arguing.



此外，arrive on the scene还可以表示“诞生，问世”，比如：

①We are overjoyed to announced that our baby daughter arrived on the scene at 11:37 last night.

②Funk music arrived on the scene in the 1960s.

 

\4. Heavy scene 沉重的场面

heavy scene指“情况严重或困难的场面”，比如：

Man, that meeting was really a heavy scene.

电影里面的一些可怕场景也可以说成是heavy scene.



\5. Have a change of scene 换（生活/工作）环境

当你想要搬到另一个城市来换一个生活环境的时候，就可以这么说：

I decided to move across the country for college because I really wanted a change of scene after growing up in this small town.

**I went with them out to the veranda.**

**On the green Sound, stagnant in the heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea.**

> 在绿色的海湾上，海水在酷热中停滞不动，一条小帆船慢慢向比较新鲜的海水移动。

>
> 他正在就如何振兴低迷的经济征求意见。

**Gatsby’s eyes followed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed across the bay.**

**“I’m right across from you.” “So you are.”**

**Our eyes lifted over the rose-beds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse of the dog-days along-shore.**

**Slowly the white wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit of the sky.**

**Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and the abounding blessed isles.**

> ==isle英 [aɪl] 美 [aɪl] n. 岛==

> 再往前是水波荡漾的海洋和星罗棋布的宝岛。

**“There’s sport for you,” said Tom, nodding.**

**“I’d like to be out there with him for about an hour.”**

**We had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened too against the heat, and drank down nervous gayety with the cold ale.**

>
> 我们在餐厅里吃的午饭，里面也遮得很阴凉，大家把紧张的欢笑和凉啤酒一起喝下肚去。

> ①darkened too against the heat “遮得很阴凉”；这里指餐厅的窗户外也安置了遮阳的天篷（我们昨天介绍的awning）;
>
> ②drank down nervous gayety with the cold ale“大家把紧张的欢笑和凉啤酒一起喝下肚去”；drink down指“一饮而尽”（to drink all of something）; nervous gayety也是一组矛盾修辞（Oxymoron）, 这里暗示虽然表面上气氛融洽，但其实大家都各自心怀鬼胎。

**“What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon?” cried Daisy, “and the day after that, and the next thirty years?”**

**“Don’t be morbid,” Jordan said.**

**“Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.”**

> ==morbid==

> adj.（兴趣、精神、思想等）病态的
>
> 原文：“Don’t be morbid,” Jordan said. “Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.”
>
> "不要这样胡思乱想，"乔丹说，"秋天一到，天高气爽，生活就又重新开始了。

> 💧morbid表示“病态的”，尤指“心理上不正常的”，比如：Some people have a morbid fascination with crime.
>
> 一些人对犯罪有一种病态的痴迷。
>
> 💧morbid的名词形式是morbidity. morbidity and mortality就是指“（某一疾病的）发病率和死亡率” 。

**“But it’s so hot,” insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, “and everything’s so confused. Let’s all go to town!”**

**Her voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, molding its senselessness into forms.**

> <font color=red>Her voice struggled on / through the heat, / beating against it, / molding its senselessness into forms.</font>
>
> 她的声音继续在热浪中挣扎，向它冲击着，把没有知觉的热气塑成各种形状。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①struggled on through the heat “继续在热浪中挣扎”；struggle on 表示“继续挣扎”（keep on struggling）, on在这里作副词，表示一种持续性；
>
> ②molding its senselessness into forms “把没有知觉的热气塑成各种形状”；senselessness是指热气（the heat）本身的特质，有两层含义：“没有知觉、意识”（unconsciousness）; “没有意义、目的”（meaningness）;
>
> *这里作者表达得很晦涩，但其实就是在暗指Daisy说的话、她的声音也充斥着“无意义”，比如：“What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon?” cried Daisy, “and the day after that, and the next thirty years?”

**“I’ve heard of making a garage out of a stable,” Tom was saying to Gatsby, “but I’m the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage.”**

**“Who wants to go to town?” demanded Daisy insistently.**

**Gatsby’s eyes floated toward her.**

**“Ah,” she cried, “you look so cool.”**

**Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space.**

**With an effort she glanced down at the table.**

**“You always look so cool,” she repeated.**

**She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw.**

**He was astounded.**

**His mouth opened a little, and he looked at Gatsby, and then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as some one he knew a long time ago.**

**“You resemble the advertisement of the man,” she went on innocently.**

**“You know the advertisement of the man ——”**

**“All right,” broke in Tom quickly, “I’m perfectly willing to go to town. Come on — we’re all going to town.”**

**He got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife. No one moved.**

**“Come on!” His temper cracked a little.**

**“What’s the matter, anyhow? If we’re going to town, let’s start.”**

**His hand, trembling with his effort at self-control, bore to his lips the last of his glass of ale.**

**Daisy’s voice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing gravel drive.**

**“Are we just going to go?” she objected.**

**“Like this? Aren’t we going to let any one smoke a cigarette first?”**

**“Everybody smoked all through lunch.”**

**“Oh, let’s have fun,” she begged him.**

**“It’s too hot to fuss.”**

**He didn’t answer.**

**“Have it your own way,” she said.**

**“Come on, Jordan.”**

**They went up-stairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet.**

> ==shuffle英 ['ʃʌf(ə)l] 美 [ˈʃʌfəl] v. 洗牌；推诿，推卸；拖曳，慢吞吞地走；搅乱==

**A silver curve of the moon hovered already in the western sky.**

**Gatsby started to speak, changed his mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.**

**“Have you got your stables here?” asked Gatsby with an effort.**

**“About a quarter of a mile down the road.” “Oh.” A pause.**

**“I don’t see the idea of going to town,” broke out Tom savagely.**

> ==savagely英 ['sævɪdʒlɪ] 美 [ˈsævɪdʒlɪ] adv. 野蛮地；残忍地==

**“Women get these notions in their heads ——”**

**“Shall we take anything to drink?” called Daisy from an upper window.**

**“I’ll get some whiskey,” answered Tom. He went inside.**

**Gatsby turned to me rigidly: “I can’t say anything in his house, old sport.”**

**“She’s got an indiscreet voice,” I remarked. “It’s full of ——” I hesitated.**

**“Her voice is full of money,” he said suddenly.**

**That was it. I’d never understood before.**

**It was full of money — that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals’song of it. . . . high in a white palace the king’s daughter, the golden girl. . . .**

**Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and carrying light capes over their arms.**

**“Shall we all go in my car?” suggested Gatsby.**

**He felt the hot, green leather of the seat.**

**“I ought to have left it in the shade.”**

**“Is it standard shift?” demanded Tom.**

**“Yes.” “Well, you take my coupe and let me drive your car to town.”**

**The suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby.**

**“I don’t think there’s much gas,” he objected.**

**“Plenty of gas,” said Tom boisterously.**

**He looked at the gauge. “And if it runs out I can stop at a drug-store. You can buy anything at a drug-store nowadays.”**

**A pause followed this apparently pointless remark.**

**Daisy looked at Tom frowning, and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar and vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in words, passed over Gatsby’s face.**

**“Come on, Daisy,” said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby’s car.**

**“I’ll take you in this circus wagon.”**

**He opened the door, but she moved out from the circle of his arm.**

**“You take Nick and Jordan. We’ll follow you in the coupe.”**

**“I’ve made a small investigation of this fellow,” he continued.**

**“I could have gone deeper if I’d known ——”**

**“Do you mean you’ve been to a medium?” inquired Jordan humorously.**

**“What?” Confused, he stared at us as we laughed. “A medium?”**

**“About Gatsby.”**

**“About Gatsby! No, I haven’t. I said I’d been making a small investigation of his past.”**

**“And you found he was an Oxford man,” said Jordan helpfully.**

**“An Oxford man!” He was incredulous.**

**“Like hell he is! He wears a pink suit.”**

**“Nevertheless he’s an Oxford man.”**

**“Oxford, New Mexico,” snorted Tom contemptuously, “or something like that.”**

**“Listen, Tom. If you’re such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?” demanded Jordan crossly.**

**“Daisy invited him; she knew him before we were married — God knows where!”**

**We were all irritable now with the fading ale, and aware of it we drove for a while in silence.**

**Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg’s faded eyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby’s caution about gasoline.**

**“We’ve got enough to get us to town,” said Tom.**

**“But there’s a garage right here,” objected Jordan.**

**“I don’t want to get stalled in this baking heat.”**

**Tom threw on both brakes impatiently, and we slid to an abruptdusty stop under Wilson’s sign.**

**“Been sick all day.”**

**“What’s the matter?” “I’m all run down.”**

**In the sunlight his face was green.**

**“I didn’t mean to interrupt your lunch,” he said.**

**“How do you like this one?” inquired Tom. “I bought it last week.”**

**“It’s a nice yellow one,” said Wilson,as he strained at the handle.**

**“Like to buy it?”**

**“Big chance,” Wilson smiled faintly.**

**“No, but I could make some money on the other.”**

**“What do you want money for, all of a sudden?”**

**“I’ve been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and I want to go West.”**

**“Your wife does,” exclaimed Tom, startled.**

**“She’s been talking about it for ten years.”**

**He rested for a moment against the pump, shading his eyes.**

**“And now she’s going whether she wants to or not. I’m going to get her away.”**

### 背景知识

**💧Connotation of the color pink** 

**粉色暗示了什么？**

“An Oxford man!” He was incredulous. “Like hell he is! He wears a pink suit.”（"牛津大学毕业生！"他完全不相信，"他要是才他妈的怪哩！他穿一套粉红色衣服。"）

为什么Tom仅仅因为Gatsby穿了一套粉红色的衣服就笃定说他不是牛津大学毕业的呢？虽然今天我们对于粉色的偏见往往在于它的性别气质，比如认为粉色代表的是女性气质femininity, 对于穿粉色衣服的男孩会“戏称”为sissy（女孩子气的男孩）。但在20世纪初的美国，粉色常常和一个人的出身阶级（class origin）联系在一起：

 

Pink had working-class connotations.

也就是说，工人阶层才会穿粉色，一个受过高等教育、上层社会的绅士是不会穿粉色的（An educated, upper-class gentleman – an Oxford man – would not wear a pink suit）.

 

但在今天，这个潮流也出现了反转。比如喜欢穿粉色T恤或者在高尔夫球场上穿粉色裤子的，常常是混迹各个乡间俱乐部（country club）的年轻富家子弟们（It’s the preppie type men at the country club who are wearing pink shirts or even, on the golf course, pants）.



**💧Snob 势利鬼**



“Listen, Tom. If you’re such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?” demanded Jordan crossly.

"我说，汤姆，你既然这样”瞧不起人，那么为什么请他吃午饭呢？"乔丹气恼地质问道。

snob指“自命不凡的人，势利鬼”（a person who despises, ignores, or is patronizing to those he or she considers inferior）. 我们熟悉的虚构人物形象属于snob这一类呢？

 

比如，《怪物史莱克》里的白马王子（Prince Charming）:

"I am the rightful King of Far Far Away!"（我才是遥远王国的真正国王！）

"I mean, how charming can I be when I have to pretend that I'm that dreadful orge?"（要我装成那个可怕的怪物，我还怎么展示我的魅力呢！）——Prince Charming把自己变成Shrek接近Fiona, 但说话和行为都完全是自己原本暴躁傲慢的样子，结果当然没能赢得Fiona的爱和信任，于是有了以上的托辞。

### 课文理解

开头的场景依然是在Tom的豪宅里。尽管表面上其乐融融，但暗地里却隐藏着不少紧张激烈的情节，比如Daisy在Tom的面前公然和Gatsby调情——



💧**Clue 1**: Dasiy is being obvious about her affair with 



**Evidence 1**: “You always look so cool,” she repeated. She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw.

"你看上去总是那么帅。"她重复说。她已经告诉他她爱他，汤姆·布坎农也看出来了。

 

比起Gatsby的小心谨慎，Daisy则轻佻得多。比如毫不掩饰自己从以前就认识Gatsby这件事（Daisy用了always）, 以及她对他的爱慕 。

之后大家一起准备出发去纽约市里的时候，Daisy拒绝和Tom同车，而是大摇大摆地走向了Gatsby, 还用手拽着他的上衣（俨然一副小鸟依人的模样）——



**Evidence 2**: He opened the door, but she moved out from the circle of his arm. “You take Nick and Jordan. We’ll follow you in the coupe.” She walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand.

他打开车门，但她从他手臂的圈子里走了出去。"你带尼克和乔丹去。我们开小轿车跟在你后面。" 她走近盖茨比，用手摸着他的上衣。

这可以说是Daisy对Tom出轨在先的挑衅和反击了，但她是否真的有意要和Gatsby再续前缘也还没能下定论。我们再来看一看今天内容里出现的Daisy声音的描述——



💧**Clue 2**: Daisy's voice is materialistic and shallow.



**Evidence 1**: It was full of money — that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals’ song of it. . . . high in a white palace the king’s daughter, the golden girl. . . .

它是充满了金钱——这正是她声音里抑扬起伏的无穷无尽的魅力的源泉，金钱了当的声音，铙钹齐鸣的歌声……高高的在一座白色的宫殿里，国王的女儿，黄金女郎……

 

在前面的几章内容中，Daisy的声音给我们留下的印象是“迷人的”（enchanting）“神秘的”（mysterious）, 总是让人不由自主地朝她靠近。而这里的描述则更直接——“她的声音充满了金钱”，有两层含义：一是指她出身富有；二是指她对物质金钱有着强烈的渴望。

除了物质性，她的声音还透露了她的肤浅——



**Evidence 2**: “What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon?” cried Daisy, “and the day after that, and the next thirty years?”

"我们今天下午做什么好呢？"黛西大声说，"还有明天，还有今后三十年？"

 

读到这里，大家也许想起了Nick第一次到他们家做客的时候，Daisy也有过一番类似的发问：“Do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it.” “All right,” said Daisy. “What’ll we plan?” She turned to me helplessly: “What do people plan?”

这两处的问句都属于“假装疑问”（Aporia）的修辞手法，也就是说话者虽然在提问，但其实并不期待可以得到回答，因为问题本身往往是无解的，比如《哈姆雷特》中的"To be, or not to be: that is the question."就是一个典型的例子。

这些问题反映出了Daisy内心的空洞，另一方面也折射了她所处的上流阶层的生活，在浮华背后其实是空虚和挥霍。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****Some knowledge about beer 啤酒常识**

因为天气炎热，所以故事里的主人公们都喝起了冰啤酒来解暑（We had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened too against the heat, and drank down nervous gayety with the cold ale）.

那么这里的ale指的是什么啤酒呢？我们来看一看啤酒的分类~

 

\1. 啤酒分类

啤酒进化的过程有几千年的时间，弄不清它的风格口味是很正常的。一般可以按照颜色和产地来分，但也可以根据啤酒本身的发酵方式（国外习惯直接在啤酒瓶上标注啤酒的风味，所以了解发酵方式会更在选择种类的时候更便利哦~），最基本的是两种：Ale（爱尔）和Lager（拉格）。两者的差别只在于发酵的温度和酵母工作的位置（Ale是上发酵，Lager是下发酵）↓

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/34fdf803968f30ef087214293ee8e67f-sz_15257.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



直观来说，就是喝Ale啤酒的时候先喝到酵母和辅料的味道，之后要在这些味道里面找麦芽的香味，而Lager啤酒先喝到的是麦芽的香味，然后才有其它辅料的味道。 

 

其他各种风味都是从两种发酵方式演变而来的，比如黑啤（Stout）就属于Ale的一种。黑啤的出现是因为1698年彼得大帝在它的欧洲之旅时爱上了 英国波特黑啤酒，并要求英国酒商为俄罗斯圣彼得堡的宫廷酿造波特啤酒。但是，由于途经两百多公里寒冷的波罗的海，啤酒面临冻结、变坏等问题，变得不可饮用。英国酒商随之进行改良，增强了该酒的酒精浓度和啤酒花投放量（所以酒精度数比较高并且苦味很重），以抵御严寒的天气并更好保存啤酒。

 

最有名的一款黑啤是由英国约克郡森美尔（Samuel Smith）啤酒厂生产的帝国世涛（Imperial Stout）.

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/4196937d53cb6b679945067f19004c54-sz_39710.jpeg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



在《王牌特工》里出现的健力士（Guinness）也是黑啤。

而国内产的青岛、燕京都属于Lager（所以品牌商会非常强调“麦芽”，因为Lager先喝到的是麦芽香）。

 

\2. 啤酒选择

一般在选择啤酒的时候很容易产生以下误解：

①啤酒的颜色越深酒精度越高？

深色的啤酒往往给人带来酒精度更高、口味更重的感觉。在绝大数情况下啤酒的颜色取决于麦芽，而决定酒精度高低的是麦汁中的含糖量，而不是麦芽的颜色。同时也跟酿制工艺有关。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/0c9fe01e0fcab1c3aee0fc1874661c77-sz_21110.jpeg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



②啤酒泡沫越多越好？

啤酒质量好坏不能以泡沫的多少来定。优质啤酒的泡沫应细腻、洁白，且挂杯持久，酒液饮完之后仍有大量泡沫在杯壁之上，才是真正的好啤酒。同时泡沫的多少还取决于啤酒的风格和当时的饮用温度。

 

③啤酒还有生的？熟的？

熟啤（Pasteurimd）指的是经过了巴氏消毒灭菌的啤酒。但高温杀菌使其牺牲了一定的口感，并不是最好喝的啤酒。真正好喝的是生啤，也叫鲜啤（Draught）, 它保留了啤酒原有的风味和活性酵母菌，口感更胜一筹。但这种啤酒保质期不长只有3—5天，而且必须低温保存。

并且在生啤里最好喝的是——“扎啤”（Draft）. draft是指“经过净化、汲取的”，这样命名是因为扎啤从酿造工艺来讲，本质就是酿制成熟的，未经热处理的。因此也保持了良好的口味和营养。

对于喜欢清淡口味的小伙伴来说，light beer也会是不错的选择哦~

**The coupe flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a waving hand.**

**“What do I owe you?” demanded Tom harshly.**

**“I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,” remarked Wilson.**

**“That’s why I want to get away. That’s why I been bothering you about the car.”**

**“What do I owe you?”**

**“Dollar twenty.”**

> *上文Mr. Wilson提到自己得知了一个真相（也就是他的妻子Myrtle有了外遇），所以才急着找Tom把那辆二手车卖给他，接着就带自己的妻子离开：“I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,” remarked Wilson. “That’s why I want to get away. That’s why I been bothering you about the car.”（wise up “知道，了解糟糕的真相”；funny “不老实的，错误的”）；但他并没有意识到Myrtle出轨的对象是Tom.

**He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world, and the shock had made him physically sick.**

**I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour before — and it occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well.**

**Wilson was so sick that he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty — as if he had just got some poor girl with child.**

> <font color=red>I stared at him / and then at Tom, / who had made a parallel discovery / less than an hour before / — and it occurred to me / that there was no difference between men, / in intelligence or race, / so profound / as the difference / between the sick and the well.</font>

>
> *其次也是在讽刺Tom, 他虽然在学识教养和血统地位上都胜过Mr. Wilson, 但在遇到妻子出轨这样的事情上，他和Mr. Wilson的那种失神慌张的反应都是一样的（There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. ），仅凭这一点就足以抹杀他在其他方面的所有优越感。

**“I’ll let you have that car,” said Tom.**

**“I’ll send it over to-morrow afternoon.”**

**That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of something behind.**

**Over the ash heaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil, but I perceived, after a moment, that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away.**

**In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a little, and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car.**

**So engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed, and one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture.**

> <font color=red>So engrossed was she / that she had no consciousness / of being observed, / and one emotion after another / crept into her face / like objects into a slowly developing picture.</font>

**Her expression was curiously familiar —**

**it was an expression I had often seen on women’s faces, but on Myrtle Wilson’s face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on Jordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife.**

**There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic.**

**“You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it.”**

**He unrolled the bottle of whiskey from the towel and put it on the table.**

**“Why not let her alone, old sport?” remarked Gatsby.**

**“You’re the one that wanted to come to town.”**

**There was a moment of silence.**

**The telephone book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered, “Excuse me.”— but this time no one laughed.**

**“I’ll pick it up,” I offered.**

**“I’ve got it.” Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered “Hum!” in an interested way, and tossed the book on a chair.**

**“That’s a great expression of yours, isn’t it?” said Tom sharply.**

**“What is?” “All this ‘old sport’ business. Where’d you pick that up?”**

**“Now see here, Tom,” said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, “if you’re going to make personal remarks I won’t stay here a minute. Call up and order some ice for the mint julep.”**

**As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn’s Wedding March from the ballroom below.**

**“Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!” cried Jordan dismally.**

> ==dismally英 ['dɪzməlɪ] 美 ['dɪzməlɪ] adv. 沉闷地；阴暗地==

**“Still — I was married in the middle of June,” Daisy remembered, “Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?”**

**“Biloxi,” he answered shortly.**

**“A man named Biloxi. ‘blocks’ Biloxi,and he made boxes — that’s a fact — and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.”**

**And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy told him he had to get out.**

**The day after he left Daddy died.”**

**After a moment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent, “There wasn’t any connection.”**

**“I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,” I remarked.**

**“That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he left. He gave me an aluminum putter that I use to-day.”**

**The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of “Yea-ea-ea!” and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began.**

**“We’re getting old,” said Daisy.**

**“If we were young we’d rise and dance.”**

**“Remember Biloxi,” Jordan warned her.**

**“Where’d you know him, Tom?”**

**“Biloxi?” He concentrated with an effort.**

**“I didn’t know him. He was a friend of Daisy’s.”**

**“He was not,” she denied.**

**“I’d never seen him before. He came down in the private car.”**

**“Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville. Asa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room for him.”**

**Jordan smiled.**

**“He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of your class at Yale.”**

**Tom and I looked at each other blankly. “Biloxi?”**

**“First place, we didn’t have any president ——”**

**Gatsby’s foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.**

**“By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you’re an Oxford man.”**

**“Not exactly.”**

**“Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.”**

**“Yes — I went there.” A pause.**

**Then Tom’s voice, incredulous and insulting: “You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven.” Another pause.**

**A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but, the silence was unbroken by his “thank you” and the soft closing of the door.**

**This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.**

**“I told you I went there,” said Gatsby.**

**“I heard you, but I’d like to know when.”**

**“It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That’s why I can’t really call myself an Oxford man.”**

**Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief.**

**But we were all looking at Gatsby.**

**“It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the Armistice,” he continued.**

**“We could go to any of the universities in England or France.”**

**I wanted to get up and slap him on the back.**

**I had one of those renewals of complete faith in him that I’d experienced before.**

### 背景知识

**💧Armistice of 11 November 1918 一战停战协定**

“It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the Armistice,” he continued. “We could go to any of the universities in England or France.”（"那是停战以后他们为一些军官提供的机会，"他继续说下去，"我们可以上任何英国或者法国的大学。"）

整整100年前——1918年11月11日上午11时，在法国贡比涅（Compiègne）的一节火车车厢内，协约国（Allied Powers）与德国签署停火协定，协定标志着历时四年的第一次世界大战的结束。

这是一场导致4000万多人伤亡的人类历史上最残酷的战争之一。停战协定公布后，人们涌上街头欢呼。

美国虽然在战争最初两年正式保持中立，但为协约国提供了重要的援助、资金和物资。美国于1917年正式加入协约国参战。

这里Gatsby的叙述如果属实，我们还可以根据这个时间点，推断出一些隐藏的剧情:

1918年11月一战结束，Gatsby被送往Oxford University呆了5个月；

1919年6月Tom和Daisy结婚 （“Still — I was married in the middle of June,” Daisy remembered.）

*具体的年份推算大家可以自己在书本内容里找一找线索哦~

所以Daisy在婚礼前夕收到Gatsby的来信内容应该是Gatsby很快就会回国了，所以才令Daisy痛苦无比。

### 课文理解

今天的内容里，紧张继续升级。作者在情节安排也设置了不少巧合和隐喻，比如Mr. Wilson也发现了自己太太的不忠，同样的情形在不到一小时之前就发生在了Tom的身上（I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour before）. 但对于Tom来说，则变成了两个致命打击，他已经处于极大的不安和混乱中——



💧**Clue 1**: Tom is in great disquite and disturbance.



**Evidence 1**: There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic.

一个简单的头脑陷入慌乱时是非同小可的，等到我们车子开走的时候，汤姆感到惊慌失措，心里就像正遭受恐惧鞭打一样。



这里a simple mind不仅指Tom的“思想单纯”（比如缺乏谨慎和周全），还暗示了他“只一门心思地想要获得对周围人事物的掌控权”，可以说是一种近乎不理智的偏执。所以他发现自己的情妇和妻子都在脱离自己控制的时候，便感觉惊慌无比。



**Evidence 2**: Several times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight. I think he was afraid they would dart down a side street and out of his life forever.

有好几次他掉过头去向后看，找他们的车子，如果路上的交通把他们耽误了，他就放慢速度，直到他们重新出现。我想他生怕他们会钻进一条小街，从此永远从他生活里消失。



Mr. Wilson决心带Myrtle离开，而且可能已经把她禁足了（在Tom和Nick以及Jordan逗留修车行的时候，Myrtle只是透过窗户看着他们：In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a little, and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car.）所以Tom已经失去了一个筹码，如果再失去Daisy, 他将承受无法想象的流言蜚语带来的羞辱感。



作者还安插了两个隐喻，同时也是两个凶兆（sinister omens）,  指向接下来即将发生的冲突和悲剧——



💧**Clue 2**: The sinister omens — eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg and words by Jordan.



**Evidence 1**: ...and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of something behind. Over the ashheaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil...

因此现在我掉过头去，仿佛有人要我提防背后有什么东西。在灰堆上方，T·J·埃克尔堡大夫的巨眼在守望着……



Eckleburg大夫之眼可以看作上帝之眼的象征——监视、审判一切。kept their vigil就是指“守夜”（尤指为了祈祷、守护病人或是提防危险情况）。这里隐晦地暗示了有不详的事情要发生。



**Evidence 2**: “I love New York on summer afternoons when every one’s away. There’s something very sensuous about it — overripe, as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands.”

"我爱夏天午后的纽约，人都跑光了。它是那么的令人快活——一种熟透的滋味，仿佛各种奇异的果实都纷纷落到你手里。"



sensuous本义指“性感的，肉感的”，强调给人以“感官上的愉悦”（pleasing to people's senses）. 这里强调了纽约的娱乐活动都是物质或肉欲上的，暗示了道德上的败落。而overripe指“过熟的，熟到快要烂的”，同样也暗示了故事发展已经进入高潮，所有的矛盾冲突都到了爆发的时间点。



另外，“果实落入手中”（frujts falling into hands）这个意象也和圣经中亚当夏娃偷食禁果的故事有一定联系。这一行为在宗教上的象征意义是“人类的堕落”（fall from grace）, 直译是“从上帝的恩典中堕落”，以及“失去纯真”（loss of innocence）. 这里暗指接下来故事中的人物们将会作出一些违背道德甚至人性的事情。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧关于《婚礼进行曲》你不知道的事**



As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn’s Wedding March from the ballroom below.（汤姆一拿起话筒，那憋得紧紧的热气突然爆发出声音，这时我们听到门德尔松的《婚礼进行曲》惊心动魄的和弦从底下舞厅里传上来。）



屋子里火药味正浓的时候，楼底下传来了门德尔松的《婚礼进行曲》，本来欢快激情的音乐变成了让人感觉不详的预兆（portentous指“预示凶兆的”）。《婚礼进行曲》尽管已经成为了一个老掉牙的传统，但其实背后深有讲究，今天的彩蛋我们就来看一看它里面的典故和秘密~



\1. 婚礼进行曲有两首

首先，婚礼进行曲有两首，并且演奏的场合及目的都不同：

一首是上文提到的由门德尔松（Mendelssohn）创作的，氛围偏向于欢快欣喜，一般在新人牵手走出礼堂时演奏；特点是以响亮的小号声开始，随后进入到一段庄严的列队进行音乐，接下来是较轻松活泼的进行曲，重复两次后与木管乐器的优雅声混为一片，逐渐淡去。

另一首则是由瓦格纳（Wagner）创作的，速度徐缓，氛围偏向于庄严肃穆，是新娘入场时要演奏的（for the entry of the bride）. 而且有一个明显的特点就是开始和和结尾都有几声钟响，似乎在宣告婚姻的来临。



\2. 婚礼进行曲的由来

瓦格纳所作的《婚礼进行曲》，原是三幕传奇歌剧《罗恩格林》里在贵妇们引导新人入新房的混声合唱，后被改编成管弦乐而成为了今天的曲子。

这首进行曲比较庄重肃穆也跟故事情节有关：人神相爱，但作为人类的新娘必须要严格遵守不询问新郎姓名和来历的誓言，俩人才能结婚；但是后来有坏人从中作梗，引诱新娘破坏了誓言，最后俩人没能顺利结婚并且从此无法见面。



而门德尔松所作的《婚礼进行曲》，是为莎士比亚著名的喜剧作品《仲夏夜之梦》第五幕所作的前奏曲配乐。

这个故事本身充满了浪漫和梦幻：互相爱慕的男女主人公被女主的父亲反对，女主的父亲给她安排的未婚夫却是女主好友的爱慕对象。后来四个人一起逃入森林，又因为仙王乱施魔汁而导致四人之间情感错乱。但最终仙子还是把错误修正并且促成了两对恋人。

也正是有了甜蜜逗乐的故事，门德尔松的进行曲才更美妙活泼得多~

**Daisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.**

**“Open the whiskey, Tom,” she ordered, “and I’ll make you a mint julep. Then you won’t seem so stupid to yourself. . . . Look at the mint!”**

**“Wait a minute,” snapped Tom, “I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question.”**

**“Go on,” Gatsby said politely.**

**“What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?”**

**They were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.**

**“He isn’t causing a row.”**

**Daisy looked desperately from one to the other.**

**“You’re causing a row. Please have a little self-control.”**

**“Self-control!” Repeated Tom incredulously.**

**“I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife.**

**Well, if that’s the idea you can count me out. . . .**

**Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next they’ll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white.”**

**“We’re all white here,” murmured Jordan.**

**“I know I’m not very popular. I don’t give big parties.**

**I suppose you’ve got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any friends — in the modern world.”**

**Angry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he opened his mouth.**

**The transition from libertine to prig was so complete.**

**“I’ve got something to tell you, old sport ——” began Gatsby.**

**But Daisy guessed at his intention.**

**“Please don’t!” she interrupted helplessly.**

**“Please let’s all go home. Why don’t we all go home?”**

**“That’s a good idea.” I got up.**

**“Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink.”**

**“I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.”**

**“Your wife doesn’t love you,” said Gatsby. “She’s never loved you. She loves me.”**

**“You must be crazy!” exclaimed Tom automatically.**

**Gatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.**

**“She never loved you, do you hear?” he cried.**

**“She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved any one except me!”**

**At this point Jordan and I tried to go, but Tom and Gatsby insisted with competitive firmness that we remain — as though neither of them had anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emotions.**

**“Sit down, Daisy,” Tom’s voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal note.**

**“What’s been going on? I want to hear all about it.”**

**“I told you what’s been going on,” said Gatsby.**

**“Going on for five years — and you didn’t know.”**

**Tom turned to Daisy sharply.**

**“You’ve been seeing this fellow for five years?”**

**“Not seeing,” said Gatsby.**

**“No, we couldn’t meet. But both of us loved each other all that time, old sport, and you didn’t know. I used to laugh sometimes.”— but there was no laughter in his eyes ——” to think that you didn’t know.”**

**“Oh — that’s all.”**

**Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman and leaned back in his chair.**

> ==clergyman英 ['klɜːdʒɪmən] 美 [ˈklɜ:rdʒimən] n. 牧师；教士==

**“You’re crazy!” he exploded.**

**“I can’t speak about what happened five years ago, because I didn’t know Daisy then — and I’ll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door.**

**But all the rest of that’s a God damned lie.**

**Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now.”**

**“No,” said Gatsby, shaking his head.**

**“She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas in her head and doesn’t know what she’s doing.”**

**He nodded sagely.**

**“And what’s more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time.”**

**“You’re revolting,” said Daisy.**

> ==revolting adj. 极难闻的,使人厌恶的,令人恶心的==

**She turned to me, and her voice, dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: “Do you know why we left Chicago?**

**I’m surprised that they didn’t treat you to the story of that little spree.”**

**Gatsby walked over and stood beside her.**

**“Daisy, that’s all over now,” he said earnestly.**

**“It doesn’t matter any more. Just tell him the truth — that you never loved him — and it’s all wiped out forever.”**

**She looked at him blindly.**

**“Why — how could I love him — possibly?”**

**“You never loved him.” She hesitated.**

**Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal, as though she realized at last what she was doing — and as though she had never, all along, intended doing anything at all.**

**But it was done now. It was too late.**

**“I never loved him,” she said, with perceptible reluctance.**

**“Not at Kapiolani?” demanded Tom suddenly.**

**“No.”**

**There was a husky tenderness in his tone.. .. “Daisy?”**

**“Please don’t.” Her voice was cold, but the rancor was gone from it.**

> ==rancor英 ['ræŋkə] 美 [ˈræŋkɚ] n. 深仇；怨恨；敌意==

**She looked at Gatsby.**

**“There, Jay,” she said — but her hand as she tried to light a cigarettewas trembling.**

**Suddenly she threw the cigarette and the burning match on the carpet.**

**“Oh, you want too much!” she cried to Gatsby.**

**“I love you now — isn’t that enough? I can’t help what’s past.”**

**She began to sob helplessly.**

**“I did love him once — but I loved you too.”**

**Gatsby’s eyes opened and closed.**

**“You loved me too?” he repeated.**

**“Even that’s a lie,” said Tom savagely.**

**“She didn’t know you were alive. Why — there’re things between Daisy and me that you’ll never know, things that neither of us can ever forget.”**

**The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.**

**“I want to speak to Daisy alone,” he insisted. “She’s all excited now ——”**

**“Even alone I can’t say I never loved Tom,” she admitted in a pitiful voice.**

**“It wouldn’t be true.”**

**“Of course it wouldn’t,” agreed Tom.**

**She turned to her husband.**

**“As if it mattered to you,” she said.**

**“Of course it matters. I’m going to take better care of you from now on.”**

**“You don’t understand,” said Gatsby, with a touch of panic.**

**“You’re not going to take care of her any more.”**

**“I’m not?” Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed.**

**He could afford to control himself now.**

**“Why’s that?”**

**“Daisy’s leaving you.” “Nonsense.”**

**“I am, though,” she said with a visible effort.**

**“She’s not leaving me!” Tom’s words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby.**

**“Certainly not for a common swindler who’d have to steal the ring he put on her finger.”**

**“I won’t stand this!” cried Daisy. “Oh, please let’s get out.”**

**“Who are you, anyhow?” broke out Tom.**

**“You’re one of that bunch that hangs around with Meyer Wolfsheim— that much I happen to know. I’ve made a little investigation into your affairs — and I’ll carry it further to-morrow.”**

**“You can suit yourself about that, old sport,” said Gatsby steadily.**

**“I found out what your ‘drug-stores’ were.”**

**He turned to us and spoke rapidly.**

**“He and this Wolfsheim bought up a lot of side-street drug-stores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter.**

**That’s one of his little stunts.**

> ==stunt英 [stʌnt] 美 [stʌnt] n. 噱头，手腕；绝技==

**I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw him, and I wasn’t far wrong.”**

**“What about it?” said Gatsby politely.**

**“I guess your friend Walter Chase wasn’t too proud to come in on it.”**

**“And you left him in the lurch, didn’t you? You let him go to jail for a month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the subject of you.”**

**“He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old sport.”**

**“Don’t you call me ‘old sport’!” cried Tom.**

**Gatsby said nothing.**

**“Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but Wolfsheim scared him into shutting his mouth.”**

**That unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby’s face.**

**“That drug-store business was just small change,” continued Tom slowly, “but you’ve got something on now that Walter’s afraid to tell me about.”**

**I glanced at Daisy, who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her husband, and at Jordan, who had begun to balance an invisible but absorbing object on the tip of her chin.**

**Then I turned back to Gatsby — and was startled at his expression.**

**He looked — and this is said in all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden — as if he had “killed a man.”**

> <font color=red>He looked — / and this is said / in all contempt/ for the babbled slander / of his garden — / as if he had “killed a man.”</font>

**For a moment the set of his face could be described in just that fantastic way.**

**It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything, defending his name against accusations that had not been made.**

**But with every word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave that up,**

**and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room.**

**“please, Tom! I can’t stand this any more.”**

**Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage, she had had, were definitely gone.**

**“You two start on home, Daisy,” said Tom. “In Mr. Gatsby’s car.”**

### 背景知识

**💧1. Mint julep 薄荷茱莉普**

“Open the whiskey, Tom,” she ordered, “and I’ll make you a mint julep. Then you won’t seem so stupid to yourself. . . . Look at the mint!”（"打开威士忌，汤姆，"她命令道，"我给你做一杯薄荷酒。然后你就个会觉得自己那么蠢了……你看这些薄荷叶子！"）

薄荷茱莉普（Mint julep）是鸡尾酒（cocktail）的一种，喝完后可以消除口中的苦味。这种酒一般由四种成分混合而成：薄荷叶（mint leaf）, 波旁威士忌（bourbon）, 单糖浆（simple syrup）, 碎冰（crushed ice）.

同时为了保持冰爽的口感，一般用银杯或锡杯盛装（often served in silver or pewter cups）; 而且端起来的时候只接触上端或底部的边缘（held only by the bottom and top edges of the cup）, 这样就可以保证杯子外面附上一层白霜啦~ 而现在，对杯子则没有那么挑剔，装在highball杯、collins杯和old-fashioned杯中，并插上吸管的Mint Julep已经很普遍了。

薄荷茱莉普诞生于美国南方，时间大约是18世纪。julep从西班牙语julepe变形而来（语源是阿拉伯语），原义指sweet drink, 因为味道甘甜而用于辅助服药（a vehicle for medicine）. 

**💧2. Libertine 浪荡子**

The transition from libertine to prig was so complete.（一个酒徒色鬼竟然摇身一变就成了道学先生。）

libertine指“浪荡子，好色之徒”（one devoid of most moral principles, a sense of responsibility, or sexual restraints）. Libertinism也被看作是Hedonism（享乐主义）的一种极端。

libertine在14世纪从拉丁语（libertus）进入英语中，本义是指“被解放的奴隶”（freedman, a slave who had been set free）. 到16世纪，libertine指代的还包括宗教或世俗上的自由思想家（religious and secular freethinkers）, 这类人拒绝传统信仰，遵守自己的一套原则。直到17世纪，这个词才开始指“道德上放荡不羁之人”（unstrained in moral situations）.

历史上有一个著名的浪荡子人物—— 十七世纪诗人约翰·威尔姆（John Wilmot）, 人称罗彻斯特伯爵二世（2nd Earl of Rochester），以放荡堕落英年早逝闻名，死后他的作品才受到各界注意与褒扬。他的一生短促而狂野，作为当时世人眼中诡计多端且天赋异秉的无耻之徒，他不仅成为英国历史中不可或缺的好事者、才华横溢的天才，还是对自由最坚信不移的浪荡子。

法国的一位导演根据以他的故事为原型的小说改编了一部电影，名字就叫*The Libertine*.

这里Nick讽刺Tom原本是一个浪荡之徒，结果摇身变成一副道貌岸然的样子。

### 课文理解

在今天的内容里，故事中的三角矛盾终于到了爆发的一刻。首先是Tom揭露了Gatsby所从事的非法生意——买通药房后售卖私酒。但这里除了印证前文对Gatsby的猜测，Tom还无意透露了一个细节，也就是他的朋友也曾经跟Gatsby合伙。可见名贵之流并不如Tom所自恃的那样道德正义——



💧**Clue 1**: People from upper class also participate in illegal business.



**Evidence 1**: “He and this Wolfsheim bought up a lot of side-street drug-stores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter. ”

"他和这个姓沃尔夫山姆的家伙在本地和芝加哥买下了许多小街上的药房，私自把酒精卖给人家喝。"



**Evidence 2**: “And you left him in the lurch, didn’t you? You let him go to jail for a month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the subject of you.”

"你们还把他坑了，是不是？你们让他在新泽西州坐了一个月监牢。天啊！你应当听听瓦尔特议论你的那些话。"



Walter就是Tom的一位朋友，和Gatsby合伙后挣了不少钱，结果不幸被捕入狱。后来他还打算向警方举报Gatsby和Wolfsheim, 但是在受到Wolfsheim的恐吓后没有招供。（“Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but Wolfsheim scared him into shutting his mouth.”）

听到这里，Daisy不仅是惊诧，恐怕已经吓得花容失色了（I glanced at Daisy, who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her husband, and at Jordan…）她的高贵自尊绝不会容忍自己的情人从事的竟然是违法的生意。

但这只是她拒绝Gatsby的原因之一，根本的问题在于，她自始至终都没有想过和Gatsby复合——



💧**Clue 2**: Daisy's sole intention is to get back at Tom.



**Evidence 1**: “Oh, you want too much!” she cried to Gatsby. “I love you now — isn’t that enough? I can’t help what’s past.” She began to sob helplessly. “I did love him once — but I loved you too.”

"啊，你的要求太过分了！"她对盖茨比喊道，"我现在爱你——难道这还不够吗？过去的事我没法挽回。"她无可奈何地抽抽噎噎哭了起来。"我曾经爱过他——但那时候我也爱着你。"



**Evidence 2**: “Daisy’s leaving you.” “Nonsense.” “I am, though,” she said with a visible effort.

"黛西要离开你了。" "胡说八道。" "不过我确实要离开你。"她显然很费劲地说。



这两段对话发生在Tom抖露Gatsby从事非法生意之前。Daisy无法否认自己完全不爱Tom, 所以可以明确的是，Gatsby对Daisy来说，更多时候只是一颗棋子，一颗她用来“操纵”Tom，并且挽回自己的婚姻和家庭地位的棋子。

最后Tom勒令Daisy坐上Gatsby的车回家，然后两人黯然离开。（They were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental, isolated, like ghosts, even from our pity.）

### 今日彩蛋

**💧Heartbroken scenes in literature** 



原文出现了一幕很心碎的场景：Gatsby质问Daisy “You loved me too?” 结果Tom立马插嘴说 “Why — there’re things between Daisy and me that you’ll never know, things that neither of us can ever forget.”

Tom的话刺痛了Gatsby的心，并且原文用了一个很直观但形象的表达：The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.

今天的彩蛋我们就来看一看在英文名著里有哪些描述心碎的片段~



\1. Anne of Green Gables, L.M. Montgomery

《绿山墙的安妮》 露西·莫德·蒙哥马利



There is no use in loving things if you have to be torn from them. Is there? And it's so hard to keep from loving things, isn't it?

因为爱一个人而受到伤害有什么意义呢？但不去爱又真的很难，不是吗？



这一段也和王尔德的一句名言有异曲同工之妙：

The heart was made to be broken.

Remedy: It’s tempting to try and protect your heart to keep it from ever breaking. But! A heart that's never used is also broken.

人会出于本能地保护自己的心免受破碎之苦。但是，如果你连尝试爱的勇气都没有，那么你也会感受到心碎之苦。



\2. The Little Mermaid, Hans Christian Andersen

《海的女儿》 汉斯·克里斯蒂安·安徒生



Never had she danced so beautifully; the sharp knives cut her feet, but she did not feel it, for the pain in her heart was far greater.

她从没有跳得那么美；锋利的刀伤到了她的脚，但是她没有感觉到，因为她的心远比伤口痛。



Remedy: Because to live is to be hurt, although that shouldn't ever stop you from doing all that awful, wonderful, bittersweet living.

虽然活着就会受伤，但你依然要经历这同时糟糕、美好、苦乐参半的生活。



\3. Heartburn, Nora Ephron

《心痛》 诺拉·伊佛朗



And then the dreams break into a million tiny pieces. The dream dies, which leaves you with achoice: you can settle for reality, or you can go off, like a fool, and dream another dream.

然后美梦变得支离破碎，碎成几百万个小碎片。梦碎了，你也必须选择，是因为现实而安定下来，还是像个傻瓜一样、去追寻另一个梦。



Remedy: Things end. They do. They die and they fade and they wither or they just went away when you weren't paying attention. The foolish thing to do is go after a new beginning. So go out and be a fool. It's so worth it.

所有事都有终结。你没留意的时候，它们死亡、淡出记忆、枯萎或离去。重新开始或许看起来很傻，但这值得。所以别担心：就去做个傻瓜吧，因为它值得。



\4. My Mortal Enemy, Willa Cather

《不共戴天的仇敌》 薇拉·凯瑟



People can be lovers and enemies at the same time, you know.

你知道吗，人可以同时是情人和敌人。



Remedy: You are all too aware that you can adore someone with your whole stupid heart, and yet hate them with your whole entire mind. Someone can be right AND wrong for you.

你很清楚，自己可以用那愚蠢的心去溺爱一个人；但是恨他们的时候，用的却是你的整个大脑。有的人对你来说，既对又错。



\5. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Betty Smith

《布鲁克林有棵树》 贝蒂·史密斯



Oh, you'll be happy, again, never fear. But you won't forget. Every time you fall in love it will be because something in the man reminds you of him.

哦，别担心，你会再次快乐起来的，但是你不会忘记这段感情。每当你爱上新的人，都只是因为这人身上有他的影子。



Remedy: The people you love, the people you'vespend time with and energy on, leave an imprint on you. The silver lining? It's often up to us whether that means we're worse off or changed for the better.

你爱的人，为之花时间精力的人，都在你的心里留下深深的印记。乌云背后也会有幸福线，很多时候失恋后是好是坏，取决于我们自己。

**So we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight.**

**The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the ash heaps was the principal witness at the inquest.**

**He had slept through the heat until after five, when he strolled over to the garage, and found George Wilson sick in his office — really sick, pale as his own pale hair and shaking all over.**

**Michaelis advised him to go to bed, but Wilson refused, saying that he’d miss a lot of business if he did.**

**While his neighbor was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke out overhead.**

**“I’ve got my wife locked in up there,” explained Wilson calmly.**

**“She’s going to stay there till the day after to-morrow, and then we’re going to move away.”**

**Michaelis was astonished; they had been neighbors for four years, and Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement.**

> *such a statement指上文Mr. Wilson说：“I’ve got my wife locked in up there,” explained Wilson calmly. “She’s going to stay there till the day after to-morrow, and then we’re going to move away.” 因为他从来都是一副受太太支使的样子（He was his wife’s man and not his own.）所以邻居对他竟然把太太关在屋子里感到吃惊。

**Generally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn’t working, he sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed along the road.**

**When any one spoke to him he invariably laughed in an agreeable, colorless way.**

**He was his wife’s man and not his own.**

**So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson wouldn’t say a word — instead he began to throw curious, suspicious glances at his visitor and ask him what he’d been doing at certain times on certain days.**

**Just as the latter was getting uneasy, some workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant, and Michaelis took the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later.**

**But he didn’t.**

**He supposed he forgot to, that’s all.**

**When he came outside again, a little after seven, he was reminded of the conversation because he heard Mrs. Wilson’s voice, loud and scolding, down-stairs in the garage.**

**“Beat me!” he heard her cry.**

**“Throw me down and beat me, you dirty little coward!”**

**A moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and shouting — before he could move from his door the business was over.**

**The “death car,” as the newspapers called it, didn’t stop; it came out of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment, and then disappeared around the next bend.**

**Michaelis wasn’t even sure of its color — he told the first policeman that it was light green.**

**The other car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards beyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark blood with the dust.**

**Michaelis and this man reached her first, but when they had torn open her shirtwaist, still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap, and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath.**

**The mouth was wide open and ripped at the corners, as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long.**

**We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still some distance away.**

**“Wreck!” said Tom.**

**“That’s good. Wilson’ll have a little business at last.”**

**He slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping, until, as we came nearer, the hushed, intent faces of the people at the garage door made him automatically put on the brakes.**

**“We’ll take a look,” he said doubtfully, “just a look.”**

**I became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly from the garage,**

**a sound which as we got out of the coupe and walked toward the door resolved itself into the words “Oh, my God!” uttered over and over in a gasping moan.**

**“There’s some bad trouble here,” said Tom excitedly.**

**He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the garage, which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging wire basket overhead.**

**Then he made a harsh sound in his throat, and with a violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through.**

**The circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it was a minute before I could see anything at all.**

**“Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! oh, Ga-od! oh, my Ga-od!”**

**“No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster’n forty. Going fifty, sixty.”**

**“Come here and let’s have your name. Look out now. I want to get his name.”**

**Some words of this conversation must have reached Wilson, swaying in the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his gasping cries:**

**“You don’t have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of car it was!”**

**Watching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten under his coat.**

**He walked quickly over to Wilson and, standing in front of him, seized him firmly by the upper arms.**

**“You’ve got to pull yourself together,” he said with soothing gruffness.**

**Wilson’s eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.**

### 背景知识

**💧Coffee joint 廉价咖啡馆**

The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the ash heaps was the principal witness at the inquest.（那个年轻的希腊人米切里斯，在灰堆旁边开小咖啡馆的，是验尸时主要的见证人。）

joint指“廉价酒吧（俱乐部，餐厅）”（a cheap bar, club, or restaurant）.



和joint不同的是clip joint, 也称作fleshpot, 专门指“（索价昂贵，敲竹杠）的夜总会”（a night club where customers are tricked into paying excessive amounts of money）.

 

这些地方往往服务质量和态度恶劣（with surprisingly low-grade goods or services）, 在酒里掺水（watering-down alcoholic drinks）或是驱逐不愿意多花钱的顾客轰出门（throwing out customers when they become unwilling or unable to spend more money）都是常有的事。

而他们能够如此嚣张跋扈，也是因为顾客们本身来这些地方消费就属于违法行为，所以只能忍气吞声而不敢向警方举报（since its victims cannot report the venue without admitting that they broke the law）.

在1920到1933年美国举国上下实行禁酒令的期间，这类夜总会遍地都是。后来纽约州酒类管理局出台了对非法售卖酒品以及欺诈消费者的夜总会的惩罚措施（The New York State Liquor Authority has imposed penalties against any licensed premises permitting such conduct）.

今天英国伦敦的Soho区依然聚集了大量的clip joints（也叫作near beer bars），一般开在合法的脱衣舞吧旁边（alongside legitimate strip bars）. 但是自从2007年这一片被划为红灯区后，便受到法律的严格监管，必须执照经营（licences are required）.

### 课文理解

Myrtle和丈夫发生激烈的争吵后冲出屋子跑到了马路上，结果被飞驰而来的汽车撞倒在地，当场毙命。随后向西卵返程的Tom一行人正好遇上这个惨剧，此时Mr. Wilson已经精神崩溃无法自控。在今天的内容里有两个值得关注的点，首先是Mr. Wilson为什么始终没有发现Myrtle的出轨对象是Tom, 以及所谓的肇事车辆the "death car"对本书的主题有什么暗示意义。



💧**Clue 1**: Why does Mr. Wilson fail to notice Myrtle and Tom's affair?



最直接的原因是Mr. Wilson一直专注于和Tom的交易，以至于从来没有猜想他的另一个身份——Myrtle的秘密情人。另一个原因是，Mr. Wilson长年生活在灰谷，和Tom所处的上流社会圈完全隔绝（no access to Tom's social circles），所以即便Tom平日里带着Myrtle四处招摇，Mr. Wilson对此也毫无察觉。

 

文中还有一个细节，当邻居想了解他为什么会把自己的太太关起来的时候，他本能的反应是把这位邻居当成出轨的嫌疑对象——



**Evidence 1**:  So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson wouldn’t say a word — instead he began to throw curious, suspicious glances at his visitor and ask him what he’d been doing at certain times on certain days.

因此，米切里斯很自然地想了解发生了什么事，但威尔逊一个字也不肯说——相反地，他却用古怪的、怀疑的目光端详起这位客人来，并且盘问他某些日子某些时间在干什么。



Mr. Wilson的悲剧性很大程度来源于他的社会阶层。他属于被工业文明遗弃的灰谷，在汽车行业流水线上最不起眼的一个位置，做着每天机械的工作，慢慢变得愚钝、麻木。而他急切想得到Tom的二手车，想靠这个赚上一笔，却反复遭受Tom的戏弄。最后，“汽车”成为了他太太死亡的致命凶器——



💧**Clue 2**: Automobile is a symbol of injury and death.



**Evidence 1**: The “death car,” as the newspapers called it, didn’t stop; it came out of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment, and then disappeared around the next bend.

那辆"凶车"——这是报纸上的提法——停都没停车于从渐浓的暮色中出现，出事后悲惨地犹疑了片刻，然后在前面一转弯就不见了。



作为一种威胁，小说中的汽车造成了各种各样的伤害：

Jordan开车擦破过工人的纽扣；（It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one man’s coat. — Chapter 3.4）

Gatsby派对上的一位客人压坏过醉汉的右手；（Snell was there three days before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel drive that Mrs. Ulysses Swett’s automobile ran over his right hand. — Chapter 4.1）

运送过死人，当过灵车；（A dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two carriages with drawn blinds, and by more cheerful carriages for friends. — Chapter 4.2）

Tom车上的一位酒店女佣撞断过胳膊；（The girl who was with him got into the papers, too, because her arm was broken — she was one of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel. — Chapter 4.4）

因此，在故事的高潮处，汽车自然而然的充当了刽子手，这是一辆“致死”的汽车，是死亡的运输者，它必会带来死亡。

**💧Things to know by the time you turn 30**

Nick突然意识到自己已经30岁了，这给他带来了恐慌和不安（Thirty — the promise of a decade of loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning brief-case of enthusiasm, thinning hair. ）

除了没有任何物质或其他方面的成就外，他在这个节点上还经历着对社会、对人性的困惑。但很快我们就会在Nick的身上看到，真正迈入30岁的标志，不在年龄，不在财富地位，而在于心智的成熟和稳定。

今日份的彩蛋我们分享的是一些最好能在30岁之前就知道的处世做人原则，它们不是进入30岁的门槛，也没法让我们一劳永逸地消除焦虑，但懂得这些原则，可以让我们无论处在哪个年龄段 ，都能有更开阔的眼界和心胸。



\1. You can do whatever you want in life.

精诚所至，金石为开

There are step by step ways to accomplish any goal. If it has been accomplished by someone else, all you have to do is choose your virtual mentor and follow in his or her footsteps.



If you are doing something that has not been done before, it is more challenging but your path can be mapped out if you take note of the things that have worked for you and those that have not. Do the things that work and pitch the ones that don't.



\2. You are responsible for every action you take in life and every condition your life is in.

做自己的选择，过自己的人生



Try to ask yourself “Who is the most motivated person to see that your life works out the way you want it to?” The answer is YOU.



So the next question is, “Who is really going to take responsibility to ensure that your life works out the way you want it to?” Again, there is only one answer.



It is YOU who makes all of the bajillion everyday decisions that drive your life.



\3. Not everyone who is an “authority” is right.

没有人是绝对“权威”



Take the following as an example and apply it to in other cases:



Whenever anyone gives you any data, check it over for yourself and see if it works for you and seems correct. If it doesn't seem correct, don't rely on it.



There is more false data out there than true data. You just have to figure out which is which.



\4. Do not seek revenge.

以直报怨，以德报德



Revenge for the sake of revenge never feels good when it is carried out and, believe it or not, it ties you to the person that you have taken revenge against. You will never be free of that person in your thoughts and mind thereafter.



Sometimes you do have to act against a person to stop the damage they are wreaking on others. This is a correct action in the grand scheme of things. But revenge just for revenge's sake is evil. I don't care how many movies make it seem okay.



\5. Life is fluid.

生活需要变通



Life changes every second of every day. If you have fixed ideas about how it is supposed to be and how you will handle things, you will take wrong steps. 



In any given situation, look at it and really see it. Plan your actions accordingly. Operating on fixed ideas and actions will only take you so far. Actual observation and action is always best.



## **Chapter 7.6**

**“Listen,” said Tom, shaking him a little.**

**“I just got here a minute ago, from New York.**

**I was bringing you that coupe we’ve been talking about.**

**That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn’t mine — do you hear?**

**I haven’t seen it all afternoon.”**

**Only the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said, but the policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent eyes.**

**“What’s all that?” he demanded.**

**“I’m a friend of his.” Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on Wilson’s body.**

**“He says he knows the car that did it . . . it was a yellow car.”**

**Some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.**

**“And what color’s your car?”**

**“It’s a blue car, a coupe.”**

**“We’ve come straight from New York,” I said.**

**Some one who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this, and the policeman turned away.**

**“Now, if you’ll let me have that name again correct ——”**

**Picking up Wilson like a doll, Tom carried him into the office, set him down in a chair, and came back.**

**“If somebody’ll come here and sit with him,” he snapped authoritatively.**

**He watched while the two men standing closest glanced at each other and went unwillingly into the room.**

**Then Tom shut the door on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the table.**

**As he passed close to me he whispered: “Let’s get out.”**

**Self-consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way,we pushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor, case in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.**

> <font color=red>Self-consciously, / with his authoritative arms /breaking the way, / we pushed through the still gathering crowd, / passing a hurried doctor, / case in hand, / who had been sent for / in wild hope / half an hour ago.</font>

> **💧句式拆解**
>
> ①with his authoritative arms breaking the way 属于独立主格结构（his authoritative arms作主语）, 分析句子结构的时候可以省略这部分；
>
> ②所以整个句子的主体部分是：Self-consciously, we pushed through..., passing a hurried doctor..., who...
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①self-consciously 从字面上理解是“有自我意识地”，引申为“〔因顾虑自己的外表或他人的看法〕忸怩的，不自然的”，比如：Jerry’s pretty self-conscious about his weight.
>
> 杰里很在意自己的体重。
>
> *这里指Tom和Nick从围观的人群穿过感觉非常不自在。（注意self-consciously是做we的状语~）
>
> ②with his authoritative arms “他威武的双臂”；authoritative本义指“权威的，威严的”，这里形容Tom的动作非常强势；
>
> ③been sent for “被请来”；send for sb指“派人去叫sb, 请sb来”，比如：Send for a doctor, quickly! 
>
> 请个大夫来，快！
>
> ④in wild hope “抱着一线希望”；wild在这里指“没什么可能性的”（based on little or no probability）, 相当于我们前面介绍的faint哦~

**Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend — then his foot came down hard, and the coupe raced along through the night.**

**In a little while I heard a low husky sob, and saw that the tears were overflowing down his face.**

**“The God damned coward!” he whimpered.**

**“He didn’t even stop his car.”**

**The Buchanans’ house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling trees.**

**Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor, where two windows bloomed with light among the vines.**

**“Daisy’s home,” he said.**

**As we got out of the car he glanced at me and frowned slightly.**

**“I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There’s nothing we can do to-night.”**

**A change had come over him, and he spoke gravely, and with decision.**

**As we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of the situation in a few brisk phrases.**

> 当我们穿过满地月光的石子道走向门廊时，他三言两语很利索地处理了眼前的情况。

> 💧dispose后面不加任何介词的时候相当于arrange, 指“排列，布置”；但dispose更常见的用法是和of搭配，表示“处理，丢弃”（to get rid of）, 比如：They dispose of the city's waste in the sea.

>
> 💧还可以表示“解决，应付”（to deal with）, 比如：Your idea at least disposes of the immediate problem.

**“I’ll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you’re waiting you and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some supper — if you want any.”**

**He opened the door. “Come in.”**

**“No, thanks. But I’d be glad if you’d order me the taxi. I’ll wait outside.”**

**Jordan put her hand on my arm.**

**“Won’t you come in, Nick?” “No, thanks.”**

**I was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan lingered for a moment more.**

**“It’s only half-past nine,” she said.**

**I’d be damned if I’d go in; I’d had enough of all of them for one day, and suddenly that included Jordan too.**

**She must have seen something of this in my expression, for she turned abruptly away and ran up the porch steps into the house.**

**I sat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler’s voice calling a taxi.**

**Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the house, intending to wait by the gate.**

**I hadn’t gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from between two bushes into the path.**

**I must have felt pretty weird by that time, because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit under the moon.**

**“What are you doing?” I inquired.**

**“Just standing here, old sport.”**

**Somehow, that seemed a despicable occupation.**

**“Did you see any trouble on the road?” he asked after a minute.**

**“Yes.” He hesitated.**

**“Was she killed?” “Yes.”**

**“I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It’s better that the shock should all come at once. She stood it pretty well.”**

**He spoke as if Daisy’s reaction was the only thing that mattered.**

**“I got to West Egg by a side road,” he went on, “and left the car in my garage. I don’t think anybody saw us, but of course I can’t be sure.”**

**I disliked him so much by this time that I didn’t find it necessary to tell him he was wrong.**

**“Who was the woman?” he inquired.**

**“Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did it happen?”**

**“Well, I tried to swing the wheel ——” He broke off, and suddenly I guessed at the truth.**

**“Was Daisy driving?”**

**“Yes,” he said after a moment, “but of course I’ll say I was. You see, when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would steady her to drive — and this woman rushed out at us just as we were passing a car coming the other way.**

**It all happened in a minute, but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody she knew.**

**Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back.**

**The second my hand reached the wheel I felt the shock — it must have killed her instantly.”**

**“It ripped her open ——”**

**“Don’t tell me, old sport.” He winced.**

**“Anyhow — Daisy stepped on it. I tried to make her stop, but she couldn’t, so I pulled on the emergency brake.**

**Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.**

**“She’ll be all right to-morrow,” he said presently.**

**“I’m just going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon.**

**She’s locked herself into her room, and if he tries any brutality she’s going to turn the light out and on again.”**

> ==brutality英 [brʊ'tælɪtɪ] 美 [bruˈtælɪti] n. 无情；残忍；暴行（需用复数形式）==

**“He won’t touch her,’ I said.**

**“He’s not thinking about her.”**

**“I don’t trust him, old sport.”**

**“How long are you going to wait?”**

**“All night, if necessary. Anyhow, till they all go to bed.”**

**A new point of view occurred to me.**

**Suppose Tom found out that Daisy had been driving.**

**He might think he saw a connection in it — he might think anything.**

**I looked at the house; there were two or three bright windows down-stairs and the pink glow from Daisy’s room on the second floor.**

**“You wait here,” I said. “I’ll see if there’s any sign of a commotion.”**

> ==commotion英 [kə'məʊʃ(ə)n] 美 [kəˈmoʊʃn] n. 骚动；暴乱==

**I walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel softly,and tiptoed up the veranda steps.**

**The drawing-room curtains were open, and I saw that the room was empty.**

**Crossing the porch where we had dined that June night three months before, I came to a small rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window.**

**The blind was drawn, but I found a rift at the sill.**

**Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table, with a plate of cold fried chicken between them, and two bottles of ale.**

**He was talking intently across the table at her, and in his earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own.**

> ==earnestness英 ['ə:nistnis] 美 ['ɜ:nɪstnəs] n. 认真；诚挚；正经==

**Once in a while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.**

**They weren’t happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the ale — and yet they weren’t unhappy either.**

**There was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the picture, and anybody would have said that they were conspiring together.**

**As I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the dark road toward the house.**

**Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in the drive.**

**“Is it all quiet up there?” he asked anxiously.**

**“Yes, it’s all quiet.” I hesitated.**

**“You’d better come home and get some sleep.” He shook his head.**

**“I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport.”**

**He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil.**

### 背景知识

**💧Trespassing law in America**

**小心别犯了“非法入侵罪”**

我们先来回顾原文当中出现的一个场景：

I walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel softly, and tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains were open, and I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where we had dined that June night three months before, I came to a small rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window. The blind was drawn, but I found a rift at the sill.

我沿着草坪的边缘走了回去，轻轻跨过石子车道，然后踮起脚尖走上游廊的台阶。客厅的窗帘是拉开的，因此我看到屋子里是空的。我穿过我们三个月以前那个六月的晚上吃过晚餐的阳台，来到一小片长方形的灯光前面，我猜那是食品间的窗户。遮帘拉了下来，但我在窗台上找到了一个缝隙。

Nick为了帮Gatsby打探屋里的情况，悄悄地重新潜回到门口，还从窗外往里偷窥。但是这个举动在现实生活中可不值得效仿，否则随时有可能被扣上“非法入侵罪”的帽子。

私闯民宅，在美国称为“Trespassing”. 由于美国大部分的住宅，都是别墅式的，所以在四周又有花园。有的园子很大，是几公顷甚至几百公顷。除了住宅以外，店铺，办公室等地点，亦属“私宅”。

美国是私有制国家，保护私人的财产不受侵犯或打扰，是美国民生之大法。走在美国的街道上，观赏美丽的小区或商业街，你要想到：这一切你所看到的，均为私有财产。

对于这些“私宅”，美国法律明文规定，任何人，包括执法机关，没有正当理由，不许对其进行任何骚扰。（注：私宅，包括房子的前门和外边通往大街的阶梯。）

### 课文理解

昨天我们介绍了death car作为本书重要的象征之一，代表了伤害和死亡（injury and death）. 今天我们会从Myrtle死亡本身出发，揭示这一事件和美国梦主题之间的关系。



💧**Clue 1**: Myrtle's death indicates the false promise of American dream.

Myrtle在故事里的形象几乎完全就是“物欲”（physicality）的代表，她是灰谷里脱颖而出的一个不甘于现状并且渴望进入上流社会的代表（和她的丈夫完全相反）。她急于摆脱自己卑微的阶层地位，希冀能借助Tom实现麻雀变凤凰的梦想。

所以当她和丈夫发生争吵时，她本能地向以为是Tom正在驾驶的汽车跑去（早些时候她透过窗户看到Tom开着黄色的车，所以当Daisy和Gatsby开着那辆黄色的车回程的时候，Myrtle便误以为里面坐的是Tom）——



**Evidence 1**: “It all happened in a minute, but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody she knew.”

"前后不到一分钟的事，但我觉得她想跟我们说话，以为我们是她认识的人。"

虽然Tom不是直接的凶手，但这一幕也颇具象征意义——Myrtle所迫切渴望的名利财富（这是汽车在本书中的另一个象征，可以回看前文对Gatsby这辆黄色小轿车的描述，它是Gatsby自我炫耀的工具之一）最后成为了她的致命凶器。

她永远无法进入Tom的阶层，即便当时开车的是Tom, 即便Tom停了下来，他也不会带Myrtle离开，或是为了她和Daisy离婚。Myrtle的尝试和努力注定是无用的，而且还造成了她最后的悲剧。因此作者想要表达的是，美国梦其实是残忍而虚假的，妄图追寻它并且深陷其中的人，最后遭遇的可能是粉身碎骨。

Myrtle的悲剧命运其实也是本书的另一个角色——Gatsby的预言。他怀抱着比Myrtle更为强烈真挚的浪漫幻想，甚至可以说飞蛾扑火、自我牺牲式的。比如今天的情节里，他默默无闻地站在Daisy家外的灌木丛里守望——



💧**Clue 2**: Gatsby's love for Daisy is self-sacrificing.



**Evidence 1**: “She’ll be all right to-morrow,” he said presently. “I’m just going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon. She’s locked herself into her room, and if he tries any brutality she’s going to turn the light out and on again.”

"明天她就会好的，"他过了一会又说，"我只是在这儿等等，看他会不会因为今天下午那场争执找她麻烦。她把自己锁在自己屋子里了，假如他有什么野蛮的举动，她就会把灯关掉然后再打开。"

显然Gatsby和Daisy约定好了，如果Tom有什么异常的举动，Daisy会用灯光来告知Gatsby. 但即便是Nick在踏进院子透过窗户观察里面的动向，发现一切都非常平和的时候，Gatsby也不愿意离开，坚持要等到Daisy关灯入睡（“I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport”）.

Gatsby的执着虔诚甚至已经让Nick觉得仿佛自己如果再打扰他，就会侵犯了这份守望的“神圣性”（as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil）. 这份付出是否会得到相应的回报？Nick在末尾留下的轻描淡写的一句埋下了伏笔：

So I walked away and left him standing there in the moonlight — watching over nothing.

### 今日彩蛋

**💧nerve的俚语表达**



Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back.（呃，黛西先是把车子从那个女人那边转向那辆车子，接着她惊慌失措又转了回去。）

 

to lose one's nerve 指“（因为太害怕）而没有勇气做”（to suddenly become very nervous so that you cannot do what you intended to do）. 这里指Daisy本来是要往另外一辆车撞过去的，但最后因为太害怕而调转了方向。

 

关于nerve还有很多俚语表达，我们一起来看看~



\1. to have a lot of nerve

行事莽撞粗鲁

nerve在这里相当于口语里的cheek, 表示“ 令人讨厌（或粗鲁、无礼）的话（或行为） ”，比如：What a cheek/nerve!（“真不要脸！”）

"You took my seat! You have a lot of nerve sitting there!"（你占了我的位置！你坐在这真是厚颜无耻 ！）



\2. to hit / touch a (raw) nerve 

触及要害/痛处

指无意间说了让别人不高兴或是令人尴尬的话（to accidentally upset someone by talking about something that they feel strongly about or are very sensitive about）.

You touched a raw nerve when you mentioned his first wife.

你谈起他的第一个妻子，这就触到了他的痛处。



\3. to have nerves of steel 

意志坚强；沉着冷静 

nerves of steel “像钢铁一般的神经（意志）”，也就是非常“坚强、冷静”（to be able to remain calm in a difficult or dangerous situation）.

The job requires nerves of steel.

做这份工作需要有坚强的意志。



\4. to get on one's nerves 

使心神不宁

一般指“某件事一直在重复而令人感觉心烦”（to annoy somebody by doing something all the time）.

She’s always moaning. It really gets on my nerves.

她老是在哼哼唧唧的，真令我心烦。



\5. to be a bundle of nerves / a bag of nerves

极度焦虑/恐惧

nerves在这里指“种种担心的情绪”（worried feelings）, 也就是形容一个人“浑身每根神经都处于焦虑和紧张当中”。

I remember you were a bundle of nerves on your wedding day.

我记得你在婚礼那天紧张极了。
