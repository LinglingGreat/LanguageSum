**It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday night — and, as obscurely as it had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over.**

**Only gradually did I become aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away.**

> <font color=red>Only gradually / did I become aware / that the automobiles / which turned expectantly into his drive / stayed for just a minute / and then drove sulkily away.</font>

> ①turned expectantly into his drive “那些乘兴而来的一辆辆汽车”；expectantly指“满心期待地”（with an excited feeling that something is about to happen）; into his drive “开到Gatsby的私人车道上”，drive指“〔房屋与街道之间的〕私人车道”；
>
> ②sulkily “生闷气地，扫兴地”，比如：'You haven't got the right attitude,' he said sulkily.
>
> 他怄气道：“你态度不端正。”
>
> *这些人满怀欣喜地像以往一样准备来参加派对，在发现没有派对后又悻悻地走了。

**Wondering if he were sick I went over to find out — an unfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door.**

> ==villainous英 ['vɪlənəs] 美 [ˈvɪlənəs] adj. 罪恶的；恶棍的；恶毒的；坏透的==
>
> ==squint英 [skwɪnt] 美 [skwɪnt] vi. 眯眼看；斜视；窥视；偏移==

**“Is Mr. Gatsby sick?”**

**“Nope.” After a pause he added “sir”in a dilatory, grudging way.**

> ==dilatory adj. 拖拉的；缓慢的，不慌不忙的==
>
> ==grudging英 ['grʌdʒɪŋ] 美 [ˈɡrʌdʒɪŋ] adj. 勉强的；吝啬的==

**“I hadn’t seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell him Mr. Carraway came over.”**

**“Who?” he demanded rudely.**

**“Carraway.” “Carraway. All right, I’ll tell him.” Abruptly he slammed the door.**

**My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never went into West Egg Village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered moderate supplies over the telephone.**

**The grocery boy reported that the kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the village was that the new people weren’t servants at all.**

**Next day Gatsby called me on the phone.**

**“Going away?” I inquired.**

**“No, old sport.”**

**“I hear you fired all your servants.”**

**“I wanted somebody who wouldn’t gossip. Daisy comes over quite often — in the afternoons.”**

**So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval in her eyes.**

> <font color=red>So the whole caravansary / had fallen in / like a card house / at the disapproval in her eyes.</font>
>
> 如此说来，因为她不喜欢，这座大酒店就像纸牌搭的房子一样整个坍掉了。

> ①the whole caravansary “这座大酒店”，caravansary可以指过去的那种商队客栈，也可以指路边的酒店（相当于hotel）;
>
> *这里把Gatsby的房子比喻成前来寻欢作乐的人们的栖息之所。
>
> ②fall in 表示“倒塌”（to collapse）;
>
> *Daisy并不喜欢Gatsby所举办的这些浮华的派对，因为无论是派对的氛围还是前来参加的人，都触犯了Daisy身上的那种尊贵气息。这里也有讽刺的意味：仅仅因为Daisy的反对，一座如此豪华壮丽的房子就仿佛像纸牌屋一样坍塌了。

**“They’re some people Wolfsheim wanted to do something for. They’re all brothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel.”**

**“I see.” He was calling up at Daisy’s request — would I come to lunch at her house to-morrow? Miss Baker would be there.**

**Half an hour later Daisy herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was coming.**

**Something was up.**

**And yet I couldn’t believe that they would choose this occasion for a scene — especially for the rather harrowing scene that Gatsby had outlined in the garden.**

> <font color=red>And yet / I couldn’t believe / that they would choose this occasion for a scene / — especially for the rather harrowing scene / that Gatsby had outlined in the garden.</font>
>
> 然而我却不能相信他们竞然会选这样一个场合来大闹一场——尤其是盖茨比早先在花园里所提出的那种令人难堪的场面。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①choose this occasion for a scene “选这样一个场合来大闹一场”；scene在这里指“发脾气； 当众吵闹”，make a scene就是指embarrass people by publicly showing one's anger about something or doing something that is against the morals.
>
> ②the rather harrowing scene “那种令人难堪的场面”；harrowing指“折磨人的”（extremely upsetting or disturbing）.
>
> *Gatsby描绘的这个令人难堪的场面是指：He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and say: “I never loved you.” (Chapter 6.3)

**The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of the summer.**

**As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush at noon.**

> ==simmer英 ['sɪmə] 美 [ˈsɪmɚ] vi. 炖；内心充满；即将爆发==

> 原文：As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush at noon.
>
> 当我乘的火车从地道里钻出来驶进阳光里时，只有全国饼干公司热辣辣的汽笛打破了中午闷热的静寂。
>
> 💧simmering在这里指“酝酿已久的”。simmer原义是“炖，煨”，可以引申为“充满（难以控制的感情，尤指愤怒） ”，比如：She was stillsimmering with resentment.
>
> 她依旧憋着一肚子的怨恨。

**The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion; the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her fingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry.**

> 客车里的草椅垫热得简直要着火了。坐在我旁边的一个妇女起先很斯文地让汗水渗透衬衣，后来，她的报纸在她手指下面也变潮了时，她长叹一声，在酷热中颓然地往后一倒。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①hovered on the edge of combustion “热得简直要着火了”；hover表示“处于不稳定的状态”，hover on the edge of也就是“接近，快要”；比如：She hovered on the brink (=edge) of death for three months as doctors battled to save her. 
>
> 3个月来在医生们奋力挽救她的生命的过程中，她一直处在死亡的边缘。
>
> ②perspired delicately...into her white shirtwaist“很斯文地让汗水渗透衬衣”；perspire是比sweat更正式的表示“出汗”的说法；perspire delicately并不是真的“斯文地出汗”，而是诙谐地表示“微微出汗”（和后文“连报纸也变潮了”形成对比）；
>
> ③lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry “她长叹一声，在酷热中颓然地往后一倒”；lapse into表示“陷入”，比如：Alison lapsed into puzzled silence. 艾利森一头雾水，不作声了。desolate原义指“荒凉的”（deserted），还可以描述人“孤独凄凉的，忧伤的”（joyless, sorrowful）.

**Her pocket-book slapped to the floor.**

**“Oh, my!” she gasped.**

**I picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it at arm’s length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that I had no designs upon it — but everyone near by, including the woman, suspected me just the same.**

**“Hot!” said the conductor to familiar faces.**

**“Some weather! hot! hot! hot! Is it hot enough for you? Is it hot? Is it.. .?”**

**My commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand.**

> ==stain英 [steɪn] 美 [sten] vt. 玷污；败坏；给…着色==

**That any one should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed, whose head made damp the pajama pocket over his heart! . . .**

**Through the hall of the Buchanans’ house blew a faint wind, carrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at the door.**

**“The master’s body!” roared the butler into the mouthpiece.**

**“I’m sorry, madame, but we can’t furnish it — it’s far too hot to touch this noon!”**

**What he really said was: “Yes . . . yes . . . I’ll see.”**

**He set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to take our stiff straw hats.**

**“Madame expects you in the salon!” he cried, needlessly indicating the direction.**

**In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the common store of life.**

> <font color=red>In this heat / every extra gesture / was an affront to / the common store of life.</font>

**The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool.**

**Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols weighing down their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.**

**“We can’t move,” they said together.**

**Jordan’s fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment in mine.**

**“And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?” I inquired.**

**Simultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall telephone.**

**Gatsby stood in the centre of the crimson carpet and gazed around with fascinated eyes.**

> ==crimson英 ['krɪmz(ə)n] 美 [ˈkrɪmzən] n. 深红色==

**Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting laugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.**

**“The rumor is,” whispered Jordan, “that that’s Tom’s girl on the telephone.” We were silent.**

**The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance: “Very well, then, I won’t sell you the car at all. . . . I’m underno obligations to you at all . . . and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time, I won’t stand that at all!”**

**“Holding down the receiver,” said Daisy cynically.**

**“No, he’s not,” I assured her.**

**“It’s a bona-fide deal. I happen to know about it.”**

**Tom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his thick body, and hurried into the room.**

**“Mr. Gatsby!” He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed dislike.**

**“I’m glad to see you, sir. . . . Nick . . . .”**

**“Make us a cold drink,” cried Daisy.**

**As he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and pulled his face down, kissing him on the mouth.**

**“You know I love you,” she murmured.**

**“You forget there’s a lady present,” said Jordan.**

**Daisy looked around doubtfully.**

**“You kiss Nick too.”**

**“What a low, vulgar girl!”**

**“I don’t care!” cried Daisy, and began to clog on the brick fireplace.**

**Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.**

**“Bles-sed pre-cious,” she crooned, holding out her arms.**

**“Come to your own mother that loves you.”**

**The child, relinquished by the nurse,rushed across the room and rooted shyly into her mother’s dress.**

> <font color=red>relinquish英 [rɪ'lɪŋkwɪʃ] 美 [rɪˈlɪŋkwɪʃ] vt. 放弃；放手；让渡</font>

> 💧relinquish表示“放弃（尤指不情愿）”，也可以指“让出（权利，财产等）”，比如：He was forced to relinquish control of the company.
>
> 他被迫放弃对公司的控制权。

**“The bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy hair? Stand up now, and say — How-de-do.”**

**Gatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small, reluctant hand.**

**Afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise.**

**I don’t think he had ever really believed in its existence before.**

**“I got dressed before luncheon,” said the child, turning eagerly to Daisy.**

**“That’s because your mother wanted to show you off.”**

**Her face bent into the single wrinkle of the small, white neck.**

**“You dream, you. You absolute little dream.”**

**“Yes,” admitted the child calmly.**

**“Aunt Jordan’s got on a white dress too.”**

**“How do you like mother’s friends?”**

**Daisy turned her around so that she faced Gatsby.**

**“Do you think they’re pretty?”**

**“Where’s Daddy?”**

**“She doesn’t look like her father,” explained Daisy.**

**“She looks like me. She’s got my hair and shape of the face.”**

**Daisy sat back upon the couch.**

**The nurse took a step forward and held out her hand.**

**“Come, Pammy.”**

**“Good-by, sweetheart!”**

**With a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to her nurse’s hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back, preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.**

**Gatsby took up his drink.**

**“They certainly look cool,” he said, with visible tension.**

**We drank in long, greedy swallows.**

**“I read somewhere that the sun’s getting hotter every year,” said Tom genially.**

**“It seems that pretty soon the earth’s going to fall into the sun — or wait a minute — it’s just the opposite — the sun’s getting colder every year.**

**“Come outside,” he suggested to Gatsby, “I’d like you to have a look at the place.”**

### 背景知识

**💧Trimalchio 特里马尔乔**

...as obscurely as it had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over.（他作为特里马尔乔的生涯，当初莫名其妙地开始，现在又莫名其妙地结束了。）

Trimalchio（特里马尔乔）是罗马作家皮特罗尼斯作品《讽刺篇》中一个大宴宾客的暴户发（ a character in the 1st century AD Roman work of fiction Satyricon by Petronius）.  他原本是一个奴隶，被解放后通过自己的坚毅和努力得到权力和财富（freedman who through hard work and perseverance has attained power and wealth）. 他为人所知也是因为常常举办豪华的盛会宴请宾客（known for throwing lavish dinner parties）.

Trimalchio in West Egg也是Fitzegerald为这本书写的备选书名之一哦~



**💧Awning 天蓬**



The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. (这间屋子外面有这篷挡着，又阴暗又凉快。)

awning是指安置房子外墙上的用于遮阳或挡雨的天篷（a secondary covering attached to the exterior wall of a building）. 如下图↓

### 课文理解

在上次的聚会之后，人们（包括Nick）对Gatsby的好奇也渐渐越来越重了。但让大家意外的是，Gatsby的豪宅再也没有在周六的时候灯火通明过——也就是说，派对停止了。在Nick登门拜访Gatsby的时候，他才发现Gatsby还辞退了所有的仆人。而这一切举动，都是为了小心翼翼地保护他和Daisy的关系（"Daisy comes over quite often — in the afternoons."）——



💧**Clue 1**: Gatsby is discreet in protecting his affair with Daisy.



**Evidence 1**: My Finn informed me that Gatsbyad dismissed every servant in his house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never went into West Egg Village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered moderate supplies over the telephone.

我的芬兰女佣人告诉我，盖茨比早在一个星期前就辞退了家里的每一个仆人，另外雇用了五六个人，这些人从来不到西卵镇上去采购然后顺便收取店主的贿赂，而是打电话订购数量不多的生活用品。

“收取店主的贿赂”是指有些人可能想通过收买Gatsby的仆人来打听他的私人生活。足见Gatsby有多么小心谨慎了。



**Evidence 2**: They’re some people Wolfsheim wanted to do something for. They’re all brothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel.”

"他们是沃尔夫山姆要给帮点儿忙的人。他们都是兄弟姐妹。他们开过一家小旅馆。"



Nick观察到这些人似乎并不是真的仆人，比如给他开门的“仆人”是一副凶神恶煞的样子（"an unfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door"）. 根据Gatsby的透露，这些人是Wolfsheim找来的，目的是为了给他们安排一份工作。用这些人来当仆人的好处就是，他们从外地来，和West Egg的本地人自然没有接触，也就不用担心会走漏风声。

之后Nick和Gatsby一起受邀到Daisy家里做客。炎热的天气让故事氛围紧张躁动起来，与此同时，一场灾祸也正在酝酿。在这个过程中，作者也开始密集地安插预示最后悲剧的线索了。比如今天的内容中就有一个小细节揭示Gatsby的想象和现实之间的冲突——



💧**Clue 2**: Gatsby's perception is in collision with reality.



**Evidence 1**: Afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise. I don’t think he had ever really believed in its existence before.

然后他惊奇地盯着孩子看。我想他以前从来没有真正相信过有这个孩子存在。

Gatsby一直在自己的世界里重塑Daisy的形象，乃至于忘记了现实中的Daisy已经结婚并且已经有了一个可爱的女儿（从前面Daisy和女儿的互动来看她非常喜欢这个孩子）。这里Gatsby并没有作出过于激烈的反应，也许是他在努力按捺，也可能是他继续选择忽视。但随着现实逐渐迫近，他必然要面对最残酷的情况，到时候又会发生什么呢？

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****各种场合下的scene**

今天的原文里出现了用scene表示“当众吵闹”这个用法（And yet I couldn’t believe that they would choose this occasion for a scene）, 我们再来看一看scene在其他场合下还能表达什么意思~



\1. Behind the scenes 幕后

这个很好理解，scenes在这里就是指“（电视/电影）屏幕”，behind the scenes也就是指“幕后”啦~ 一般在致辞感谢的时候都会提到幕后工作人员，比如：

Let's have a round of applause for all the people who worked behind the scenes to give us such a great event!

behind the scenes也可指“实景拍摄场地，摄影棚”。



\2. Not one's scene 不感兴趣/不擅长

这里的scene指“圈子，领域”，比如on the music scene就是“在音乐领域”。所以not one's scene就是“不是某人的领域（不感兴趣或不擅长）”。比如：

-"Do you want to come with me to the concert this Saturday?"

-"No thanks, heavy metal isn't my scene."

 

\3. Arrive on the scene 到达现场/诞生

scene可以指“某个事件发生的现场”，而且一般是不好的事件，arrive on the scene就表示“到达现场”，比如：

By the time I arrived on the scene, Kate and Jen were already arguing.



此外，arrive on the scene还可以表示“诞生，问世”，比如：

①We are overjoyed to announced that our baby daughter arrived on the scene at 11:37 last night.

②Funk music arrived on the scene in the 1960s.

 

\4. Heavy scene 沉重的场面

heavy scene指“情况严重或困难的场面”，比如：

Man, that meeting was really a heavy scene.

电影里面的一些可怕场景也可以说成是heavy scene.



\5. Have a change of scene 换（生活/工作）环境

当你想要搬到另一个城市来换一个生活环境的时候，就可以这么说：

I decided to move across the country for college because I really wanted a change of scene after growing up in this small town.

**I went with them out to the veranda.**

**On the green Sound, stagnant in the heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea.**

> 在绿色的海湾上，海水在酷热中停滞不动，一条小帆船慢慢向比较新鲜的海水移动。

>
> 他正在就如何振兴低迷的经济征求意见。

**Gatsby’s eyes followed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed across the bay.**

**“I’m right across from you.” “So you are.”**

**Our eyes lifted over the rose-beds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse of the dog-days along-shore.**

**Slowly the white wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit of the sky.**

**Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and the abounding blessed isles.**

> ==isle英 [aɪl] 美 [aɪl] n. 岛==

> 再往前是水波荡漾的海洋和星罗棋布的宝岛。

**“There’s sport for you,” said Tom, nodding.**

**“I’d like to be out there with him for about an hour.”**

**We had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened too against the heat, and drank down nervous gayety with the cold ale.**

>
> 我们在餐厅里吃的午饭，里面也遮得很阴凉，大家把紧张的欢笑和凉啤酒一起喝下肚去。

> ①darkened too against the heat “遮得很阴凉”；这里指餐厅的窗户外也安置了遮阳的天篷（我们昨天介绍的awning）;
>
> ②drank down nervous gayety with the cold ale“大家把紧张的欢笑和凉啤酒一起喝下肚去”；drink down指“一饮而尽”（to drink all of something）; nervous gayety也是一组矛盾修辞（Oxymoron）, 这里暗示虽然表面上气氛融洽，但其实大家都各自心怀鬼胎。

**“What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon?” cried Daisy, “and the day after that, and the next thirty years?”**

**“Don’t be morbid,” Jordan said.**

**“Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.”**

> ==morbid==

> adj.（兴趣、精神、思想等）病态的
>
> 原文：“Don’t be morbid,” Jordan said. “Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.”
>
> "不要这样胡思乱想，"乔丹说，"秋天一到，天高气爽，生活就又重新开始了。

> 💧morbid表示“病态的”，尤指“心理上不正常的”，比如：Some people have a morbid fascination with crime.
>
> 一些人对犯罪有一种病态的痴迷。
>
> 💧morbid的名词形式是morbidity. morbidity and mortality就是指“（某一疾病的）发病率和死亡率” 。

**“But it’s so hot,” insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, “and everything’s so confused. Let’s all go to town!”**

**Her voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, molding its senselessness into forms.**

> <font color=red>Her voice struggled on / through the heat, / beating against it, / molding its senselessness into forms.</font>
>
> 她的声音继续在热浪中挣扎，向它冲击着，把没有知觉的热气塑成各种形状。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①struggled on through the heat “继续在热浪中挣扎”；struggle on 表示“继续挣扎”（keep on struggling）, on在这里作副词，表示一种持续性；
>
> ②molding its senselessness into forms “把没有知觉的热气塑成各种形状”；senselessness是指热气（the heat）本身的特质，有两层含义：“没有知觉、意识”（unconsciousness）; “没有意义、目的”（meaningness）;
>
> *这里作者表达得很晦涩，但其实就是在暗指Daisy说的话、她的声音也充斥着“无意义”，比如：“What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon?” cried Daisy, “and the day after that, and the next thirty years?”

**“I’ve heard of making a garage out of a stable,” Tom was saying to Gatsby, “but I’m the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage.”**

**“Who wants to go to town?” demanded Daisy insistently.**

**Gatsby’s eyes floated toward her.**

**“Ah,” she cried, “you look so cool.”**

**Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space.**

**With an effort she glanced down at the table.**

**“You always look so cool,” she repeated.**

**She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw.**

**He was astounded.**

**His mouth opened a little, and he looked at Gatsby, and then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as some one he knew a long time ago.**

**“You resemble the advertisement of the man,” she went on innocently.**

**“You know the advertisement of the man ——”**

**“All right,” broke in Tom quickly, “I’m perfectly willing to go to town. Come on — we’re all going to town.”**

**He got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife. No one moved.**

**“Come on!” His temper cracked a little.**

**“What’s the matter, anyhow? If we’re going to town, let’s start.”**

**His hand, trembling with his effort at self-control, bore to his lips the last of his glass of ale.**

**Daisy’s voice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing gravel drive.**

**“Are we just going to go?” she objected.**

**“Like this? Aren’t we going to let any one smoke a cigarette first?”**

**“Everybody smoked all through lunch.”**

**“Oh, let’s have fun,” she begged him.**

**“It’s too hot to fuss.”**

**He didn’t answer.**

**“Have it your own way,” she said.**

**“Come on, Jordan.”**

**They went up-stairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet.**

> ==shuffle英 ['ʃʌf(ə)l] 美 [ˈʃʌfəl] v. 洗牌；推诿，推卸；拖曳，慢吞吞地走；搅乱==

**A silver curve of the moon hovered already in the western sky.**

**Gatsby started to speak, changed his mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.**

**“Have you got your stables here?” asked Gatsby with an effort.**

**“About a quarter of a mile down the road.” “Oh.” A pause.**

**“I don’t see the idea of going to town,” broke out Tom savagely.**

> ==savagely英 ['sævɪdʒlɪ] 美 [ˈsævɪdʒlɪ] adv. 野蛮地；残忍地==

**“Women get these notions in their heads ——”**

**“Shall we take anything to drink?” called Daisy from an upper window.**

**“I’ll get some whiskey,” answered Tom. He went inside.**

**Gatsby turned to me rigidly: “I can’t say anything in his house, old sport.”**

**“She’s got an indiscreet voice,” I remarked. “It’s full of ——” I hesitated.**

**“Her voice is full of money,” he said suddenly.**

**That was it. I’d never understood before.**

**It was full of money — that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals’song of it. . . . high in a white palace the king’s daughter, the golden girl. . . .**

**Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and carrying light capes over their arms.**

**“Shall we all go in my car?” suggested Gatsby.**

**He felt the hot, green leather of the seat.**

**“I ought to have left it in the shade.”**

**“Is it standard shift?” demanded Tom.**

**“Yes.” “Well, you take my coupe and let me drive your car to town.”**

**The suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby.**

**“I don’t think there’s much gas,” he objected.**

**“Plenty of gas,” said Tom boisterously.**

**He looked at the gauge. “And if it runs out I can stop at a drug-store. You can buy anything at a drug-store nowadays.”**

**A pause followed this apparently pointless remark.**

**Daisy looked at Tom frowning, and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar and vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in words, passed over Gatsby’s face.**

**“Come on, Daisy,” said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby’s car.**

**“I’ll take you in this circus wagon.”**

**He opened the door, but she moved out from the circle of his arm.**

**“You take Nick and Jordan. We’ll follow you in the coupe.”**

**“I’ve made a small investigation of this fellow,” he continued.**

**“I could have gone deeper if I’d known ——”**

**“Do you mean you’ve been to a medium?” inquired Jordan humorously.**

**“What?” Confused, he stared at us as we laughed. “A medium?”**

**“About Gatsby.”**

**“About Gatsby! No, I haven’t. I said I’d been making a small investigation of his past.”**

**“And you found he was an Oxford man,” said Jordan helpfully.**

**“An Oxford man!” He was incredulous.**

**“Like hell he is! He wears a pink suit.”**

**“Nevertheless he’s an Oxford man.”**

**“Oxford, New Mexico,” snorted Tom contemptuously, “or something like that.”**

**“Listen, Tom. If you’re such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?” demanded Jordan crossly.**

**“Daisy invited him; she knew him before we were married — God knows where!”**

**We were all irritable now with the fading ale, and aware of it we drove for a while in silence.**

**Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg’s faded eyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby’s caution about gasoline.**

**“We’ve got enough to get us to town,” said Tom.**

**“But there’s a garage right here,” objected Jordan.**

**“I don’t want to get stalled in this baking heat.”**

**Tom threw on both brakes impatiently, and we slid to an abruptdusty stop under Wilson’s sign.**

**“Been sick all day.”**

**“What’s the matter?” “I’m all run down.”**

**In the sunlight his face was green.**

**“I didn’t mean to interrupt your lunch,” he said.**

**“How do you like this one?” inquired Tom. “I bought it last week.”**

**“It’s a nice yellow one,” said Wilson,as he strained at the handle.**

**“Like to buy it?”**

**“Big chance,” Wilson smiled faintly.**

**“No, but I could make some money on the other.”**

**“What do you want money for, all of a sudden?”**

**“I’ve been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and I want to go West.”**

**“Your wife does,” exclaimed Tom, startled.**

**“She’s been talking about it for ten years.”**

**He rested for a moment against the pump, shading his eyes.**

**“And now she’s going whether she wants to or not. I’m going to get her away.”**

### 背景知识

**💧Connotation of the color pink** 

**粉色暗示了什么？**

“An Oxford man!” He was incredulous. “Like hell he is! He wears a pink suit.”（"牛津大学毕业生！"他完全不相信，"他要是才他妈的怪哩！他穿一套粉红色衣服。"）

为什么Tom仅仅因为Gatsby穿了一套粉红色的衣服就笃定说他不是牛津大学毕业的呢？虽然今天我们对于粉色的偏见往往在于它的性别气质，比如认为粉色代表的是女性气质femininity, 对于穿粉色衣服的男孩会“戏称”为sissy（女孩子气的男孩）。但在20世纪初的美国，粉色常常和一个人的出身阶级（class origin）联系在一起：

 

Pink had working-class connotations.

也就是说，工人阶层才会穿粉色，一个受过高等教育、上层社会的绅士是不会穿粉色的（An educated, upper-class gentleman – an Oxford man – would not wear a pink suit）.

 

但在今天，这个潮流也出现了反转。比如喜欢穿粉色T恤或者在高尔夫球场上穿粉色裤子的，常常是混迹各个乡间俱乐部（country club）的年轻富家子弟们（It’s the preppie type men at the country club who are wearing pink shirts or even, on the golf course, pants）.



**💧Snob 势利鬼**



“Listen, Tom. If you’re such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?” demanded Jordan crossly.

"我说，汤姆，你既然这样”瞧不起人，那么为什么请他吃午饭呢？"乔丹气恼地质问道。

snob指“自命不凡的人，势利鬼”（a person who despises, ignores, or is patronizing to those he or she considers inferior）. 我们熟悉的虚构人物形象属于snob这一类呢？

 

比如，《怪物史莱克》里的白马王子（Prince Charming）:

"I am the rightful King of Far Far Away!"（我才是遥远王国的真正国王！）

"I mean, how charming can I be when I have to pretend that I'm that dreadful orge?"（要我装成那个可怕的怪物，我还怎么展示我的魅力呢！）——Prince Charming把自己变成Shrek接近Fiona, 但说话和行为都完全是自己原本暴躁傲慢的样子，结果当然没能赢得Fiona的爱和信任，于是有了以上的托辞。

### 课文理解

开头的场景依然是在Tom的豪宅里。尽管表面上其乐融融，但暗地里却隐藏着不少紧张激烈的情节，比如Daisy在Tom的面前公然和Gatsby调情——



💧**Clue 1**: Dasiy is being obvious about her affair with 



**Evidence 1**: “You always look so cool,” she repeated. She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw.

"你看上去总是那么帅。"她重复说。她已经告诉他她爱他，汤姆·布坎农也看出来了。

 

比起Gatsby的小心谨慎，Daisy则轻佻得多。比如毫不掩饰自己从以前就认识Gatsby这件事（Daisy用了always）, 以及她对他的爱慕 。

之后大家一起准备出发去纽约市里的时候，Daisy拒绝和Tom同车，而是大摇大摆地走向了Gatsby, 还用手拽着他的上衣（俨然一副小鸟依人的模样）——



**Evidence 2**: He opened the door, but she moved out from the circle of his arm. “You take Nick and Jordan. We’ll follow you in the coupe.” She walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand.

他打开车门，但她从他手臂的圈子里走了出去。"你带尼克和乔丹去。我们开小轿车跟在你后面。" 她走近盖茨比，用手摸着他的上衣。

这可以说是Daisy对Tom出轨在先的挑衅和反击了，但她是否真的有意要和Gatsby再续前缘也还没能下定论。我们再来看一看今天内容里出现的Daisy声音的描述——



💧**Clue 2**: Daisy's voice is materialistic and shallow.



**Evidence 1**: It was full of money — that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals’ song of it. . . . high in a white palace the king’s daughter, the golden girl. . . .

它是充满了金钱——这正是她声音里抑扬起伏的无穷无尽的魅力的源泉，金钱了当的声音，铙钹齐鸣的歌声……高高的在一座白色的宫殿里，国王的女儿，黄金女郎……

 

在前面的几章内容中，Daisy的声音给我们留下的印象是“迷人的”（enchanting）“神秘的”（mysterious）, 总是让人不由自主地朝她靠近。而这里的描述则更直接——“她的声音充满了金钱”，有两层含义：一是指她出身富有；二是指她对物质金钱有着强烈的渴望。

除了物质性，她的声音还透露了她的肤浅——



**Evidence 2**: “What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon?” cried Daisy, “and the day after that, and the next thirty years?”

"我们今天下午做什么好呢？"黛西大声说，"还有明天，还有今后三十年？"

 

读到这里，大家也许想起了Nick第一次到他们家做客的时候，Daisy也有过一番类似的发问：“Do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it.” “All right,” said Daisy. “What’ll we plan?” She turned to me helplessly: “What do people plan?”

这两处的问句都属于“假装疑问”（Aporia）的修辞手法，也就是说话者虽然在提问，但其实并不期待可以得到回答，因为问题本身往往是无解的，比如《哈姆雷特》中的"To be, or not to be: that is the question."就是一个典型的例子。

这些问题反映出了Daisy内心的空洞，另一方面也折射了她所处的上流阶层的生活，在浮华背后其实是空虚和挥霍。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****Some knowledge about beer 啤酒常识**

因为天气炎热，所以故事里的主人公们都喝起了冰啤酒来解暑（We had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened too against the heat, and drank down nervous gayety with the cold ale）.

那么这里的ale指的是什么啤酒呢？我们来看一看啤酒的分类~

 

\1. 啤酒分类

啤酒进化的过程有几千年的时间，弄不清它的风格口味是很正常的。一般可以按照颜色和产地来分，但也可以根据啤酒本身的发酵方式（国外习惯直接在啤酒瓶上标注啤酒的风味，所以了解发酵方式会更在选择种类的时候更便利哦~），最基本的是两种：Ale（爱尔）和Lager（拉格）。两者的差别只在于发酵的温度和酵母工作的位置（Ale是上发酵，Lager是下发酵）↓

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/34fdf803968f30ef087214293ee8e67f-sz_15257.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



直观来说，就是喝Ale啤酒的时候先喝到酵母和辅料的味道，之后要在这些味道里面找麦芽的香味，而Lager啤酒先喝到的是麦芽的香味，然后才有其它辅料的味道。 

 

其他各种风味都是从两种发酵方式演变而来的，比如黑啤（Stout）就属于Ale的一种。黑啤的出现是因为1698年彼得大帝在它的欧洲之旅时爱上了 英国波特黑啤酒，并要求英国酒商为俄罗斯圣彼得堡的宫廷酿造波特啤酒。但是，由于途经两百多公里寒冷的波罗的海，啤酒面临冻结、变坏等问题，变得不可饮用。英国酒商随之进行改良，增强了该酒的酒精浓度和啤酒花投放量（所以酒精度数比较高并且苦味很重），以抵御严寒的天气并更好保存啤酒。

 

最有名的一款黑啤是由英国约克郡森美尔（Samuel Smith）啤酒厂生产的帝国世涛（Imperial Stout）.

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/4196937d53cb6b679945067f19004c54-sz_39710.jpeg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



在《王牌特工》里出现的健力士（Guinness）也是黑啤。

而国内产的青岛、燕京都属于Lager（所以品牌商会非常强调“麦芽”，因为Lager先喝到的是麦芽香）。

 

\2. 啤酒选择

一般在选择啤酒的时候很容易产生以下误解：

①啤酒的颜色越深酒精度越高？

深色的啤酒往往给人带来酒精度更高、口味更重的感觉。在绝大数情况下啤酒的颜色取决于麦芽，而决定酒精度高低的是麦汁中的含糖量，而不是麦芽的颜色。同时也跟酿制工艺有关。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/0c9fe01e0fcab1c3aee0fc1874661c77-sz_21110.jpeg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



②啤酒泡沫越多越好？

啤酒质量好坏不能以泡沫的多少来定。优质啤酒的泡沫应细腻、洁白，且挂杯持久，酒液饮完之后仍有大量泡沫在杯壁之上，才是真正的好啤酒。同时泡沫的多少还取决于啤酒的风格和当时的饮用温度。

 

③啤酒还有生的？熟的？

熟啤（Pasteurimd）指的是经过了巴氏消毒灭菌的啤酒。但高温杀菌使其牺牲了一定的口感，并不是最好喝的啤酒。真正好喝的是生啤，也叫鲜啤（Draught）, 它保留了啤酒原有的风味和活性酵母菌，口感更胜一筹。但这种啤酒保质期不长只有3—5天，而且必须低温保存。

并且在生啤里最好喝的是——“扎啤”（Draft）. draft是指“经过净化、汲取的”，这样命名是因为扎啤从酿造工艺来讲，本质就是酿制成熟的，未经热处理的。因此也保持了良好的口味和营养。

对于喜欢清淡口味的小伙伴来说，light beer也会是不错的选择哦~

**The coupe flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a waving hand.**

**“What do I owe you?” demanded Tom harshly.**

**“I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,” remarked Wilson.**

**“That’s why I want to get away. That’s why I been bothering you about the car.”**

**“What do I owe you?”**

**“Dollar twenty.”**

> *上文Mr. Wilson提到自己得知了一个真相（也就是他的妻子Myrtle有了外遇），所以才急着找Tom把那辆二手车卖给他，接着就带自己的妻子离开：“I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,” remarked Wilson. “That’s why I want to get away. That’s why I been bothering you about the car.”（wise up “知道，了解糟糕的真相”；funny “不老实的，错误的”）；但他并没有意识到Myrtle出轨的对象是Tom.

**He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world, and the shock had made him physically sick.**

**I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour before — and it occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well.**

**Wilson was so sick that he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty — as if he had just got some poor girl with child.**

> <font color=red>I stared at him / and then at Tom, / who had made a parallel discovery / less than an hour before / — and it occurred to me / that there was no difference between men, / in intelligence or race, / so profound / as the difference / between the sick and the well.</font>

>
> *其次也是在讽刺Tom, 他虽然在学识教养和血统地位上都胜过Mr. Wilson, 但在遇到妻子出轨这样的事情上，他和Mr. Wilson的那种失神慌张的反应都是一样的（There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. ），仅凭这一点就足以抹杀他在其他方面的所有优越感。

**“I’ll let you have that car,” said Tom.**

**“I’ll send it over to-morrow afternoon.”**

**That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of something behind.**

**Over the ash heaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil, but I perceived, after a moment, that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away.**

**In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a little, and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car.**

**So engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed, and one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture.**

> <font color=red>So engrossed was she / that she had no consciousness / of being observed, / and one emotion after another / crept into her face / like objects into a slowly developing picture.</font>

**Her expression was curiously familiar —**

**it was an expression I had often seen on women’s faces, but on Myrtle Wilson’s face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on Jordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife.**

**There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic.**

**“You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it.”**

**He unrolled the bottle of whiskey from the towel and put it on the table.**

**“Why not let her alone, old sport?” remarked Gatsby.**

**“You’re the one that wanted to come to town.”**

**There was a moment of silence.**

**The telephone book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered, “Excuse me.”— but this time no one laughed.**

**“I’ll pick it up,” I offered.**

**“I’ve got it.” Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered “Hum!” in an interested way, and tossed the book on a chair.**

**“That’s a great expression of yours, isn’t it?” said Tom sharply.**

**“What is?” “All this ‘old sport’ business. Where’d you pick that up?”**

**“Now see here, Tom,” said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, “if you’re going to make personal remarks I won’t stay here a minute. Call up and order some ice for the mint julep.”**

**As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn’s Wedding March from the ballroom below.**

**“Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!” cried Jordan dismally.**

> ==dismally英 ['dɪzməlɪ] 美 ['dɪzməlɪ] adv. 沉闷地；阴暗地==

**“Still — I was married in the middle of June,” Daisy remembered, “Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?”**

**“Biloxi,” he answered shortly.**

**“A man named Biloxi. ‘blocks’ Biloxi,and he made boxes — that’s a fact — and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.”**

**And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy told him he had to get out.**

**The day after he left Daddy died.”**

**After a moment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent, “There wasn’t any connection.”**

**“I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,” I remarked.**

**“That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he left. He gave me an aluminum putter that I use to-day.”**

**The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of “Yea-ea-ea!” and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began.**

**“We’re getting old,” said Daisy.**

**“If we were young we’d rise and dance.”**

**“Remember Biloxi,” Jordan warned her.**

**“Where’d you know him, Tom?”**

**“Biloxi?” He concentrated with an effort.**

**“I didn’t know him. He was a friend of Daisy’s.”**

**“He was not,” she denied.**

**“I’d never seen him before. He came down in the private car.”**

**“Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville. Asa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room for him.”**

**Jordan smiled.**

**“He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of your class at Yale.”**

**Tom and I looked at each other blankly. “Biloxi?”**

**“First place, we didn’t have any president ——”**

**Gatsby’s foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.**

**“By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you’re an Oxford man.”**

**“Not exactly.”**

**“Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.”**

**“Yes — I went there.” A pause.**

**Then Tom’s voice, incredulous and insulting: “You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven.” Another pause.**

**A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but, the silence was unbroken by his “thank you” and the soft closing of the door.**

**This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.**

**“I told you I went there,” said Gatsby.**

**“I heard you, but I’d like to know when.”**

**“It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That’s why I can’t really call myself an Oxford man.”**

**Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief.**

**But we were all looking at Gatsby.**

**“It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the Armistice,” he continued.**

**“We could go to any of the universities in England or France.”**

**I wanted to get up and slap him on the back.**

**I had one of those renewals of complete faith in him that I’d experienced before.**

### 背景知识

**💧Armistice of 11 November 1918 一战停战协定**

“It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the Armistice,” he continued. “We could go to any of the universities in England or France.”（"那是停战以后他们为一些军官提供的机会，"他继续说下去，"我们可以上任何英国或者法国的大学。"）

整整100年前——1918年11月11日上午11时，在法国贡比涅（Compiègne）的一节火车车厢内，协约国（Allied Powers）与德国签署停火协定，协定标志着历时四年的第一次世界大战的结束。

这是一场导致4000万多人伤亡的人类历史上最残酷的战争之一。停战协定公布后，人们涌上街头欢呼。

美国虽然在战争最初两年正式保持中立，但为协约国提供了重要的援助、资金和物资。美国于1917年正式加入协约国参战。

这里Gatsby的叙述如果属实，我们还可以根据这个时间点，推断出一些隐藏的剧情:

1918年11月一战结束，Gatsby被送往Oxford University呆了5个月；

1919年6月Tom和Daisy结婚 （“Still — I was married in the middle of June,” Daisy remembered.）

*具体的年份推算大家可以自己在书本内容里找一找线索哦~

所以Daisy在婚礼前夕收到Gatsby的来信内容应该是Gatsby很快就会回国了，所以才令Daisy痛苦无比。

### 课文理解

今天的内容里，紧张继续升级。作者在情节安排也设置了不少巧合和隐喻，比如Mr. Wilson也发现了自己太太的不忠，同样的情形在不到一小时之前就发生在了Tom的身上（I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour before）. 但对于Tom来说，则变成了两个致命打击，他已经处于极大的不安和混乱中——



💧**Clue 1**: Tom is in great disquite and disturbance.



**Evidence 1**: There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic.

一个简单的头脑陷入慌乱时是非同小可的，等到我们车子开走的时候，汤姆感到惊慌失措，心里就像正遭受恐惧鞭打一样。



这里a simple mind不仅指Tom的“思想单纯”（比如缺乏谨慎和周全），还暗示了他“只一门心思地想要获得对周围人事物的掌控权”，可以说是一种近乎不理智的偏执。所以他发现自己的情妇和妻子都在脱离自己控制的时候，便感觉惊慌无比。



**Evidence 2**: Several times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight. I think he was afraid they would dart down a side street and out of his life forever.

有好几次他掉过头去向后看，找他们的车子，如果路上的交通把他们耽误了，他就放慢速度，直到他们重新出现。我想他生怕他们会钻进一条小街，从此永远从他生活里消失。



Mr. Wilson决心带Myrtle离开，而且可能已经把她禁足了（在Tom和Nick以及Jordan逗留修车行的时候，Myrtle只是透过窗户看着他们：In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a little, and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car.）所以Tom已经失去了一个筹码，如果再失去Daisy, 他将承受无法想象的流言蜚语带来的羞辱感。



作者还安插了两个隐喻，同时也是两个凶兆（sinister omens）,  指向接下来即将发生的冲突和悲剧——



💧**Clue 2**: The sinister omens — eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg and words by Jordan.



**Evidence 1**: ...and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of something behind. Over the ashheaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil...

因此现在我掉过头去，仿佛有人要我提防背后有什么东西。在灰堆上方，T·J·埃克尔堡大夫的巨眼在守望着……



Eckleburg大夫之眼可以看作上帝之眼的象征——监视、审判一切。kept their vigil就是指“守夜”（尤指为了祈祷、守护病人或是提防危险情况）。这里隐晦地暗示了有不详的事情要发生。



**Evidence 2**: “I love New York on summer afternoons when every one’s away. There’s something very sensuous about it — overripe, as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands.”

"我爱夏天午后的纽约，人都跑光了。它是那么的令人快活——一种熟透的滋味，仿佛各种奇异的果实都纷纷落到你手里。"



sensuous本义指“性感的，肉感的”，强调给人以“感官上的愉悦”（pleasing to people's senses）. 这里强调了纽约的娱乐活动都是物质或肉欲上的，暗示了道德上的败落。而overripe指“过熟的，熟到快要烂的”，同样也暗示了故事发展已经进入高潮，所有的矛盾冲突都到了爆发的时间点。



另外，“果实落入手中”（frujts falling into hands）这个意象也和圣经中亚当夏娃偷食禁果的故事有一定联系。这一行为在宗教上的象征意义是“人类的堕落”（fall from grace）, 直译是“从上帝的恩典中堕落”，以及“失去纯真”（loss of innocence）. 这里暗指接下来故事中的人物们将会作出一些违背道德甚至人性的事情。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧关于《婚礼进行曲》你不知道的事**



As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn’s Wedding March from the ballroom below.（汤姆一拿起话筒，那憋得紧紧的热气突然爆发出声音，这时我们听到门德尔松的《婚礼进行曲》惊心动魄的和弦从底下舞厅里传上来。）



屋子里火药味正浓的时候，楼底下传来了门德尔松的《婚礼进行曲》，本来欢快激情的音乐变成了让人感觉不详的预兆（portentous指“预示凶兆的”）。《婚礼进行曲》尽管已经成为了一个老掉牙的传统，但其实背后深有讲究，今天的彩蛋我们就来看一看它里面的典故和秘密~



\1. 婚礼进行曲有两首

首先，婚礼进行曲有两首，并且演奏的场合及目的都不同：

一首是上文提到的由门德尔松（Mendelssohn）创作的，氛围偏向于欢快欣喜，一般在新人牵手走出礼堂时演奏；特点是以响亮的小号声开始，随后进入到一段庄严的列队进行音乐，接下来是较轻松活泼的进行曲，重复两次后与木管乐器的优雅声混为一片，逐渐淡去。

另一首则是由瓦格纳（Wagner）创作的，速度徐缓，氛围偏向于庄严肃穆，是新娘入场时要演奏的（for the entry of the bride）. 而且有一个明显的特点就是开始和和结尾都有几声钟响，似乎在宣告婚姻的来临。



\2. 婚礼进行曲的由来

瓦格纳所作的《婚礼进行曲》，原是三幕传奇歌剧《罗恩格林》里在贵妇们引导新人入新房的混声合唱，后被改编成管弦乐而成为了今天的曲子。

这首进行曲比较庄重肃穆也跟故事情节有关：人神相爱，但作为人类的新娘必须要严格遵守不询问新郎姓名和来历的誓言，俩人才能结婚；但是后来有坏人从中作梗，引诱新娘破坏了誓言，最后俩人没能顺利结婚并且从此无法见面。



而门德尔松所作的《婚礼进行曲》，是为莎士比亚著名的喜剧作品《仲夏夜之梦》第五幕所作的前奏曲配乐。

这个故事本身充满了浪漫和梦幻：互相爱慕的男女主人公被女主的父亲反对，女主的父亲给她安排的未婚夫却是女主好友的爱慕对象。后来四个人一起逃入森林，又因为仙王乱施魔汁而导致四人之间情感错乱。但最终仙子还是把错误修正并且促成了两对恋人。

也正是有了甜蜜逗乐的故事，门德尔松的进行曲才更美妙活泼得多~

**Daisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.**

**“Open the whiskey, Tom,” she ordered, “and I’ll make you a mint julep. Then you won’t seem so stupid to yourself. . . . Look at the mint!”**

**“Wait a minute,” snapped Tom, “I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question.”**

**“Go on,” Gatsby said politely.**

**“What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?”**

**They were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.**

**“He isn’t causing a row.”**

**Daisy looked desperately from one to the other.**

**“You’re causing a row. Please have a little self-control.”**

**“Self-control!” Repeated Tom incredulously.**

**“I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife.**

**Well, if that’s the idea you can count me out. . . .**

**Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next they’ll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white.”**

**“We’re all white here,” murmured Jordan.**

**“I know I’m not very popular. I don’t give big parties.**

**I suppose you’ve got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any friends — in the modern world.”**

**Angry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he opened his mouth.**

**The transition from libertine to prig was so complete.**

**“I’ve got something to tell you, old sport ——” began Gatsby.**

**But Daisy guessed at his intention.**

**“Please don’t!” she interrupted helplessly.**

**“Please let’s all go home. Why don’t we all go home?”**

**“That’s a good idea.” I got up.**

**“Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink.”**

**“I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.”**

**“Your wife doesn’t love you,” said Gatsby. “She’s never loved you. She loves me.”**

**“You must be crazy!” exclaimed Tom automatically.**

**Gatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.**

**“She never loved you, do you hear?” he cried.**

**“She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved any one except me!”**

**At this point Jordan and I tried to go, but Tom and Gatsby insisted with competitive firmness that we remain — as though neither of them had anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emotions.**

**“Sit down, Daisy,” Tom’s voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal note.**

**“What’s been going on? I want to hear all about it.”**

**“I told you what’s been going on,” said Gatsby.**

**“Going on for five years — and you didn’t know.”**

**Tom turned to Daisy sharply.**

**“You’ve been seeing this fellow for five years?”**

**“Not seeing,” said Gatsby.**

**“No, we couldn’t meet. But both of us loved each other all that time, old sport, and you didn’t know. I used to laugh sometimes.”— but there was no laughter in his eyes ——” to think that you didn’t know.”**

**“Oh — that’s all.”**

**Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman and leaned back in his chair.**

> ==clergyman英 ['klɜːdʒɪmən] 美 [ˈklɜ:rdʒimən] n. 牧师；教士==

**“You’re crazy!” he exploded.**

**“I can’t speak about what happened five years ago, because I didn’t know Daisy then — and I’ll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door.**

**But all the rest of that’s a God damned lie.**

**Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now.”**

**“No,” said Gatsby, shaking his head.**

**“She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas in her head and doesn’t know what she’s doing.”**

**He nodded sagely.**

**“And what’s more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time.”**

**“You’re revolting,” said Daisy.**

> ==revolting adj. 极难闻的,使人厌恶的,令人恶心的==

**She turned to me, and her voice, dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: “Do you know why we left Chicago?**

**I’m surprised that they didn’t treat you to the story of that little spree.”**

**Gatsby walked over and stood beside her.**

**“Daisy, that’s all over now,” he said earnestly.**

**“It doesn’t matter any more. Just tell him the truth — that you never loved him — and it’s all wiped out forever.”**

**She looked at him blindly.**

**“Why — how could I love him — possibly?”**

**“You never loved him.” She hesitated.**

**Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal, as though she realized at last what she was doing — and as though she had never, all along, intended doing anything at all.**

**But it was done now. It was too late.**

**“I never loved him,” she said, with perceptible reluctance.**

**“Not at Kapiolani?” demanded Tom suddenly.**

**“No.”**

**There was a husky tenderness in his tone.. .. “Daisy?”**

**“Please don’t.” Her voice was cold, but the rancor was gone from it.**

> ==rancor英 ['ræŋkə] 美 [ˈræŋkɚ] n. 深仇；怨恨；敌意==

**She looked at Gatsby.**

**“There, Jay,” she said — but her hand as she tried to light a cigarettewas trembling.**

**Suddenly she threw the cigarette and the burning match on the carpet.**

**“Oh, you want too much!” she cried to Gatsby.**

**“I love you now — isn’t that enough? I can’t help what’s past.”**

**She began to sob helplessly.**

**“I did love him once — but I loved you too.”**

**Gatsby’s eyes opened and closed.**

**“You loved me too?” he repeated.**

**“Even that’s a lie,” said Tom savagely.**

**“She didn’t know you were alive. Why — there’re things between Daisy and me that you’ll never know, things that neither of us can ever forget.”**

**The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.**

**“I want to speak to Daisy alone,” he insisted. “She’s all excited now ——”**

**“Even alone I can’t say I never loved Tom,” she admitted in a pitiful voice.**

**“It wouldn’t be true.”**

**“Of course it wouldn’t,” agreed Tom.**

**She turned to her husband.**

**“As if it mattered to you,” she said.**

**“Of course it matters. I’m going to take better care of you from now on.”**

**“You don’t understand,” said Gatsby, with a touch of panic.**

**“You’re not going to take care of her any more.”**

**“I’m not?” Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed.**

**He could afford to control himself now.**

**“Why’s that?”**

**“Daisy’s leaving you.” “Nonsense.”**

**“I am, though,” she said with a visible effort.**

**“She’s not leaving me!” Tom’s words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby.**

**“Certainly not for a common swindler who’d have to steal the ring he put on her finger.”**

**“I won’t stand this!” cried Daisy. “Oh, please let’s get out.”**

**“Who are you, anyhow?” broke out Tom.**

**“You’re one of that bunch that hangs around with Meyer Wolfsheim— that much I happen to know. I’ve made a little investigation into your affairs — and I’ll carry it further to-morrow.”**

**“You can suit yourself about that, old sport,” said Gatsby steadily.**

**“I found out what your ‘drug-stores’ were.”**

**He turned to us and spoke rapidly.**

**“He and this Wolfsheim bought up a lot of side-street drug-stores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter.**

**That’s one of his little stunts.**

> ==stunt英 [stʌnt] 美 [stʌnt] n. 噱头，手腕；绝技==

**I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw him, and I wasn’t far wrong.”**

**“What about it?” said Gatsby politely.**

**“I guess your friend Walter Chase wasn’t too proud to come in on it.”**

**“And you left him in the lurch, didn’t you? You let him go to jail for a month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the subject of you.”**

**“He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old sport.”**

**“Don’t you call me ‘old sport’!” cried Tom.**

**Gatsby said nothing.**

**“Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but Wolfsheim scared him into shutting his mouth.”**

**That unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby’s face.**

**“That drug-store business was just small change,” continued Tom slowly, “but you’ve got something on now that Walter’s afraid to tell me about.”**

**I glanced at Daisy, who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her husband, and at Jordan, who had begun to balance an invisible but absorbing object on the tip of her chin.**

**Then I turned back to Gatsby — and was startled at his expression.**

**He looked — and this is said in all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden — as if he had “killed a man.”**

> <font color=red>He looked — / and this is said / in all contempt/ for the babbled slander / of his garden — / as if he had “killed a man.”</font>

**For a moment the set of his face could be described in just that fantastic way.**

**It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything, defending his name against accusations that had not been made.**

**But with every word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave that up,**

**and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room.**

**“please, Tom! I can’t stand this any more.”**

**Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage, she had had, were definitely gone.**

**“You two start on home, Daisy,” said Tom. “In Mr. Gatsby’s car.”**

### 背景知识

**💧1. Mint julep 薄荷茱莉普**

“Open the whiskey, Tom,” she ordered, “and I’ll make you a mint julep. Then you won’t seem so stupid to yourself. . . . Look at the mint!”（"打开威士忌，汤姆，"她命令道，"我给你做一杯薄荷酒。然后你就个会觉得自己那么蠢了……你看这些薄荷叶子！"）

薄荷茱莉普（Mint julep）是鸡尾酒（cocktail）的一种，喝完后可以消除口中的苦味。这种酒一般由四种成分混合而成：薄荷叶（mint leaf）, 波旁威士忌（bourbon）, 单糖浆（simple syrup）, 碎冰（crushed ice）.

同时为了保持冰爽的口感，一般用银杯或锡杯盛装（often served in silver or pewter cups）; 而且端起来的时候只接触上端或底部的边缘（held only by the bottom and top edges of the cup）, 这样就可以保证杯子外面附上一层白霜啦~ 而现在，对杯子则没有那么挑剔，装在highball杯、collins杯和old-fashioned杯中，并插上吸管的Mint Julep已经很普遍了。

薄荷茱莉普诞生于美国南方，时间大约是18世纪。julep从西班牙语julepe变形而来（语源是阿拉伯语），原义指sweet drink, 因为味道甘甜而用于辅助服药（a vehicle for medicine）. 

**💧2. Libertine 浪荡子**

The transition from libertine to prig was so complete.（一个酒徒色鬼竟然摇身一变就成了道学先生。）

libertine指“浪荡子，好色之徒”（one devoid of most moral principles, a sense of responsibility, or sexual restraints）. Libertinism也被看作是Hedonism（享乐主义）的一种极端。

libertine在14世纪从拉丁语（libertus）进入英语中，本义是指“被解放的奴隶”（freedman, a slave who had been set free）. 到16世纪，libertine指代的还包括宗教或世俗上的自由思想家（religious and secular freethinkers）, 这类人拒绝传统信仰，遵守自己的一套原则。直到17世纪，这个词才开始指“道德上放荡不羁之人”（unstrained in moral situations）.

历史上有一个著名的浪荡子人物—— 十七世纪诗人约翰·威尔姆（John Wilmot）, 人称罗彻斯特伯爵二世（2nd Earl of Rochester），以放荡堕落英年早逝闻名，死后他的作品才受到各界注意与褒扬。他的一生短促而狂野，作为当时世人眼中诡计多端且天赋异秉的无耻之徒，他不仅成为英国历史中不可或缺的好事者、才华横溢的天才，还是对自由最坚信不移的浪荡子。

法国的一位导演根据以他的故事为原型的小说改编了一部电影，名字就叫*The Libertine*.

这里Nick讽刺Tom原本是一个浪荡之徒，结果摇身变成一副道貌岸然的样子。

### 课文理解

在今天的内容里，故事中的三角矛盾终于到了爆发的一刻。首先是Tom揭露了Gatsby所从事的非法生意——买通药房后售卖私酒。但这里除了印证前文对Gatsby的猜测，Tom还无意透露了一个细节，也就是他的朋友也曾经跟Gatsby合伙。可见名贵之流并不如Tom所自恃的那样道德正义——



💧**Clue 1**: People from upper class also participate in illegal business.



**Evidence 1**: “He and this Wolfsheim bought up a lot of side-street drug-stores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter. ”

"他和这个姓沃尔夫山姆的家伙在本地和芝加哥买下了许多小街上的药房，私自把酒精卖给人家喝。"



**Evidence 2**: “And you left him in the lurch, didn’t you? You let him go to jail for a month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the subject of you.”

"你们还把他坑了，是不是？你们让他在新泽西州坐了一个月监牢。天啊！你应当听听瓦尔特议论你的那些话。"



Walter就是Tom的一位朋友，和Gatsby合伙后挣了不少钱，结果不幸被捕入狱。后来他还打算向警方举报Gatsby和Wolfsheim, 但是在受到Wolfsheim的恐吓后没有招供。（“Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but Wolfsheim scared him into shutting his mouth.”）

听到这里，Daisy不仅是惊诧，恐怕已经吓得花容失色了（I glanced at Daisy, who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her husband, and at Jordan…）她的高贵自尊绝不会容忍自己的情人从事的竟然是违法的生意。

但这只是她拒绝Gatsby的原因之一，根本的问题在于，她自始至终都没有想过和Gatsby复合——



💧**Clue 2**: Daisy's sole intention is to get back at Tom.



**Evidence 1**: “Oh, you want too much!” she cried to Gatsby. “I love you now — isn’t that enough? I can’t help what’s past.” She began to sob helplessly. “I did love him once — but I loved you too.”

"啊，你的要求太过分了！"她对盖茨比喊道，"我现在爱你——难道这还不够吗？过去的事我没法挽回。"她无可奈何地抽抽噎噎哭了起来。"我曾经爱过他——但那时候我也爱着你。"



**Evidence 2**: “Daisy’s leaving you.” “Nonsense.” “I am, though,” she said with a visible effort.

"黛西要离开你了。" "胡说八道。" "不过我确实要离开你。"她显然很费劲地说。



这两段对话发生在Tom抖露Gatsby从事非法生意之前。Daisy无法否认自己完全不爱Tom, 所以可以明确的是，Gatsby对Daisy来说，更多时候只是一颗棋子，一颗她用来“操纵”Tom，并且挽回自己的婚姻和家庭地位的棋子。

最后Tom勒令Daisy坐上Gatsby的车回家，然后两人黯然离开。（They were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental, isolated, like ghosts, even from our pity.）

### 今日彩蛋

**💧Heartbroken scenes in literature** 



原文出现了一幕很心碎的场景：Gatsby质问Daisy “You loved me too?” 结果Tom立马插嘴说 “Why — there’re things between Daisy and me that you’ll never know, things that neither of us can ever forget.”

Tom的话刺痛了Gatsby的心，并且原文用了一个很直观但形象的表达：The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.

今天的彩蛋我们就来看一看在英文名著里有哪些描述心碎的片段~



\1. Anne of Green Gables, L.M. Montgomery

《绿山墙的安妮》 露西·莫德·蒙哥马利



There is no use in loving things if you have to be torn from them. Is there? And it's so hard to keep from loving things, isn't it?

因为爱一个人而受到伤害有什么意义呢？但不去爱又真的很难，不是吗？



这一段也和王尔德的一句名言有异曲同工之妙：

The heart was made to be broken.

Remedy: It’s tempting to try and protect your heart to keep it from ever breaking. But! A heart that's never used is also broken.

人会出于本能地保护自己的心免受破碎之苦。但是，如果你连尝试爱的勇气都没有，那么你也会感受到心碎之苦。



\2. The Little Mermaid, Hans Christian Andersen

《海的女儿》 汉斯·克里斯蒂安·安徒生



Never had she danced so beautifully; the sharp knives cut her feet, but she did not feel it, for the pain in her heart was far greater.

她从没有跳得那么美；锋利的刀伤到了她的脚，但是她没有感觉到，因为她的心远比伤口痛。



Remedy: Because to live is to be hurt, although that shouldn't ever stop you from doing all that awful, wonderful, bittersweet living.

虽然活着就会受伤，但你依然要经历这同时糟糕、美好、苦乐参半的生活。



\3. Heartburn, Nora Ephron

《心痛》 诺拉·伊佛朗



And then the dreams break into a million tiny pieces. The dream dies, which leaves you with achoice: you can settle for reality, or you can go off, like a fool, and dream another dream.

然后美梦变得支离破碎，碎成几百万个小碎片。梦碎了，你也必须选择，是因为现实而安定下来，还是像个傻瓜一样、去追寻另一个梦。



Remedy: Things end. They do. They die and they fade and they wither or they just went away when you weren't paying attention. The foolish thing to do is go after a new beginning. So go out and be a fool. It's so worth it.

所有事都有终结。你没留意的时候，它们死亡、淡出记忆、枯萎或离去。重新开始或许看起来很傻，但这值得。所以别担心：就去做个傻瓜吧，因为它值得。



\4. My Mortal Enemy, Willa Cather

《不共戴天的仇敌》 薇拉·凯瑟



People can be lovers and enemies at the same time, you know.

你知道吗，人可以同时是情人和敌人。



Remedy: You are all too aware that you can adore someone with your whole stupid heart, and yet hate them with your whole entire mind. Someone can be right AND wrong for you.

你很清楚，自己可以用那愚蠢的心去溺爱一个人；但是恨他们的时候，用的却是你的整个大脑。有的人对你来说，既对又错。



\5. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Betty Smith

《布鲁克林有棵树》 贝蒂·史密斯



Oh, you'll be happy, again, never fear. But you won't forget. Every time you fall in love it will be because something in the man reminds you of him.

哦，别担心，你会再次快乐起来的，但是你不会忘记这段感情。每当你爱上新的人，都只是因为这人身上有他的影子。



Remedy: The people you love, the people you'vespend time with and energy on, leave an imprint on you. The silver lining? It's often up to us whether that means we're worse off or changed for the better.

你爱的人，为之花时间精力的人，都在你的心里留下深深的印记。乌云背后也会有幸福线，很多时候失恋后是好是坏，取决于我们自己。

**So we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight.**

**The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the ash heaps was the principal witness at the inquest.**

**He had slept through the heat until after five, when he strolled over to the garage, and found George Wilson sick in his office — really sick, pale as his own pale hair and shaking all over.**

**Michaelis advised him to go to bed, but Wilson refused, saying that he’d miss a lot of business if he did.**

**While his neighbor was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke out overhead.**

**“I’ve got my wife locked in up there,” explained Wilson calmly.**

**“She’s going to stay there till the day after to-morrow, and then we’re going to move away.”**

**Michaelis was astonished; they had been neighbors for four years, and Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement.**

> *such a statement指上文Mr. Wilson说：“I’ve got my wife locked in up there,” explained Wilson calmly. “She’s going to stay there till the day after to-morrow, and then we’re going to move away.” 因为他从来都是一副受太太支使的样子（He was his wife’s man and not his own.）所以邻居对他竟然把太太关在屋子里感到吃惊。

**Generally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn’t working, he sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed along the road.**

**When any one spoke to him he invariably laughed in an agreeable, colorless way.**

**He was his wife’s man and not his own.**

**So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson wouldn’t say a word — instead he began to throw curious, suspicious glances at his visitor and ask him what he’d been doing at certain times on certain days.**

**Just as the latter was getting uneasy, some workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant, and Michaelis took the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later.**

**But he didn’t.**

**He supposed he forgot to, that’s all.**

**When he came outside again, a little after seven, he was reminded of the conversation because he heard Mrs. Wilson’s voice, loud and scolding, down-stairs in the garage.**

**“Beat me!” he heard her cry.**

**“Throw me down and beat me, you dirty little coward!”**

**A moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and shouting — before he could move from his door the business was over.**

**The “death car,” as the newspapers called it, didn’t stop; it came out of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment, and then disappeared around the next bend.**

**Michaelis wasn’t even sure of its color — he told the first policeman that it was light green.**

**The other car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards beyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark blood with the dust.**

**Michaelis and this man reached her first, but when they had torn open her shirtwaist, still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap, and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath.**

**The mouth was wide open and ripped at the corners, as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long.**

**We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still some distance away.**

**“Wreck!” said Tom.**

**“That’s good. Wilson’ll have a little business at last.”**

**He slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping, until, as we came nearer, the hushed, intent faces of the people at the garage door made him automatically put on the brakes.**

**“We’ll take a look,” he said doubtfully, “just a look.”**

**I became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly from the garage,**

**a sound which as we got out of the coupe and walked toward the door resolved itself into the words “Oh, my God!” uttered over and over in a gasping moan.**

**“There’s some bad trouble here,” said Tom excitedly.**

**He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the garage, which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging wire basket overhead.**

**Then he made a harsh sound in his throat, and with a violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through.**

**The circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it was a minute before I could see anything at all.**

**“Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! oh, Ga-od! oh, my Ga-od!”**

**“No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster’n forty. Going fifty, sixty.”**

**“Come here and let’s have your name. Look out now. I want to get his name.”**

**Some words of this conversation must have reached Wilson, swaying in the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his gasping cries:**

**“You don’t have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of car it was!”**

**Watching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten under his coat.**

**He walked quickly over to Wilson and, standing in front of him, seized him firmly by the upper arms.**

**“You’ve got to pull yourself together,” he said with soothing gruffness.**

**Wilson’s eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.**

### 背景知识

**💧Coffee joint 廉价咖啡馆**

The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the ash heaps was the principal witness at the inquest.（那个年轻的希腊人米切里斯，在灰堆旁边开小咖啡馆的，是验尸时主要的见证人。）

joint指“廉价酒吧（俱乐部，餐厅）”（a cheap bar, club, or restaurant）.



和joint不同的是clip joint, 也称作fleshpot, 专门指“（索价昂贵，敲竹杠）的夜总会”（a night club where customers are tricked into paying excessive amounts of money）.

 

这些地方往往服务质量和态度恶劣（with surprisingly low-grade goods or services）, 在酒里掺水（watering-down alcoholic drinks）或是驱逐不愿意多花钱的顾客轰出门（throwing out customers when they become unwilling or unable to spend more money）都是常有的事。

而他们能够如此嚣张跋扈，也是因为顾客们本身来这些地方消费就属于违法行为，所以只能忍气吞声而不敢向警方举报（since its victims cannot report the venue without admitting that they broke the law）.

在1920到1933年美国举国上下实行禁酒令的期间，这类夜总会遍地都是。后来纽约州酒类管理局出台了对非法售卖酒品以及欺诈消费者的夜总会的惩罚措施（The New York State Liquor Authority has imposed penalties against any licensed premises permitting such conduct）.

今天英国伦敦的Soho区依然聚集了大量的clip joints（也叫作near beer bars），一般开在合法的脱衣舞吧旁边（alongside legitimate strip bars）. 但是自从2007年这一片被划为红灯区后，便受到法律的严格监管，必须执照经营（licences are required）.

### 课文理解

Myrtle和丈夫发生激烈的争吵后冲出屋子跑到了马路上，结果被飞驰而来的汽车撞倒在地，当场毙命。随后向西卵返程的Tom一行人正好遇上这个惨剧，此时Mr. Wilson已经精神崩溃无法自控。在今天的内容里有两个值得关注的点，首先是Mr. Wilson为什么始终没有发现Myrtle的出轨对象是Tom, 以及所谓的肇事车辆the "death car"对本书的主题有什么暗示意义。



💧**Clue 1**: Why does Mr. Wilson fail to notice Myrtle and Tom's affair?



最直接的原因是Mr. Wilson一直专注于和Tom的交易，以至于从来没有猜想他的另一个身份——Myrtle的秘密情人。另一个原因是，Mr. Wilson长年生活在灰谷，和Tom所处的上流社会圈完全隔绝（no access to Tom's social circles），所以即便Tom平日里带着Myrtle四处招摇，Mr. Wilson对此也毫无察觉。

 

文中还有一个细节，当邻居想了解他为什么会把自己的太太关起来的时候，他本能的反应是把这位邻居当成出轨的嫌疑对象——



**Evidence 1**:  So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson wouldn’t say a word — instead he began to throw curious, suspicious glances at his visitor and ask him what he’d been doing at certain times on certain days.

因此，米切里斯很自然地想了解发生了什么事，但威尔逊一个字也不肯说——相反地，他却用古怪的、怀疑的目光端详起这位客人来，并且盘问他某些日子某些时间在干什么。



Mr. Wilson的悲剧性很大程度来源于他的社会阶层。他属于被工业文明遗弃的灰谷，在汽车行业流水线上最不起眼的一个位置，做着每天机械的工作，慢慢变得愚钝、麻木。而他急切想得到Tom的二手车，想靠这个赚上一笔，却反复遭受Tom的戏弄。最后，“汽车”成为了他太太死亡的致命凶器——



💧**Clue 2**: Automobile is a symbol of injury and death.



**Evidence 1**: The “death car,” as the newspapers called it, didn’t stop; it came out of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment, and then disappeared around the next bend.

那辆"凶车"——这是报纸上的提法——停都没停车于从渐浓的暮色中出现，出事后悲惨地犹疑了片刻，然后在前面一转弯就不见了。



作为一种威胁，小说中的汽车造成了各种各样的伤害：

Jordan开车擦破过工人的纽扣；（It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one man’s coat. — Chapter 3.4）

Gatsby派对上的一位客人压坏过醉汉的右手；（Snell was there three days before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel drive that Mrs. Ulysses Swett’s automobile ran over his right hand. — Chapter 4.1）

运送过死人，当过灵车；（A dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two carriages with drawn blinds, and by more cheerful carriages for friends. — Chapter 4.2）

Tom车上的一位酒店女佣撞断过胳膊；（The girl who was with him got into the papers, too, because her arm was broken — she was one of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel. — Chapter 4.4）

因此，在故事的高潮处，汽车自然而然的充当了刽子手，这是一辆“致死”的汽车，是死亡的运输者，它必会带来死亡。

**💧Things to know by the time you turn 30**

Nick突然意识到自己已经30岁了，这给他带来了恐慌和不安（Thirty — the promise of a decade of loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning brief-case of enthusiasm, thinning hair. ）

除了没有任何物质或其他方面的成就外，他在这个节点上还经历着对社会、对人性的困惑。但很快我们就会在Nick的身上看到，真正迈入30岁的标志，不在年龄，不在财富地位，而在于心智的成熟和稳定。

今日份的彩蛋我们分享的是一些最好能在30岁之前就知道的处世做人原则，它们不是进入30岁的门槛，也没法让我们一劳永逸地消除焦虑，但懂得这些原则，可以让我们无论处在哪个年龄段 ，都能有更开阔的眼界和心胸。



\1. You can do whatever you want in life.

精诚所至，金石为开

There are step by step ways to accomplish any goal. If it has been accomplished by someone else, all you have to do is choose your virtual mentor and follow in his or her footsteps.



If you are doing something that has not been done before, it is more challenging but your path can be mapped out if you take note of the things that have worked for you and those that have not. Do the things that work and pitch the ones that don't.



\2. You are responsible for every action you take in life and every condition your life is in.

做自己的选择，过自己的人生



Try to ask yourself “Who is the most motivated person to see that your life works out the way you want it to?” The answer is YOU.



So the next question is, “Who is really going to take responsibility to ensure that your life works out the way you want it to?” Again, there is only one answer.



It is YOU who makes all of the bajillion everyday decisions that drive your life.



\3. Not everyone who is an “authority” is right.

没有人是绝对“权威”



Take the following as an example and apply it to in other cases:



Whenever anyone gives you any data, check it over for yourself and see if it works for you and seems correct. If it doesn't seem correct, don't rely on it.



There is more false data out there than true data. You just have to figure out which is which.



\4. Do not seek revenge.

以直报怨，以德报德



Revenge for the sake of revenge never feels good when it is carried out and, believe it or not, it ties you to the person that you have taken revenge against. You will never be free of that person in your thoughts and mind thereafter.



Sometimes you do have to act against a person to stop the damage they are wreaking on others. This is a correct action in the grand scheme of things. But revenge just for revenge's sake is evil. I don't care how many movies make it seem okay.



\5. Life is fluid.

生活需要变通



Life changes every second of every day. If you have fixed ideas about how it is supposed to be and how you will handle things, you will take wrong steps. 



In any given situation, look at it and really see it. Plan your actions accordingly. Operating on fixed ideas and actions will only take you so far. Actual observation and action is always best.

**“Listen,” said Tom, shaking him a little.**

**“I just got here a minute ago, from New York.**

**I was bringing you that coupe we’ve been talking about.**

**That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn’t mine — do you hear?**

**I haven’t seen it all afternoon.”**

**Only the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said, but the policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent eyes.**

**“What’s all that?” he demanded.**

**“I’m a friend of his.” Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on Wilson’s body.**

**“He says he knows the car that did it . . . it was a yellow car.”**

**Some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.**

**“And what color’s your car?”**

**“It’s a blue car, a coupe.”**

**“We’ve come straight from New York,” I said.**

**Some one who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this, and the policeman turned away.**

**“Now, if you’ll let me have that name again correct ——”**

**Picking up Wilson like a doll, Tom carried him into the office, set him down in a chair, and came back.**

**“If somebody’ll come here and sit with him,” he snapped authoritatively.**

**He watched while the two men standing closest glanced at each other and went unwillingly into the room.**

**Then Tom shut the door on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the table.**

**As he passed close to me he whispered: “Let’s get out.”**

**Self-consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way,we pushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor, case in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.**

**Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend — then his foot came down hard, and the coupe raced along through the night.**

**In a little while I heard a low husky sob, and saw that the tears were overflowing down his face.**

**“The God damned coward!” he whimpered.**

**“He didn’t even stop his car.”**

**The Buchanans’ house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling trees.**

**Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor, where two windows bloomed with light among the vines.**

**“Daisy’s home,” he said.**

**As we got out of the car he glanced at me and frowned slightly.**

**“I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There’s nothing we can do to-night.”**

**A change had come over him, and he spoke gravely, and with decision.**

**As we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of the situation in a few brisk phrases.**

**“I’ll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you’re waiting you and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some supper — if you want any.”**

**He opened the door. “Come in.”**

**“No, thanks. But I’d be glad if you’d order me the taxi. I’ll wait outside.”**

**Jordan put her hand on my arm.**

**“Won’t you come in, Nick?” “No, thanks.”**

**I was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan lingered for a moment more.**

**“It’s only half-past nine,” she said.**

**I’d be damned if I’d go in; I’d had enough of all of them for one day, and suddenly that included Jordan too.**

**She must have seen something of this in my expression, for she turned abruptly away and ran up the porch steps into the house.**

**I sat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler’s voice calling a taxi.**

**Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the house, intending to wait by the gate.**

**I hadn’t gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from between two bushes into the path.**

**I must have felt pretty weird by that time, because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit under the moon.**

**“Did you see any trouble on the road?” he asked after a minute.**

**“Yes.” He hesitated.**

**“Was she killed?” “Yes.”**

**“I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It’s better that the shock should all come at once. She stood it pretty well.”**

**He spoke as if Daisy’s reaction was the only thing that mattered.**

**“I got to West Egg by a side road,” he went on, “and left the car in my garage. I don’t think anybody saw us, but of course I can’t be sure.”**

**I disliked him so much by this time that I didn’t find it necessary to tell him he was wrong.**

**“Who was the woman?” he inquired.**

**“Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did it happen?”**

**“Well, I tried to swing the wheel ——” He broke off, and suddenly I guessed at the truth.**

**“Was Daisy driving?”**

**“Yes,” he said after a moment, “but of course I’ll say I was. You see, when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would steady her to drive — and this woman rushed out at us just as we were passing a car coming the other way.**

**It all happened in a minute, but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody she knew.**

**Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back.**

**The second my hand reached the wheel I felt the shock — it must have killed her instantly.”**

**“It ripped her open ——”**

**“Don’t tell me, old sport.” He winced.**

**“Anyhow — Daisy stepped on it. I tried to make her stop, but she couldn’t, so I pulled on the emergency brake.**

**Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.**

**“She’ll be all right to-morrow,” he said presently.**

**“I’m just going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon.**

**She’s locked herself into her room, and if he tries any brutality she’s going to turn the light out and on again.”**

> ==brutality英 [brʊ'tælɪtɪ] 美 [bruˈtælɪti] n. 无情；残忍；暴行（需用复数形式）==

**“He won’t touch her,’ I said.**

**“He’s not thinking about her.”**

**“I don’t trust him, old sport.”**

**“How long are you going to wait?”**

**“All night, if necessary. Anyhow, till they all go to bed.”**

**A new point of view occurred to me.**

**Suppose Tom found out that Daisy had been driving.**

**He might think he saw a connection in it — he might think anything.**

**I looked at the house; there were two or three bright windows down-stairs and the pink glow from Daisy’s room on the second floor.**

**“You wait here,” I said. “I’ll see if there’s any sign of a commotion.”**

> ==commotion英 [kə'məʊʃ(ə)n] 美 [kəˈmoʊʃn] n. 骚动；暴乱==

**I walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel softly,and tiptoed up the veranda steps.**

**The drawing-room curtains were open, and I saw that the room was empty.**

**Crossing the porch where we had dined that June night three months before, I came to a small rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window.**

**The blind was drawn, but I found a rift at the sill.**

**Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table, with a plate of cold fried chicken between them, and two bottles of ale.**

**He was talking intently across the table at her, and in his earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own.**

> ==earnestness英 ['ə:nistnis] 美 ['ɜ:nɪstnəs] n. 认真；诚挚；正经==

**Once in a while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.**

**As I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the dark road toward the house.**

**Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in the drive.**

**“Is it all quiet up there?” he asked anxiously.**

**“Yes, it’s all quiet.” I hesitated.**

**“You’d better come home and get some sleep.” He shook his head.**

**“I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport.”**

**He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil.**

### 背景知识

**💧Trespassing law in America**

**小心别犯了“非法入侵罪”**

我们先来回顾原文当中出现的一个场景：

I walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel softly, and tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains were open, and I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where we had dined that June night three months before, I came to a small rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window. The blind was drawn, but I found a rift at the sill.

我沿着草坪的边缘走了回去，轻轻跨过石子车道，然后踮起脚尖走上游廊的台阶。客厅的窗帘是拉开的，因此我看到屋子里是空的。我穿过我们三个月以前那个六月的晚上吃过晚餐的阳台，来到一小片长方形的灯光前面，我猜那是食品间的窗户。遮帘拉了下来，但我在窗台上找到了一个缝隙。

Nick为了帮Gatsby打探屋里的情况，悄悄地重新潜回到门口，还从窗外往里偷窥。但是这个举动在现实生活中可不值得效仿，否则随时有可能被扣上“非法入侵罪”的帽子。

私闯民宅，在美国称为“Trespassing”. 由于美国大部分的住宅，都是别墅式的，所以在四周又有花园。有的园子很大，是几公顷甚至几百公顷。除了住宅以外，店铺，办公室等地点，亦属“私宅”。

美国是私有制国家，保护私人的财产不受侵犯或打扰，是美国民生之大法。走在美国的街道上，观赏美丽的小区或商业街，你要想到：这一切你所看到的，均为私有财产。

对于这些“私宅”，美国法律明文规定，任何人，包括执法机关，没有正当理由，不许对其进行任何骚扰。（注：私宅，包括房子的前门和外边通往大街的阶梯。）

### 课文理解

昨天我们介绍了death car作为本书重要的象征之一，代表了伤害和死亡（injury and death）. 今天我们会从Myrtle死亡本身出发，揭示这一事件和美国梦主题之间的关系。



💧**Clue 1**: Myrtle's death indicates the false promise of American dream.

Myrtle在故事里的形象几乎完全就是“物欲”（physicality）的代表，她是灰谷里脱颖而出的一个不甘于现状并且渴望进入上流社会的代表（和她的丈夫完全相反）。她急于摆脱自己卑微的阶层地位，希冀能借助Tom实现麻雀变凤凰的梦想。

所以当她和丈夫发生争吵时，她本能地向以为是Tom正在驾驶的汽车跑去（早些时候她透过窗户看到Tom开着黄色的车，所以当Daisy和Gatsby开着那辆黄色的车回程的时候，Myrtle便误以为里面坐的是Tom）——



**Evidence 1**: “It all happened in a minute, but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody she knew.”

"前后不到一分钟的事，但我觉得她想跟我们说话，以为我们是她认识的人。"

虽然Tom不是直接的凶手，但这一幕也颇具象征意义——Myrtle所迫切渴望的名利财富（这是汽车在本书中的另一个象征，可以回看前文对Gatsby这辆黄色小轿车的描述，它是Gatsby自我炫耀的工具之一）最后成为了她的致命凶器。

她永远无法进入Tom的阶层，即便当时开车的是Tom, 即便Tom停了下来，他也不会带Myrtle离开，或是为了她和Daisy离婚。Myrtle的尝试和努力注定是无用的，而且还造成了她最后的悲剧。因此作者想要表达的是，美国梦其实是残忍而虚假的，妄图追寻它并且深陷其中的人，最后遭遇的可能是粉身碎骨。

Myrtle的悲剧命运其实也是本书的另一个角色——Gatsby的预言。他怀抱着比Myrtle更为强烈真挚的浪漫幻想，甚至可以说飞蛾扑火、自我牺牲式的。比如今天的情节里，他默默无闻地站在Daisy家外的灌木丛里守望——



💧**Clue 2**: Gatsby's love for Daisy is self-sacrificing.



**Evidence 1**: “She’ll be all right to-morrow,” he said presently. “I’m just going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon. She’s locked herself into her room, and if he tries any brutality she’s going to turn the light out and on again.”

"明天她就会好的，"他过了一会又说，"我只是在这儿等等，看他会不会因为今天下午那场争执找她麻烦。她把自己锁在自己屋子里了，假如他有什么野蛮的举动，她就会把灯关掉然后再打开。"

显然Gatsby和Daisy约定好了，如果Tom有什么异常的举动，Daisy会用灯光来告知Gatsby. 但即便是Nick在踏进院子透过窗户观察里面的动向，发现一切都非常平和的时候，Gatsby也不愿意离开，坚持要等到Daisy关灯入睡（“I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport”）.

Gatsby的执着虔诚甚至已经让Nick觉得仿佛自己如果再打扰他，就会侵犯了这份守望的“神圣性”（as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil）. 这份付出是否会得到相应的回报？Nick在末尾留下的轻描淡写的一句埋下了伏笔：

So I walked away and left him standing there in the moonlight — watching over nothing.

### 今日彩蛋

**💧nerve的俚语表达**



Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back.（呃，黛西先是把车子从那个女人那边转向那辆车子，接着她惊慌失措又转了回去。）

 

to lose one's nerve 指“（因为太害怕）而没有勇气做”（to suddenly become very nervous so that you cannot do what you intended to do）. 这里指Daisy本来是要往另外一辆车撞过去的，但最后因为太害怕而调转了方向。

 

关于nerve还有很多俚语表达，我们一起来看看~



\1. to have a lot of nerve

行事莽撞粗鲁

nerve在这里相当于口语里的cheek, 表示“ 令人讨厌（或粗鲁、无礼）的话（或行为） ”，比如：What a cheek/nerve!（“真不要脸！”）

"You took my seat! You have a lot of nerve sitting there!"（你占了我的位置！你坐在这真是厚颜无耻 ！）



\2. to hit / touch a (raw) nerve 

触及要害/痛处

指无意间说了让别人不高兴或是令人尴尬的话（to accidentally upset someone by talking about something that they feel strongly about or are very sensitive about）.

You touched a raw nerve when you mentioned his first wife.

你谈起他的第一个妻子，这就触到了他的痛处。



\3. to have nerves of steel 

意志坚强；沉着冷静 

nerves of steel “像钢铁一般的神经（意志）”，也就是非常“坚强、冷静”（to be able to remain calm in a difficult or dangerous situation）.

The job requires nerves of steel.

做这份工作需要有坚强的意志。



\4. to get on one's nerves 

使心神不宁

一般指“某件事一直在重复而令人感觉心烦”（to annoy somebody by doing something all the time）.

She’s always moaning. It really gets on my nerves.

她老是在哼哼唧唧的，真令我心烦。



\5. to be a bundle of nerves / a bag of nerves

极度焦虑/恐惧

nerves在这里指“种种担心的情绪”（worried feelings）, 也就是形容一个人“浑身每根神经都处于焦虑和紧张当中”。

I remember you were a bundle of nerves on your wedding day.

我记得你在婚礼那天紧张极了。

**I couldn’t sleep all night; a fog-horn was groaning incessantly on the Sound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage, frightening dreams.**

**Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsby’s drive, and immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dress — I felt that I had something to tell him, something to warn him about, and morning would be too late.**

**Crossing his lawn, I saw that his front door was still open and he was leaning against a table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep.**

> ==dejection英 [dɪ'dʒekʃ(ə)n] 美 [dɪˈdʒɛkʃən] n. 沮丧==

**“Nothing happened,” he said wanly.**

**“I waited, and about four o’clock she came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out the light.”**

**His house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when we hunted through the great rooms for cigarettes.**

**We pushed aside curtains that were like pavilions, and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for electric light switches — once I tumbled with a sort of splash upon the keys of a ghostly piano.**

> ==pavilion英 [pə'vɪljən] 美 [pəˈvɪljən] n. 阁；亭子；大帐篷==

**There was an inexplicable amount of dust everywhere, and the rooms were musty, as though they hadn’t been aired for many days.**

**I found the humidor on an unfamiliar table, with two stale, dry cigarettes inside.**

**Throwing open the French windows of the drawing-room, we sat smoking out into the darkness.**

**“You ought to go away,” I said. “It’s pretty certain they’ll trace your car.”**

**“Go away now, old sport?”**

**“Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal.”**

**He wouldn’t consider it.**

**He couldn’t possibly leave Daisy until he knew what she was going to do.**

**He was clutching at some last hope and I couldn’t bear to shake him free.**

**It was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with Dan Cody — told it to me because “Jay Gatsby” had broken up like glass against Tom’s hard malice, and the long secret extravaganza was played out.**

> <font color=red>It was this night / that he told me the strange story / of his youth with Dan Cody — / told it to me / because “Jay Gatsby” / had broken up like glass / against Tom’s hard malice, / and the long secret extravaganza / was played out.</font>

> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ① “Jay Gatsby” had broken up like glass against Tom’s hard malice “‘杰伊·盖茨比’已经像玻璃一样在汤姆的铁硬的恶意上碰得粉碎”；“Jay Gatsby”是代表了Gatsby精心编织的一切，包括他给自己打造的新身份（17岁的时候他把自己的名字从James Gatz改为Jay Gatsby）; hard malice指“冷酷的恶意 ”，hard从“坚硬的”引申为“冷酷无情的”，这里指Tom在纽约的时候毫不留情地拆穿了Gatsby的谎言；
>
> ②the long secret extravaganza was played out“那出漫长的秘密狂想剧也演完了”；extravaganza指“盛大、华丽的表演”，并且内容往往是荒诞狂妄的，这里指Gatsby对Daisy长达5年的爱恋，尤其是他为了赢得Daisy而做的一切浪漫铺张的举动；played out即finished;
>
> *这里暗示了Gatsby的失败（downfall），两方面：在纽约的聚会上，Tom让Gatsby看清了Daisy并没有那么爱他（Daisy doesn't love Gatsby as he loves her）; Gatsby在Daisy家门口守候到了清晨4点，结果什么也没有发生（Tom和Daisy之间没有发生Gatsby预想甚至期待的问题）。

**I think that he would have acknowledged anything now, without reserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy.**

**She was the first “nice” girl he had ever known.**

**In various unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such people, but always with indiscernible barbed wire between.**

> ==indiscernible英 [,ɪndɪ'sɜːnɪb(ə)l] 美 [ˌɪndɪˈsɜ:rnəbl] adj. 难识别的；看不见的==

**He found her excitingly desirable.**

**He went to her house, at first with other officers from Camp Taylor, then alone.**

> ④but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year’s shining motor-cars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered “而是鲜活的，使人联想到今年崭新锃亮的汽车、 联想到鲜花仍未凋零的舞会”（注意这里形容的是romances）；fresh and breathing指“鲜活的”，redolent of指“使人想起……的”，相当于reminiscent of.

### 背景知识

**💧Holy Grail 圣杯**

...but now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail.（但是现在他发现他已经把自己献身于追求一种理想。）

the following of a grail翻译成了“追求一种理想”，这里是取grail的引申义：“努力追去的目标，渴望之物”（something that a person is trying very hard to obtain or achieve）. 但grail本身是指“圣杯”（也写作holy grail）, 是宗教传说中的圣物。

圣杯来源于基督教的传统，指在公元33年，犹太历尼散月十四日，也就是耶稣受难前的逾越节晚餐上，耶稣遣走加略人犹大后和11个门徒所使用的一个葡萄酒杯子（the drinking glass used by Jesus at the Last Supper）. 耶稣曾经拿起这个杯子吩咐门徒喝下里面象征他的血的红葡萄酒，借此创立了受难纪念仪式。

因此后来有些人认为这个杯子因为这个特殊的场合而具有某种神奇的能力。比如很多传说相信，如果能找到这个圣杯而喝下其盛过的水就将返老还童、死而复生并且获得永生，这个传说还广泛延续到很多文学、影视、游戏等作品中。

目前在欧洲大约有200个古酒杯被认为可能是传说中的圣杯，著名的有瓦伦西亚大教堂的瓦伦西亚圣杯（Valencia Chalice）、圣老楞佐主教座堂的热那亚圣杯（Genoa Chalice）等。

### 课文理解

Gatsby给Nick详细描述了他和Daisy第一次见面的情景：Gatsby和军营里的其他军官一起到Daisy家，他第一眼就被里面的富丽堂皇震慑住了。后来两人坠入爱河，并且也有过非常甜蜜的幽会。接着Gatsby被派到前线。原本应该顺利返程的他，因为一些差错又被送到了牛津。这时候的Daisy已经无法按捺了，于是重新投身于社交场合，并在Tom出现后闪电结婚。

透过Nick的笔触和视角，我们可以发现在Gatsby和Daisy的感情中有两个非常重要的前提，这也解释了为什么Daisy这样的富家女会爱上穷小子Gatsby, 以及Gatsby对Daisy为什么会有如此强烈的欲望和执念——



💧**Clue 1**: Gatsby has been cheating Daisy about some parts of himself.

Gatsby对Daisy并没有绝对的坦诚，至少他有意地让Daisy相信了自己和她能够门当户对：



**Evidence 1**: However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders.

但是，他明白他之所以能出入黛西家里纯粹是出于偶然，不管他作为杰伊·盖茨比会有何等的锦绣前程，目前他只是一个默默无闻、一文不名的青年人，而且他的军服——这件看不见的外衣随时都可能从他肩上滑落下来。



Gatsby在踏入Daisy家的那一刻，就知道了这是一个仅靠自己原本的出身绝对无法高攀的地方。在他过往的接触中，他已经尝到了什么是不可逾越的鸿沟（but always with indiscernible barbed wire between “总有一层无形的带刺的铁丝网隔在中间”）。但Gatsby与众不同的地方就在于，他有着蓬勃的野心和永远活力充沛的幻想。所以他选择了提前把这个幻梦“实现”，他让Daisy相信自己能够给她足够的安全感，尤其是物质上的：



**Evidence 2**: I don’t mean that he had traded on his phantom millions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he let her believe that he was a person from much the same stratum as herself — that he was fully able to take care of her.

他也许应该鄙视自己的，因为他确实用欺骗的手段占有了她，我不是说他利用了他那虚幻的百万家财。但是他有意给黛西造成一种安全感，让她相信他的出身跟她不相上下——相信他完全能够照料她。



我们不知道Gatsby到底跟Daisy说了什么，只能猜测他并没有直接假意宣扬自己有多少财产，而是用很巧妙的方法俘获了Daisy的芳心。



💧**Clue 2**: Gatsby is not only hooked by Daisy herself.



在Gatsby和Daisy的关系中，Gatsby的感情可能要复杂的多。他在不经意间也透露了自己起初爱上Daisy其实还有其他的原因——



**Evidence 1**: It excited him, too, that many men had already loved Daisy — it increased her value in his eyes.

同样使他激动的，还有很多男人都曾经爱过黛西。这抬高了Daisy在他眼里的价值。



Gatsby爱上Daisy不是没有虚荣心在作祟的。他看到Daisy住在这样华丽的屋子里，并且举手投足间都是富家子女才有的傲然自恃（it was as casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to him “这房子对于她就像他在军营里的帐篷对于他一样地平淡无奇”）。而他从来没有这种物质富足所带来的满足和自信，所以燃起了渴望和向往。更何况这个女孩还是大家都竞相追求的对象。



**Evidence 2**: But he didn’t despise himself and it didn’t turn out as he had imagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go — but now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail.

但是他并没有鄙视自己，事情的结果也出乎他的意料。他起初很可能打算及时行乐，然后一走了之——但是现在他发现他已经把自己献身于追求一种理想。



Gatsby并没有因为对Daisy的欺骗而鄙视自己，相反，他越来越深陷其中。而且，他还发现了另一件吸引他的事，就是实现一个理想：发家致富，直到自己可以理所应当地站在Daisy身边。 这也暗示了比起得到Daisy本身，让Gatsby着迷其中的，还有他的自我满足和成就感。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧和国家/民族有关的复合短语**

原文：Throwing open the French windows of the drawing-room, we sat smoking out into the darkness.

French windows在这里可不是指“法国的窗”哦~正解是“落地窗”。当然落地窗并不是跟法国完全没有关系，它起源于French doors, 时间大概是17世纪。当时这种门是由一块块独立的玻璃和木板镶嵌而成的（constructed of individual, single paned pieces of glass and wood）, 看起来更像窗户而不是门，所以有了French windows的叫法。

在英语里还有不少类似和国家/民族有关的短语，但是从字面上是猜不出意思的哦~我们一起来看看吧！



\1. French leave

不告而别

这个短语原本是在军队中使用的，表示“不打报告而擅自离开、开小差”。引申到日常生活就是“擅自离开，不辞而别”，但这种行为在西方文化里是非常不礼貌的，尤其是在参加聚会的时候，一般离开的时候一定要先跟主人打招呼。

例句：Did she take French leave at the party last Saturday? 

她在上星期六的宴会中不告而别吗？



\2. Indian giver

送礼物后又讨回的人

这个短语源自美国土著印第安人的传统习惯。印第安人没有货币和金钱的概念，他们的经济交易方式是以物易物。所以在他们的观念中，礼物也是商品交换的一种。只要在得到等价交换的礼物回礼时（equivalent value in return）, 他们才会送出礼物。如果对方没有等价礼物回赠，那送出的礼物可能会被拒绝或是归还。



例句：Toby may have given you these books, but don't start celebrating yet. He's famous for being an Indian giver.

托比可能送给你这几本书了，但是不要高兴的太早。他送东西又往回要，是出了名的。



\3. Spanish athlete

爱吹牛的人

6世纪，西班牙建立了强大的海军，认为自己战无不胜，简直无敌。后来被英国打败，英国人便嘲笑西班牙人爱吹牛。当时的西班牙运动员在比赛前也喜欢说大话，但结果往往不如预期，因此“Spanish athlete”就有了“爱吹牛皮的人”的意思。

例句：Jack has been a Spanish athlete since he was 5!

杰克从 5 岁开始就很爱吹牛了！



\4. Greek gift

图谋害人的礼物

该词组源自《木马屠城记》：在特洛伊战争中，希腊人将藏满士兵的木马送进特洛伊城，灭亡了特洛伊。所以“Greek gift”指“图谋害人的礼物”，其实也就是汉语里的“黄鼠狼给鸡拜年——不安好心”~

例句：Ware his gift, that is a Greek gift!

小心他的礼物，那是包藏杀机的礼物！

**I missed that train, and then another, before I could get myself away.**

**“I’ll call you up,” I said finally.**

**“Do, old sport.” “I’ll call you about noon.”**

**We walked slowly down the steps.**

**“I suppose Daisy’ll call too.”**

**“I suppose so.”**

**“Well, good-by.”**

**We shook hands and I started away.**

**Just before I reached the hedge I remembered something and turned around.**

**“They’re a rotten crowd,” I shouted across the lawn.**

**“You’re worth the whole damn bunch put together.”**

**I’ve always been glad I said that.**

**It was the only compliment I ever gave him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end.**

**First he nodded politely, and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding smile, as if we’d been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time.**

**His gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of color against the white steps, and I thought of the night when I first came to his ancestral home, three months before.**

**The lawn and drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his corruption — and he had stood on those steps, concealing his incorruptible dream, as he waved them good-by.**

**Just before noon the phone woke me, and I started up with sweat breaking out on my forehead.**

**It was Jordan Baker; she often called me up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements between hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find in any other way.**

**Usually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool, as if a divot from a green golf-links had come sailing in at the office window, but this morning it seemed harsh and dry.**

**“I’ve left Daisy’s house,” she said.**

**“I’m at Hempstead, and I’m going down to Southampton this afternoon.”**

**Probably it had been tactful to leave Daisy’s house, but the act annoyed me, and her next remark made me rigid.**

**“You weren’t so nice to me last night.”**

**“How could it have mattered then?”**

**Silence for a moment. Then:**

**“However — I want to see you.”**

**“I want to see you, too.”**

**“No — I don’t think this afternoon.”**

**I couldn’t have talked to her across a tea-table that day if I never talked to her again in this world.**

**Taking out my time-table, I drew a small circle around the three-fifty train.**

**Then I leaned back in my chair and tried to think. It was just noon.**

**When I passed the ashheaps on the train that morning I had crossed deliberately to the other side of the car.**

**I suppose there’d be a curious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark spots in the dust,**

**and some garrulous man telling over and over what had happened, until it became less and less real even to him and he could tell it no longer, and Myrtle Wilson’s tragic achievement was forgotten.**

**Now I want to go back a little and tell what happened at the garage after we left there the night before.**

**They had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine.**

**She must have broken her rule against drinking that night, for when she arrived she was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance had already gone to Flushing.**

**When they convinced her of this, she immediately fainted, as if that was the intolerable part of the affair.**

**Some one, kind or curious, took her in his car and drove her in the wake of her sister’s body.**

**Until long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front of the garage, while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on the couch inside.**

**For a while the door of the office was open, and every one who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it.**

**Finally someone said it was a shame, and closed the door.**

**Michaelis and several other men were with him; first, four or five men, later two or three men.**

**Still later Michaelis had to ask the last stranger to wait there fifteen minutes longer, while he went back to his own place and made a pot of coffee.**

**After that, he stayed there alone with Wilson until dawn.**

### 背景知识

**💧Day coach以及其他种类的列车**

原文：The day-coach — he was penniless now — was hot.

Gatsby为了到Louisville去一趟，花光了自己仅剩的军饷，最后只能选择坐炎热拥挤的day coach. 这里的day coach就是指“硬座列车”，一般只提供坐席，并且环境和服务设施都相对简陋，这和白天的路线都比较短有关。

用于运载乘客的统称为“客运列车”（passenger car）, coach是里面最常见的一种，专指“以座椅设置为主的”，也叫作chair cars. coach还分别有两种类型（viriants）：



\1. "open" coach 敞开式坐席列车

座椅成排分布在中央走道的两边（with row upon row of seats on the sides of the center corridor）



\2. "closed" coach (或compartment car) 包厢式坐席列车

两排座位相对，一侧是通道，一侧靠窗（a side corridor to connect individual compartments along the body of the train, each with two rows of seats facing each other）, 如下↓

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/89a10a12052f3abc4d9b9b1706df8c14-sz_125670.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



除了coach这种坐席列车外，为了保证乘客旅途的舒适以及满足更高的需求，还设计了其他种类的列车：



\3. Sleeping car 卧铺列车



和day coach只跑白天的短途不一样，跑夜间长途的列车更需要给旅客提供更舒适的休息（to make nighttime travel more restful），所以有了sleeping car, 也可以叫sleeper或Pullman cars, 因为这种列车是由一个叫George Pullman的美国人在19世纪30年代设计的。

*如果需要给外国朋友解释我们的卧铺列车就可以用到sleeper这个词啦~比如“硬卧”是hard sleeper (normally with six bunks per compartment), “软卧”则是soft sleeper (typically with four bunks).



\4. Lounge car 观景列车



作为提供奢华服务的观景列车（to offer superior comforts and amenities），其实一般只是设置为列车的其中一节车厢，挨着餐车（pulled in addition to the dining car）. 里面有吧台（bar）, 长凳（bench）, 扶手椅（armchair）, 可旋转座椅（swivelling chair）等等，有的甚至还会摆一台小钢琴以及安排乐手进行表演（some may even include small pianos and are staffed by contracted musicians to entertain the passengers）.



总之就是穷尽一切可能给列车上的旅客提供消遣娱乐，这也是它比其他交通工具（飞机、巴士以及汽车）更具吸引力的地方——更多的活动、社交、饮食空间（more space to move around, socialize, eat and drink）, 还有窗外非常棒的视野（a good view）.

### 课文理解

Nick和Gatsby一直交谈到黎明，Gatsby也回忆了自己归国后一人重游故地的怅然若失。而回到现实中，我们除了可以从Nick的叙述语气中感觉到故事已经接近尾声——也就是Falling action的阶段（在高潮之后，还留有悬念没有解决），同时还可以从环境描写中捕捉到这种衰败的态势，也就是季节的突然变化——



💧**Clue 1**: There is a sharp turn of the weather.



**Evidence 1**: There was a slow, pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool, lovely day.

空气中有一种慢慢的愉快的动静，还说不上是风，预示着凉爽宜人的天气。



**Evidence 2**: The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there was an autumn flavor in the air.

一夜之间天气骤然变了，空气中已经有秋意。



故事是以夏天开始的，并且情节的冲突、人物的情感，也都暗暗和气候的变化相吻合。比如到了高潮，也就是Tom, Gatsby以及Daisy的三角关系被揭露的时候，正好是最炎热的一天。而在今天的内容里，气候突然进入了秋天。除了象征感情和冲突的逐渐平息，也预示着故事的悬念很快就要水落石出。



但另一方面，Gatsby的执念并没有就此放弃，从两个细节就可以看出来——



💧**Clue 2**: Gatsby is not to give up on his dream.



**Evidence 1**: “I’m going to drain the pool to-day, Mr. Gatsby. Leaves’ll start falling pretty soon, and then there’s always trouble with the pipes.”

“Don’t do it to-day,” Gatsby answered. He turned to me apologetically. “You know, old sport, I’ve never used that pool all summer?”

"我今天准备把游泳池的水放掉，盖茨比先生。树叶很快就要开始落了，那样水管子就一定会堵塞。"

"今天不要搞。"盖茨比回答。他含有歉意地转身对着我，"你知道吗，老兄，我整个夏天从来没用过那个游泳池！"



当老佣人说要把泳池的水放掉的时候，Gatsby拒绝了。其实这个举动很有象征意义——对于他来说，夏天还没有完全过去；或者说，他还试图抓住仅存的一点重温旧梦的希望。



**Evidence 2**: “I suppose Daisy’ll call too.” He looked at me anxiously, as if he hoped I’d corroborate this.

"我想黛西也会打电话来的。"他神色不安地看着我，仿佛他希望我证实他的话。



尽管等了一整晚Daisy似乎都没什么动静（他心里一定是有失落的），但Gatsby还是觉得Daisy会给自己来电话。只是在Nick看来，他已经少了很多不确定。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧The best compliments you could ever give**



“They’re a rotten crowd,” I shouted across the lawn. “You’re worth the whole damn bunch put together.”

"他们是一帮混蛋，"我隔着草坪喊道，"他们那帮人加起来都比不上你。"

这是Nick发自肺腑的对Gatsby的称赞。并且连Nick自己都觉得很庆幸说了这句话，虽然从头到尾他都对Gatsby持鄙夷态度。而听到这句话的Gatsby也露出了会心一笑。

其实人和人之间往往就是这样黏合起来的。两个人的亲近和连接并不在于平时说了多少好话，只需要关键时刻的一句赞美，就可以建立起宝贵的理解和信任。那么称赞别人都有哪些走心的表达呢？马上给大家奉上~



\1. You are nothing less than special.

你是无与伦比的特别。

*nothing less than “不亚于”，其实就是在强调“完完全全地，简直”（completely, exactly）.

\2. You are one of a kind.

你是独一无二的。



*这里的a kind其实就是在说对方是“独一无二的”，独属于一个“品类”的，比如身上有别人所没有的特质。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/340638027908e1120cc47995dfe9337b-sz_21398.png)



\3. You are the most perfect you there is.

这样的你就是最完美的。



*这句话其实就是在说：If there is a most perfect you, you are the one.

\4. You are the best friend/wife/husband anyone could ask for.

遇见你，三生有幸。



![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/920d171d66cc9da04ce21402e3753935-sz_55669.jpg?x-oss-process=image/resize,w_1080/auto-orient,1/crop,x_44,y_96,w_406,h_495)



\5. You have a heart of gold.

你有一颗金子般的心。



*把一个人的心比喻成金子其实并不俗气，因为这不是每个人都能拥有的，毕竟大部分人都只是金玉其外而败絮其中。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/d16b8a6ec392c1e7fe05ef941ac1d4cc-sz_1051756.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



\6. Thank you for being you.

你是你，真好。

最后还想跟大家分享一句话：Like attracts like. 所以大胆地向身边的人送出自己的赞美吧~

**About three o’clock the quality of Wilson’s incoherent muttering changed — he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car.**

**He announced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car belonged to, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen.**

**“Twelve years.”**

**“Ever had any children? Come on, George, sit still — I asked you a question. Did you ever have any children?”**

**The hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light, and whenever Michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him like the car that hadn’t stopped a few hours before.**

**He didn’t like to go into the garage, because the work bench was stained where the body had been lying, so he moved uncomfortably around the office —**

**he knew every object in it before morning — and from time to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep him more quiet.**

**“Have you got a church you go to sometimes, George?**

**Maybe even if you haven’t been there for a long time?**

**Maybe I could call up the church and get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see?”**

**“Don’t belong to any.”**

**“You ought to have a church, George, for times like this.**

**You must have gone to church once.**

**Didn’t you get married in a church?**

**Listen, George, listen to me.**

**Didn’t you get married in a church?”**

**Then the same half-knowing, half-bewildered look came back into his faded eyes.**

**“Look in the drawer there,” he said, pointing at the desk.**

**“Which drawer?”**

**“That drawer — that one.”**

**Michaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand.**

**There was nothing in it but a small, expensive dog-leash, made of leather and braided silver.**

**It was apparently new.**

**“This?” he inquired, holding it up.**

**Wilson stared and nodded.**

**“I found it yesterday afternoon. She tried to tell me about it, but I knew it was something funny.”**

**“You mean your wife bought it?”**

**“She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau.”**

**Michaelis didn’t see anything odd in that, and he gave Wilson a dozen reasons why his wife might have bought the dog-leash.**

**But conceivably Wilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle, because he began saying “Oh, my God!” again in a whisper — his comforter left several explanations in the air.**

**“Then he killed her,” said Wilson.**

**His mouth dropped open suddenly. “Who did?”**

**“I have a way of finding out.”**

**“You’re morbid, George,” said his friend.**

**“This has been a strain to you and you don’t know what you’re saying. You’d better try and sit quiet till morning.”**

**“He murdered her.”**

**“It was an accident, George.” Wilson shook his head.**

**His eyes narrowed and his mouth widened slightly with the ghost of a superior “Hm!”**

**“I know,” he said definitely, “I’m one of these trusting fellas and I don’t think any harm to nobody, but when I get to know a thing I know it.**

**It was the man in that car. She ran out to speak to him and he wouldn’t stop.”**

**Michaelis had seen this too, but it hadn’t occurred to him that there was any special significance in it.**

**He believed that Mrs. Wilson had been running away from her husband, rather than trying to stop any particular car.**

**“How could she of been like that?”**

**“She’s a deep one,” said Wilson, as if that answered the question. “Ah-h-h ——”**

**He began to rock again, and Michaelis stood twisting the leash inhis hand.**

**“Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George?”**

**This was a forlorn hope — he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend: there was not enough of him for his wife.**

**He was glad a little later when he noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window, and realized that dawn wasn’t far off.**

**About five o’clock it was blue enough outside to snap off the light.**

**Wilson’s glazed eyes turned out to the ashheaps, where small gray clouds took on fantastic shape and scurried here and there in the faint dawn wind.**

**“I spoke to her,” he muttered, after a long silence.**

**“I told her she might fool me but she couldn’t fool God. I took her to the window.”**

**— with an effort he got up and walked to the rear window and leaned with his face pressed againstit ——**

**and I said ‘God knows what you’ve been doing, everything you’ve been doing. You may fool me, but you can’t fool God!’”**

**Standing behind him, Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, which had just emerged, pale and enormous, from the dissolving night.**

**“God sees everything,” repeated Wilson.**

**“That’s an advertisement,” Michaelis assured him.**

**Something made him turn away from the window and look back into the room.**

**But Wilson stood there a long time, his face close to the window pane, nodding into the twilight.**

**By six o’clock Michaelis was worn out, and grateful for the sound of a car stopping outside.**

**It was one of the watchers of the night before who had promised to come back, so he cooked breakfast for three, which he and the other man ate together.**

**Wilson was quieter now, and Michaelis went home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and hurried back to the garage, Wilson was gone.**

**His movements — he was on foot all the time — were afterward traced to Port Roosevelt and then to Gad’s Hill, where he bought a sandwich that he didn’t eat, and a cup of coffee.**

**He must have been tired and walking slowly, for he didn’t reach Gad’s Hill until noon.**

**Thus far there was no difficulty in accounting for his time —**

**there were boys who had seen a man “acting sort of crazy,” and motorists at whom he stared oddly from the side of the road.**

**Then for three hours he disappeared from view.**

**The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis, that he “had a way of finding out,” supposed that he spent that time going from garage to garage thereabout, inquiring for a yellow car.**

**On the other hand, no garage man who had seen him ever came forward, and perhaps he had an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to know.**

**By half-past two he was in West Egg, where he asked someone the way to Gatsby’s house.**

**So by that time he knew Gatsby’s name.**

**At two o’clock Gatsby put on his bathing-suit and left word with the butler that if any one phoned word was to be brought to him at the pool.**

**He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused his guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him pump it up.**

> ==pneumatic英 [njuː'mætɪk] 美 [nu:ˈmætɪk] adj. 充气的；有气胎的n. 气胎==

**Then he gave instructions that the open car wasn’t to be taken out under any circumstances — and this was strange, because the front right fender needed repair.**

**Gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool.**

**Once he stopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he needed help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among the yellowing trees.**

**No telephone message arrived, but the butler went without his sleep and waited for it until four o’clock —until long after there was any one to give it to if it came.**

**I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn’t believe it would come, and perhaps he no longer cared.**

**If that was true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world,paid a high price for living too long with a single dream.**

**He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass.**

### 背景知识

**💧“灰谷”及周边的现实原型**

Wilson从灰谷步行到长岛，路过了两个地方：Port Roosevelt（“罗斯福港”）和Gad's Hill（盖德山）: His movements — he was on foot all the time — were afterward traced to Port Roosevelt and then to Gad’s Hill...

Port Roosevelt和Gad's Hill其是虚构的地名，但灰谷本身以及周边的地方都有现实的原型。首先来看灰谷的所在地：

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/08bd546717acd302c102e5ef042abd21-sz_266437.png)



灰谷紧挨法拉盛区（Flushing）, 在原文的两处地方出现过，比如当Myrtle的妹妹Catherine得知姐姐发生车祸后匆忙赶来，却没有意识到救护车已经开到法拉盛区了：...when she arrived she was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance had already gone to Flushing.（Chapter 8.2）

以及在Gatsby的葬礼上，牧师匆忙从法拉盛赶来：A little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing...

而灰谷的所在地现在是一个公园，叫作Flushing Meadows-Corona Park（法拉盛草地公园）

不过在Fitzegerald写作的那个年代，这里的确就是一个堆满灰烬、垃圾和粪肥的恶臭之地（a swamp that was being filled with ashes, garbage, and manure）.

还有一件有意思的轶事，Fitzegerald的一个熟识Max Gerlach就住在灰谷，而且和Mr. Wilson的形象很接近。他也是倒卖二手车的（an used-car salesman）, 而且根据Fitzegerald研究学者的考证，很有可能就是他教会了Fitzegerald “old sport”这个词，所以Fitzegerald才把它用在了小说里，而且成为了Gatsby的口头禅。

### 课文理解

Mr. Wilson在事发后一直处于极端的精神煎熬中，他同时遭受着妻子出轨以及意外惨死的震慑和痛苦。于是他决定无论如何都要找到肇事车的车主然后实施报复，并且他还坚信肇事者就是妻子的秘密情人。但这时候的他已经完全失去了理智——

💧**Clue 1**: Wilson‘s killing Gatsby is irrational.

**Evidence 1**: “I know,” he said definitely, “I’m one of these trusting fellas and I don’t think any harm to nobody, but when I get to know a thing I know it. It was the man in that car. She ran out to speak to him and he wouldn’t stop.”

"我知道，"他肯定地说，"我是个信任别人的人，从来也不怀疑任何人有鬼，但是只要我弄明白了一件事，就不会有错的。是那辆车子里的那个男人。她跑过去想跟他说话，但是他不肯停下来。"

Wilson坚信是Mrytle的情人开着那辆车，然后把她撞死的。在他看来，这不是“事故”（accident）, 而是“谋杀”（murder）——“He murdered her.” 但这纯粹只是Wilson的联想，并没有实际的证据。



**Evidence 2**: Standing behind him, Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, which had just emerged, pale and enormous, from the dissolving night.

“God sees everything,” repeated Wilson.

米切里斯站在他背后，吃惊地看到他正盯着T·J·埃克尔堡大夫的眼睛，暗淡无光，巨大无比，刚刚从消散的夜色中显现出来。

"上帝看见一切。"威尔逊又说了一遍。

Wilson并没有宗教信仰（在这一幕之前，Michaelis问过他有没有常去的教堂，但Wilson说没有），可是当他处于崩溃边缘的时候，他却仿佛在那幅Eckleburg大夫的海报上找到自己的精神支柱。他把自己的仇恨之心投射在那双眼睛上，他相信那代表着上帝的审判。

这里一再印证了Eckleburg大夫之眼在本书中作为“上帝之眼”的象征，但作者同时也揭示了在这双仿佛代表公正和公义的“上帝之眼”背后，其实早已经是道德信仰的完全败坏和沦落。而Wilson只是无数个悲剧人物中的一个——生活失去了道德中心，一举一动都只是生理欲望的驱使。所以他在仇恨、自责、内疚的交织下，最后走向痴癫。

与之完全相反的，是Gatsby中枪身亡的场景。Nick描写得非常克制平静，而且没有直接提及Gatsby的尸体如何，只是很隐晦地通过“its (the mattress) accidental burden”来暗指。但在轻描淡写之下，Nick其实也暗示了Gatsby的死远不止是一个无辜之人的意外死亡，里面有更重要的意义——



💧**Clue 2**: Gatsby's death is of significant meaning.



**Evidence 1**: If that was true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream.

如果是这样的话，他一定会觉得他已经失去了那个旧日的温暖的世界，为了抱着一个梦太久而付出了很高的代价。

Nick猜想可能Gatsby已经预感到Daisy不会来电话了。那个完全浪漫并且充满希望的世界正在幻灭，而他面临的新世界则是残酷而冰冷的（A new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about）.

从这个角度看，Gatsby的死反而是他个人的一种解脱：因为他不再受限在那个不切实际的幻梦里，他不需要再为了不会实现的理想而狂热、却又得不到任何回报。



**Evidence 2**: It was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener saw Wilson’s body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was complete.

我们抬起盖茨比朝着屋子里走以后，园丁才在不远的草丛里看见了威尔逊的尸体，于是这场大屠杀就结束了。

holocaust在这里是夸张（hyperbole）的说法。虽然三个人的死亡在规模上不足以称之为“大屠杀”，但它们都象征着“美国梦”的破灭和失败，Gatsby, Wilson以及Myrtle都是这一场幻梦的牺牲者。尤其Gatsby的死也是一个重要的转折点：Wilson的仇恨得到了解决，并且Wilson最终也结束了自己的生命，完成赎罪。

至此故事的矛盾已经基本全部解决，唯一剩下的悬念就是Tom, Daisy以及Jordan这一行人会在得知Gatsby的死后做出什么样的反应和行动。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧deep的俚语表达**

原文：“She’s a deep one,” said Wilson, as if that answered the question. “Ah-h-h ——”

"她这人捉摸不透。"威尔逊说，仿佛这就回答了问题。"啊--哟--哟--"

deep可以形容人“深不可测、难以捉摸的”。比如：Henry has always been a deep one . He keeps his views to himself. （亨利总是深藏不露，不会说出自己的观点。）

除此以外，deep由“深”这个含义还引申出了不少隐喻的用法~

\1. Beauty is only skin deep.

外在美是肤浅的

这个表达非常的直观生动，skin deep也就是“只停留在表面”。这句话可以形容“外表美丽不代表内在也如此”（a person who looks beautiful may not have a pleasing personality）.

它的来源是一位叫作Sir Thomas Overbury的诗人，他在自己的诗作《一位妻子》（“A Wife”）中写道：All the carnal beauty of my wife is but skin-deep.（我妻子的肉体美貌只是虚有其表。）

例句：My mother always used to say that beauty is only skin-deep. What’s really important is the sort of person you are.

\2. In deep water(s)

陷入困境/麻烦

这里的deep water是双关，其实就是指“麻烦、困境”（in difficult or dangerous situation）. 这个表达源自《圣经》（诗篇69:14）: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters（求你使我脱离那些恨我的人，使我出离深水）。

例句：Bill got in deep water in algebra class. The class is too difficult for him, and he's almost failing.



\3. Deep down inside

内心深处



这个表达其实就相当于at the bottom of one's heart. 一般用来形容一个人的本性或是内心深处的想法是怎么样的，但要注意不能用deeply来替换哦~ 比如：She can seem stern, but deep down she’s a very kind person.（她看上去可能严厉，其实心地非常善良。）这句话不能说成but deeply she's a very kind person.



例句：I tried to put on a brave face after the breakup, but deep down inside I was in agony.

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/c8ad27fe7b2b3b46497c18bfe71c006c-sz_1215971.jpg?x-oss-process=image/resize,w_1080/auto-orient,1/format,jpg/crop,x_61,y_121,w_933,h_341)



\4. Deep-six

抛弃，毁掉



这个表达源自它的名词形式deep six, 表示“海葬”（burial at sea）. 海葬有一定的条件要求，其中之一就是水深要达到six fathoms（六英寻，大概是10.8米）.



另一种解释是deep six表示six feet（六英尺，被认为是棺木一般的深度），比如six feet under就是委婉表示“逝世入土”（dead and buried）的一种方式。



两种解释都和“死亡”相关，所以deep-six引申为动词就是to kill, 即“抛弃，处理掉”（to eliminate or to dispose of of）的意思。



例句：The studio decided to deep-six the film after its budget began getting out of hand.

**After two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and the next day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers and newspaper men in and out of Gatsby’s front door.**

**A rope stretched across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard, and there were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the pool.**

**Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the expression “madman” as he bent over Wilson’s body that afternoon, and the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper reports next morning.**

**He fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying to take it from the bed, and lay down stiffly — was instantly asleep.**

**That night an obviously frightened person called up, and demanded to know who I was before he would give his name.**

**“This is Mr. Carraway,” I said.**

**“Oh!” He sounded relieved.**

**“This is Klipspringer.”**

**I was relieved too, for that seemed to promise another friend at Gatsby’s grave.**

**I didn’t want it to be in the papers and draw a sightseeing crowd, so I’d been calling up a few people myself.**

**They were hard to find.**

**“The funeral’s to-morrow,” I said.**

**“Three o’clock, here at the house. I wish you’d tell anybody who’d be interested.”**

**“Oh, I will,” he broke out hastily.**

**“Of course I’m not likely to see anybody, but if I do.”**

**His tone made me suspicious.**

**“Of course you’ll be there yourself.”**

**“Well, I’ll certainly try. What I called up about is ——”**

**“Wait a minute,” I interrupted.**

**“How about saying you’ll come?”**

**“Well, the fact is — the truth of the matter is that I’m staying with some people up here in Greenwich, and they rather expect me to be with them to-morrow.**

**In fact, there’s a sort of picnic or something.**

**Of course I’ll do my very best to getaway.”**

**I ejaculated an unrestrained “Huh!” and he must have heard me, for he went on nervously:**

**I didn’t hear the rest of the name, because I hung up the receiver.**

**After that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby — one gentleman to whom I telephoned implied that he had got what he deserved.**

### 背景知识

**💧James J. Hill**

“If he’d of lived, he’d of been a great man. A man like James J. Hill. He’d of helped build up the country.”（"假使他活下去的话，他会成为一个大人物的，像詹姆斯·J·希尔那样的人，他会帮助建设国家的。" ）

James J. Hill（1838-1916）是一位加拿大裔美国铁路建筑家、金融家（a Canadian-American railroad executive and financier）. 他的传奇之处在于：他通过自筹资金修建了洲际铁路——大北方铁路。在没有任何政府补贴，甚至没有公共土地通行权的情况下，Hill修好了大北方铁路。他本人对此非常自豪。此外，他还花钱为自己的铁路买下了通行权，连印第安土地的通行权都买下来了。

但James J. Hill并不是出身贵族的大亨。他的父亲在他十四岁的时候去世，他因而辍学去杂货店打工，并用每个月四美元的收入来帮助他的寡母和兄弟姐妹。年轻的时候，他在农场、航运、轮船、皮毛贸易和铁路公司工作过。在这样的环境中，他学会了经商之道，存下了资金并最终成为了他自己企业的投资者和管理者。

James J. Hill还被人们称作是The Empire Builder（“帝国建设者”），为了纪念他的贡献，从芝加哥到太平洋西北岸（from Chicago to the Pacific Northwest）有一趟专线列车就叫作Empire Builder.

这里Gatsby的父亲把James J. Hill和自己的儿子相比，可以说是充满了自豪之情的。因为他的儿子也是在贫寒的家庭环境中靠自己的努力发家致富的。

### 课文理解

Gatsby的意外死亡无疑造成了一场不小的轰动，但大家都不是真正为了Gatsby而惋惜哀悼，只是出于各种利己的目的消费着他的财富和名声——

💧**Clue 1**: People only intend to take advantages of Gatsby.

**Evidence 1**:  Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the expression “madman” as he bent over Wilson’s body that afternoon, and the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper reports next morning.

那天下午，有一个神态自信的人，也许是一名侦探，低头检视威尔逊的尸体时用了"疯子"两个字，由于他的语气颇显权威，第二天早上的报纸便以此为基调作了报道。

八卦报刊从来只在乎制造话题和噱头，在文中还有一处体现了Nick对他们的鄙夷和厌恶：...the whole tale would shortly be served up in racy pasquinade（只要Myrtle的妹妹Catherine稍微透露了一些关于姐姐的风流韵事，报刊就会对此大加渲染，写成低俗的文章）。

其实不仅是公众媒体的态度如此，那些曾经在Gatsby的豪华盛宴上放纵享乐的人有更虚伪可鄙的一面。

**Evidence 2**: After that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby — one gentleman to whom I telephoned implied that he had got what he deserved.

在那以后我为盖茨比感到羞愧——还有一个我打电话去找的人竟然表示他是死有应得的。

当然也还有在Gatsby的派对上喝得烂醉然后对他大肆谩骂的（who used to sneer most bitterly at Gatsby on the courage of Gatsby’s liquor）. 以及曾经在Gatsby家借住的一个房客，在Chapter 5.3中出现过：It was Mr. Klipspringer, the “boarder.” I had seen him wandering hungrily about the beach that morning.

Nick接到他主动打来的电话时，错认为他是表示吊唁并且要参加葬礼的：



**Evidence 3**:  “What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there. I wonder if it’d be too much trouble to have the butler send them on. You see, they’re tennis shoes, and I’m sort of helpless without them. My address is care of B. F. ——”

"我打电话来是为了我留在那里的一双鞋。不知道能不能麻烦你让男管家给我寄来，你知道，那是双网球鞋，我离了它简直没办法。我的地址是B·F……"

Nick起初非常宽慰（“I was relieved too, for that seemed to promise another friend at Gatsby’s grave.”）但对方支支吾吾了一段后，他才表明自己的真正目的是要拿回落在Gatsby这的一双网球鞋。当然气愤不已的Nick挂断了电话。

在所有人的冷漠和势利之外，唯一意外的温暖来自Gatsby的父亲，他也是除了Nick之外唯一在乎关心Gatsby的人——



💧**Clue 2**: Gatsby's father is the other one who cares for Gatsby.



**Evidence 1**: I think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C. Gatz arrived from a town in Minnesota. It said only that the sender was leaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came.

我想大概是第三天，从明尼苏达州的一个小城镇来了一封署名亨利·C·盖兹的电报。上面只说发电人马上动身，要求等他到达后再举行葬礼。

Gatsby的父亲在报纸上看到消息后便马上动身了（“I saw it in the Chicago newspaper,” he said. “It was all in the Chicago newspaper. I started right away.”）而且他明显受到了很大的震颤，整个人也几乎处于崩溃边缘（He was on the point of collapse...But he wouldn’t eat, and the glass of milk spilled from his trembling hand）.

还有一个小细节也是令人感觉意外的，当Nick提出要不要把Gatsby的遗体运回西部老家的时候，这位父亲回答道：



**Evidence 2**: “— Mr. Gatz. I thought you might want to take the body West.” He shook his head. “Jimmy always liked it better down East. He rose up to his position in the East. Were you a friend of my boy’s, Mr. —?”

"盖兹先生，我以为您也许要把遗体运到西部去。" 他摇了摇头。 "杰米一向喜欢待在东部。他是在东部上升到他这个地位的。你是我孩子的朋友吗，先生？"



他并没有对Gatsby离开家感到愤怒，相反地，他非常理解认同，而且他对Gatsby也有一种强烈的自豪感（“If he’d of lived, he’d of been a great man. A man like James J. Hill. He’d of helped build up the country”）.

在明天的内容里，我们也会通过Gatsby父亲的视角看到关于Gatsby的另一面，以及还会有Gatsby的熟识在葬礼上出现。但对于Tom和Daisy的突然消失（I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her instinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away early that afternoon, and taken baggage with them）, Nick似乎有意延宕了这个悬念的解决，也没有暗示他们是否会再次出现，作为读者也只好屏息以待了~

### 今日彩蛋

**💧扒一扒大衣都有哪些款式**

It was Gatsby’s father, a solemn old man, very helpless and dismayed, bundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day.（来的是盖茨比的父亲，一个很庄重的老头子，非常可怜，非常沮丧，这样暖和的九月天就裹上了一件蹩脚的长外套。）

Gatsby的父亲今天一登场就穿了一件叫作ulster样式的廉价大衣，在Nick看来，天气这么暖和的九月就穿上大衣实在是很蹩脚笨拙。那么ulster究竟是什么样的呢？今天的彩蛋我们就来扒一扒大衣的各种款式~

1.Ulster Coat

阿尔斯特宽大衣

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/6d4154af1f243723f539427f27694dfb-sz_160401.jpeg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



阿尔斯特宽大衣最开始是维多利亚时期人们白天工作时穿的大衣，有袖子也有披风（a Victorian working daytime overcoat, with a cape and sleeves）, 因此都用耐磨的粗纤维像常见的人字呢和粗花呢等制成。

最原始的Ulster Coat是如左图中那样有可拆斗篷披肩、隐藏式单排扣，后来便演变成右图这般，腰带（可有可无）、六颗双排扣、袖口拼接，最标志性的非这个大大的领口莫属，又被统称为Ulster collar.

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/11854ada02d642ad60d48679528302c0-sz_57563.jpeg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



\2. Chesterfield Coat 查彻斯特大衣

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/b68a5550102dcf7e79c42e3eaa1505f8-sz_130395.jpeg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



这款大衣算是大家最常买、最常见、最经典的了。它最早出现在19世纪中期，名字是由英国Chesterfield庄园的第六任伯爵George Stanhope所命名，在维多利亚时代末期开始流行。而虽然设计上是男士款式，但在19世纪便在女性当中流行开来了。

Chesterfield Coat一般是及膝长（knee-length）, 剪裁和西装相近，还有天鹅绒的领子（velvet collar）.

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/e2cf199ebbcd344981139051f86dfa95-sz_240703.jpeg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



\3. Trench Coat 战壕大衣

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/68cd28f2748767c2b12c0f5400cd4c58-sz_134678.jpeg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



这款大衣一般被称作风衣或是Burberry Coat, 但其实它的专业名字是Trench Coat, 而且和Chesterfield Coat一样，背后也有一段故事。

这是Burberry本人为第一次世界大战所设计的军官雨衣，所以Trench Coat这个名字实际取自Trench Warfare（trench指“战壕”，一种作战的辅助工具，交战方处于对峙时，掘土成壕，可以防止从正面袭击过来的子弹和炮弹）。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/48f8f86e13a9c02a8b25faea2f234ab4-sz_98841.jpeg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



从它的机能性和细节上就可以看出是为了备战而设计的。比如它除了能够防风防水，还有为了军阶考虑而设计的肩带。并且考虑到用枪的频繁，右肩上多了一层补强以抵挡枪托；而背部标志性的翻盖设计则是为了挡雨。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/af551c8ed3fad2ac2d101a816bf031a4-sz_100828.jpeg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



腰部配有和大衣材料一致的腰带，据说这是因为减少扣带的麻烦，可以直接绑着。同样在袖口会有束带防止雨水渗入，腰部前后都配有D环以便悬挂手枪背带或手榴弹等。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/03c8ea1f2939a46baa3b0a8f0739f83d-sz_99189.jpeg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



\4. Polo Coat 马球大衣

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/97cd6fa8925f2f751b80c80e6251c3ec-sz_163076.jpeg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



这件大衣可谓是国家领导人们最爱穿的大衣之一。Polo即马球，这款大衣的由来完全是因为五十年代英国的著名马球手Tommy Hitchcock在梅道布鲁克跑马场候场时身上穿的保暖大衣。虽然Polo Coat起源于英国，但当时却在美国流行开来。



面料上最开始是只用驼绒（camelhair）, 后来则主要采用驼绒和羊毛混织而成（blended with wool）. 所以Camel Coat和Polo Coat其实都是指同一种大衣款式。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/d883968a0ce4912d9ef3e7eb332ba371-sz_247073.jpeg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



\5. Crombie Coat 克龙比式大衣 

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/0236aabda4ae3713f0d6fab73950b3ea-sz_74376.jpeg?x-oss-process=image/resize,w_1080/auto-orient,1/crop,x_199,y_0,w_679,h_999)



传统上讲，Crombie Coat外套指的就是是英国品牌Crombie的外套，随着时间的推移，这个名字已经包含了基本上所有类似于这种四分之三长度外套设计的衣服。



这款大衣既适用于晚宴，也可以作为平时的休闲外套。它起源于19世纪末，在常年阴雨绵绵的英国，这种质感厚重的由羊毛材质制作而成大衣自然成为英国绅士们保暖造型的一大帮手了。

## **Chapter 9.2**

**The morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer Wolfsheim; I couldn’t seem to reach him any other way.**

**The door that I pushed open, on the advice of an elevator boy, was marked “The Swastika Holding Company,” and at first there didn’t seem to be any one inside.**

**But when I’d shouted “hello” several times in vain, an argument broke out behind a partition, and presently a lovely Jewess appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile eyes.**

**“Nobody’s in,” she said.**

**“Mr. Wolfsheim’s gone to Chicago.”**

**The first part of this was obviously untrue, for someone had begun to whistle “The Rosary,” tunelessly, inside.**

> ==tunelessly英['tju:nlisli] 美['tunləsli] adv. 不入调地；不悦耳地==

**“Please say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him.”**

**“I can’t get him back from Chicago, can I?”**

**At this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfsheim’s, called “Stella!” from the other side of the door.**

**“Leave your name on the desk,” she said quickly.**

**“I’ll give it to him when he gets back.”**

**“But I know he’s there.”**

**She took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up and down her hips.**

> ==indignantly英 [in'dignəntli] 美 [ɪnˈdɪɡnəntlɪ] adv. 愤怒地；愤慨地==

**“You young men think you can force your way in here any time,” she scolded.**

**“We’re getting sickantired of it. When I say he’s in Chicago, he’s in Chicago.”**

**I mentioned Gatsby.**

**“Oh — h!” She looked at me over again.**

**“Will you just — What was your name?”**

**She vanished.**

**In a moment Meyer Wolfsheim stood solemnly in the doorway, holding out both hands.**

**He drew me into his office, remarking in a reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us, and offered me a cigar.**

> ==reverent==
>
> adj. 恭敬的，虔敬的

**“My memory goes back to when I first met him,” he said.**

**“A young major just out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war.**

**He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he couldn’t buy some regular clothes.**

**First time I saw him was when he come into Winebrenner’s poolroom at Forty-third Street and asked for a job.**

**He hadn’t eat anything for a couple of days.**

**‘come on have some lunch with me,’ I sid.**

**He ate more than four dollars’ worth of food in half an hour.”**

**“Did you start him in business?” I inquired.**

**“Start him! I made him.” “Oh.”**

**“I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter.**

> <font color=red>“I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter.”</font>
>

**I saw right away he was a fine-appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told me he was at Oggsford I knew I could use him good.**

**I got him to join up in the American Legion and he used to stand high there.**

**Right off he did some work for a client of mine up to Albany.**

**We were so thick like that in everything.”— he held up two bulbous fingers ——” always together.”**

**I wondered if this partnership had included the World’s Series transaction in 1919.**

**“Now he’s dead,” I said after a moment.**

**“You were his closest friend, so I know you’ll want to come to his funeral this afternoon.”**

**“I’d like to come.”**

**“Well, come then.”**

**The hair in his nostrils quivered slightly, and as he shook his head his eyes filled with tears.**

**“I can’t do it — I can’t get mixed up in it,” he said.**

**“There’s nothing to get mixed up in. It’s all over now.”**

**“When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any way. I keep out.**

**When I was a young man it was different — if a friend of mine died, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end.**

**You may think that’s sentimental, but I mean it — to the bitter end.”**

>
> ②to the bitter end “坚持到底，拼到底”；bitter指“艰苦的”，所以这个短语表示不论多难都会坚持（continuing until the end, even though this is difficult）, 比如：Employees have vowed to fight the closure to the bitter end.
>
> 雇员们誓死抗争到底，坚决抵制关闭企业。

**I saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come, so I stood up.**

**“Are you a college man?” he inquired suddenly.**

**For a moment I thought he was going to suggest a “gonnegtion,” but he only nodded and shook my hand.**

**“Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead,” he suggested.**

**“After that my own rule is to let everything alone.”**

**When I left his office the sky had turned dark and I got back to West Egg in a drizzle.**

**After changing my clothes I went next door and found Mr. Gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall.**

**His pride in his son and in his son’s possessions was continually increasing and now he had something to show me.**

**“Jimmy sent me this picture.” He took out his wallet with trembling fingers.**

**“Look there.”**

**It was a photograph of the house, cracked in the corners and dirty with many hands.**

**He pointed out every detail to me eagerly.**

**“Look there!” and then sought admiration from my eyes.**

**He had shown it so often that I think it was more real to him now than the house itself.**

**“Jimmy sent it to me. I think it’s a very pretty picture. It shows up well.”**

**“Very well. Had you seen him lately?”**

**“He come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house I live in now.**

**Of course we was broke up when he run off from home, but I see now there was a reason for it.**

**He knew he had a big future in front of him.**

**And ever since he made a success he was very generous with me.”**

**He seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held it for another minute, lingeringly, before my eyes.**

**Then he returned the wallet and pulled from his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called Hopalong Cassidy.**

> ==ragged英 ['rægɪd] 美 [ˈræɡɪd] adj. 衣衫褴褛的；粗糙的；参差不齐的；锯齿状的；刺耳的；不规则的==

**“Look here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It just shows you.”**

**He opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see.**

**On the last fly-leaf was printed the word Schedule, and the date September 12, 1906, and underneath:**

**Rise from bed. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .6.00 a.m.**

**Dumbbell exercise and wall-scaling. . . . .. 6.15-6.30**

**Study electricity, etc. . . . . . . . . . . .7.15-8.15**

**Do you notice what he’s got about improving his mind?**

**He was always great for that.**

**He told me I et like a hog once, and I beat him for it.”**

**He was reluctant to close the book, reading each item aloud and then looking eagerly at me.**

**I think he rather expected me to copy down the list for my own use.**

**A little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing, and I began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars.**

**So did Gatsby’s father.**

**And as the time passed and the servants came in and stood waiting in the hall, his eyes began to blink anxiously, and he spoke of the rain in a worried, uncertain way.**

**The minister glanced several times at his watch, so I took him aside and asked him to wait for half an hour.**

**But it wasn’t any use. Nobody came.**

**About five o’clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate —**

**first a motor hearse, horribly black and wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and I in the limousine, and a little later four or five servants and the postman from West Egg in Gatsby’s station wagon, all wet to the skin.**

**As we started through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then the sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground.**

**I looked around.**

**It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found marvelling over Gatsby’s books in the library one night three months before.**

**I’d never seen him since then.**

**I don’t know how he knew about the funeral, or even his name.**

**The rain poured down his thick glasses, and he took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled from Gatsby’s grave.**

**I tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment, but he was already too far away, and I could only remember, without resentment, that Daisy hadn’t sent a message or a flower.**

**Dimly I heard someone murmur, “Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on,” and then the owl-eyed man said “Amen to that,” in a brave voice.**

### 背景知识

**💧1. The Swastika Holding Company** 

The door that I pushed open, on the advice of an elevator boy, was marked “The Swastika Holding Company”...

Nick亲自来到纽约拜访Meyer Wolfsheim, 在推门而入之前就看到了门上写着公司的名称：The Swastika Holding Company.

Holding Company是指“控股公司”，也就是一个有限公司去拥有另外一个有限公司的股份。建立控股公司的目的并不是要用来运作一个生意，而只是用来持股的。比如如果你已经有一个有限公司在营运你的生意，那么设立一个Holding Company有可能为你带来延税或免税。

Swastika来自于梵文，由Su（吉祥）和Asati（有）两字合成，寓意吉祥，一般以这个符号出现：卍（音“万”）。它最早是古代印欧的宗教符号象征（an ancient Indo-European religious symbol），发源地就是乌克兰（Ukraine）. 从一万多年前开始，各个宗教包括佛教、婆罗门教、耆那教都把这个作为神圣以及吉祥的标志使用（used a sacred and auspicious symbol in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism and dates back at least 11,000 years）.

在美国，人们一般会把这个符号和古老的异域文明联系在一起，而且将其视作“神秘主义”（mysticism）以及“预言算命”（fortune telling）的象征。Fitzegerald这样命名Wolfsheim的公司也是为了给他的人物形象增添一层神秘的背景（比如前文还描写到Wolfsheim佩戴的袖口是用真人臼齿做的：“I see you’re looking at my cuff buttons”）.



**💧2. The Rosary**

原文：The first part of this was obviously untrue, for someone had begun to whistle “The Rosary,” tunelessly, inside.

Nick在门口听到有人在用口哨吹奏The Rosary, 于是笃定Wolfsheim就在里面。

The Rosary全称为The Holy Rosary, 即《玫瑰经》（正式名称为《圣母圣咏》），于十五世纪由圣座正式颁布，是天主教徒用于敬礼圣母玛利亚的祷文（a form of prayer used in the Catholic Church）. “玫瑰经”一词来源于拉丁语“Rosarium”，意为“玫瑰花冠”或“一束玫瑰”。

此名是比喻连串的祷文如玫瑰馨香，敬献于天主与圣母身前。玫瑰经是天主教敬礼圣母的一种方式，其中也涵盖了耶稣的救恩史。



**💧3. Station wagon**

...and a little later four or five servants and the postman from West Egg in Gatsby’s station wagon...

坐在Gatsby的station wagon里的有四五个仆人，还有西卵的邮差。

station wagon一般译为“旅行车”，也可以叫作estate car, estate or wagon. 这种车型得名于它的用途，它最初是作为乘客往返乡间宅邸和附近火车站的通勤工具（to transport people and luggage between a country estate and the nearest train station）.

第一辆station wagon是1910年在美国生产的，由专门为福特汽车制作木制底盘的独立制造商生产（by independent manufacturers producing wooden custom bodies for the Ford Model T chassis）. 到了1930年代，美国、英国以及法国的汽车制造商都开始大量生产这款汽车。

但是在小型货车（minivan）和SUV（sport-utilityvehicle, “运动型多用途车”）越来越普及后（increasing in popularity），大家就不怎么愿意买station wagon了。

### 课文理解

自从Wolfsheim在电话里委婉地表示了自己没办法参加Gatsby的葬礼后，Nick便决定在Gatsby出殡的那一天亲自到纽约去找他。Wolfsheim的态度依然婉转但又冷淡坚决，而且他一直认为自己是Gatsby的“恩人”，自己所做的已经是仁至义尽了。Wolfsheim自始至终的回避态度可以从他的言辞表达里看出来——

💧**Clue 1**:  Wolfsheim has never given thought to get involved in Gatsby's stuff, including his funeral.

**Evidence 1**:  If there is anything I can do a little later let me know in a letter by Edgar. I hardly know where I am when I hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and out.

过一些时候如有我可以出力的事，请派埃德加送封信通知我。我听到这种事后简直不知道自己身在何处，感到天昏地暗了。

这一段是Wolfsheim早先给Nick的回信中结尾的部分，“let me know in a letter”以及说自己“completely knocked down and out”其实都是委婉拒绝的表达方式。Wolfsheim明显在刻意回避再和Gatsby的事扯上关系。



**Evidence 2**: “Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead,” he suggested. “After that my own rule is to let everything alone.”

"咱们大家都应当学会在朋友活着的时候讲交情，而不要等到他死了之后，"他表示说，"在人死以后，我个人的原则是不管闲事。"

当Nick上门找他的时候，Wolfsheim的态度则高傲冷漠的多。他认为自己已经在Gatsby生前对他仁至义尽了：比如他一直强调是自己把Gatsby“从阴沟里拉出来”（out of the gutter）, 而且Gatsby能有今天都是他一手培养出来的（“Start him! I made him”）. 但不可否认的是，他也“利用”了Gatsby来给自己干非法的勾当：



**Evidence 3**:  Right off he did some work for a client of mine up to Albany. We were so thick like that in everything.”— he held up two bulbous fingers ——” always together.”

I wondered if this partnership had included the World’s Series transaction in 1919.

他一出马就跑到奥尔巴尼（纽约州首府）去给我的一个主顾办了一件事。我们俩在一切方面都像这样亲密，"他举起了两个肥胖的指头，"永远在一起。"

我心里很纳罕，不知这种搭档是否也包括1919年世界棒球联赛那笔交易在内。

Nick明白Wolfsheim是打定主意不会参加葬礼的，于是回到了西卵。Gatsby的父亲给Nick展示了Gatsby少年的时候看的一本书，并且在书的尾页还有一张Gatsby自己制定的作息表，这也让我们看到Gatsby的确自小就大有抱负，而且意志力惊人——



💧**Clue 2**: The secret of Gatsby's success — resolution and diligence.



**Evidence 1**: “Jimmy was bound to get ahead. He always had some resolves like this or something. Do you notice what he’s got about improving his mind? He was always great for that.”

"杰米是注定了要出人头地的，他总是订出一些诸如此类的决心。你注意没有，他用什么办法提高自己的思想？他在这方面一向是了不起的。"

Gatsby在时间表里不仅列出了包括Dumbbell exercise and wall-scaling（“哑铃体操”）、Study electricity, etc.（“学习电学”）以及Practice elocution, poise and how to attain it （“练习演说、仪态”）等内容，还有各种决心，比如：No more smoking or chewing（“不再吸烟或嚼烟”）、Be better to parents（“对父母更加体贴”）等。

可以看出Gatsby对自己设置了非常高的期待，而且他想成为的不仅是有钱人，更是德才兼备的“完人”（a well-rounded man）, 也正是这一点让Nick对他充满了敬意。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧Comforting death quotes to live by**

今天的内容里，Gatsby的葬礼在雨中简陋地举行完毕，为整个故事的结尾留下了黯淡又哀伤的一笔。

关于死亡，鲁迅先生有一句名言：“过去的生命已经死亡。我对于这死亡有大欢喜，因为我借此知道它曾经存活。”其实除了恐惧和悲伤，死亡更多时候是让我们从另一个角度思考什么是生命。

今天的彩蛋为大家准备了一些关于死亡的格言，希望它们给你带去安慰的同时，也能启发你对于生命的思考。

The reason that you call it 'grief' is because you've been programmed to believe that you should feel bad about death.

— Abraham-Hicks

你所称之为“悲痛”的情绪，只不过是你认为自己必须要因为死亡而感觉难受所产生的。



What the caterpillar calls the end of the world, the master calls a butterfly.

— Richard Bach 

毛毛虫的死亡，是蝴蝶的诞生。



When I stand before God at the end of my life, I would hope that I would not have a single bit of talent left and could say, "I used everything you gave me."

— Erma Bombeck

当生命结束我站在上帝面前的时候，我希望我的才能一点都不剩下，这样我就可以说：“我用完了你给我的一切。”



Loss leaves us empty - but learn not to close your heart and mind in grief. Allow life to replenish you. When sorrow comes it seems impossible, but new joys wait to fill the void.

— Pam Brown

失去让我们感觉空虚，但不要关闭自己的心灵而沉浸在悲伤中。让生活填补你的空虚，虽然这在悲伤来临的时候似乎是不可能的，但新的喜悦其实就在等着把你的缺口填满。



Our death is not an end if we can live on in our children and the younger generation. For they are us, our bodies are only wilted leaves on the tree of life.

— Albert Einstein 

如果我们的生命可以在我们的孩子和后代身上延续，那么我们的死亡就不是一个结束。他们就是我们，我们的身体只不过是生命之树上枯萎的叶子。



Our fear of death is like our fear that summer will be short. But when we have had our swing of pleasure, our fill of fruit, and our swelter of heat, we say, we have had our day.

— Ralph Waldo Emerson

我们害怕死亡，就像害怕夏天会太短暂一样。但当我们玩得尽兴了，或是尝够了鲜美的果实，以及一通酣畅淋漓后，我们就会说，这一天美满了。



**Chapter 9.3**

**When we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow, began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and the dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild brace came suddenly into the air.**

**We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware of our identity with this country for one strange hour, before we melted indistinguishably into it again.**

> <font color=red>We drew in deep breaths of it / as we walked back from dinner / through the cold vestibules, /unutterably aware of our identity with this country/ for one strange hour, / before we melted indistinguishably into it again.</font>

> 我们吃过晚饭穿过寒冷的通廊往回走时，一路深深地呼吸着这寒气，在奇异的一个小时中难以言喻地意识到自己与这片乡土之间的血肉相连的关系，然后我们就要重新不留痕迹地融化在其中了。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①drew in deep breaths of it “深深地呼吸着这寒气”（it指上文的the aire）；draw in指“吸入”；breath形容“一口/股（空气）”时是可数名词，deep breaths就是“好几口深呼吸”；
>
> ②vestibule 指“〔连接火车前后车厢的〕通廊，连廊”（the space at each end of a railway carriage that connects it with the next carriage）.
>
> ③unutterably aware of our identity with this country “难以言喻地意识到自己与这片乡土之间的血肉相连的关系”；unutterably即unspeakably, “难以言说地”；identity with sth表示“和某物的相似性，一致性”（similarity），尤指因此而产生的“身份认同感”，比如：Our strong sense of national identity has been shaped by our history.
>
> 我们的历史使我们形成了强烈的民族认同感。
>
> ④melted indistinguishably into it “不留痕迹地融化在其中”；indistinguishably即unrecognizably; melt into表示“融入”，比如：He is trying to melt into the background.
>
> 他试图让自己消失在背景里。
>
> *这句话依旧是Nick在回忆每逢坐火车从东部回西部过圣诞节的时候，在短短一个小时的车程里，他开始认识到自己和这片土地的联系，由此对家乡产生了更强的归属感。

**That’s my Middle West — not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede towns, but the thrilling returning trains of my youth, and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of hollywreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow.**

> <font color=red>That’s my Middle West — / not the wheat / or the prairies / or the lost Swede towns, / but the thrilling returning trains of my youth, / and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark / and the shadows of holly wreaths / thrown by lighted windows / on the snow.</font>
>
> 这就是我的中西部——不是麦田，不是草原，也不是瑞典移民的荒凉村镇，而是我青年时代那些激动人心的还乡的火车，是严寒的黑夜里的街灯和雪橇的铃声，是灯火辉映的窗户映在雪地的冬青花环的影子。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①the thrilling returning trains of my youth “青年时代那些激动人心的还乡的火车”；thrilling指“激动人心的”（exciting）, 虽然修饰的是trains, 但这里是指Nick自己感觉很兴奋，这种手法叫作“移就”（hypallage）, 在这里是“移人于物”。
>
> ②the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow 可以还原为正常语序来理解：lighted windows throw the shadows of holly wreaths on the snow. “灯火辉映的窗户映在雪地的冬青花环的影子”；一般我们说某物投射下影子用到的表达就是sth cast/throw a shadow on/over, 比如： An oak tree cast its shadow over a tiny round pool. 
>
>  一棵橡树在一个小圆池塘上投下了它的影子。
>
> *wheat（小麦）和prairie（草原）都是典型的中西部特征，而Swede towns即瑞典人移民美国中西部后聚居的地方；但对Nick来说，这些都不是让他感受最深刻的。

**I am part of that, a little solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent from growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are still called through decades by a family’s name.**

**I see now that this has been a story of the West, after all — Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.**

**Even when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware of its superiority to the bored,sprawling, swollen towns beyond the Ohio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the children and the very old — even then it had always for me a quality of distortion.**

> ==sprawling英 [ˈsprɔ:lɪŋ] 美 [ˈsprɔlɪŋ] adj. 蔓生的，不规则地伸展的==
>
> ==inquisition英 \[ɪŋkwɪ'zɪʃ(ə)n][ˌɪnkwɪˈzɪʃən, ˌɪŋ-] n. 调查；宗教法庭；审讯==

>
> 即使东部最令我兴奋的时候，即使我最敏锐地感觉到比之俄亥俄河那边的那些沉闷、凌乱、浮夸的城镇，那些只有儿童和老人可幸免于无止无休的闲话的城镇，东部具有无比的优越性——即使在那种时候，我也总觉得东部给人一种扭曲的感觉。
>
> **💧句式拆解**
>
> 这句话的主体结构其实非常简单：Even when the East..., even when I..., even then it...（前面两个并列的时间状语从句都在强调主句的内容，也就是：it had always for me a quality of distoriton）.
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns “它（东部）比那些沉闷、凌乱、浮夸的城镇更具有优越性”；superiority to表示“对……具有优势，优越”，通常包含贬义；sprawling表示“杂乱延伸的”，比如a vast, sprawling city就是“无计划而盲目扩展的巨大城市”；swollen本义指“（身体）肿胀的”或“（河流）涨水的”，这里引申为“浮夸的”；
>
> ②with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the children and the very old “只有儿童和老人可幸免于无止无休的闲话”（their指前文的towns）; interminable表示“无止境的”（endless）; inquisition指“〔带威胁或令人不快的〕盘问，查问”（official investigation）, 并且一般是官方的（这里是讽刺的语气，把人们的八卦闲嘴比喻为“审讯”）；spare sb表示“使某人幸免于”，一般是免除痛苦、麻烦（spare sb the trouble/difficulty etc.）;
>
> ③it had always for me a quality of distortion “我也总觉得东部给人一种扭曲的感觉”；always for me也就是“对我来说总觉得……”，可以省略不看，剩下的部分就是it had a quality of distortion, “有某种扭曲的特质”，这里的distortion可以理解为东部在道德观念上是扭曲的，或者发生在那里的一切事情都不是真切现实的。

**West Egg, especially, still figures in my more fantastic dreams.**

**I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at once conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging sky and a lustreless moon.**

> 战争的危险笼罩着欧洲。

**In the foreground four solemn men in dress suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a drunken woman in a white evening dress.**

**Her hand, which dangles over the side, sparkles cold with jewels.**

**Gravely the men turn in at a house — the wrong house.**

**But no one knows the woman’s name, and no one cares.**

**After Gatsby’s death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted beyond my eyes’ power of correction.**

**So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line I decided to come back home.**

**There was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant thing that perhaps had better have been let alone.**

**But I wanted to leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent sea to sweep my refuse away.**

**I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and around what had happened to us together, and what had happened afterward to me, and she lay perfectly still, listening, in a big chair.**

**She was dressed to play golf, and I remember thinking she looked like a good illustration, her chin raised a little jauntily, her hair the color of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee.**

**When I had finished she told me without comment that she was engaged to another man.**

**I doubted that, though there were several she could have married at a nod of her head, but I pretended to be surprised.**

**For just a minute I wondered if I wasn’t making a mistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up to say good-bye.**

**“Nevertheless you did throw me over,” said Jordan suddenly.**

**“You threw me over on the telephone. I don’t give a damn about you now, but it was a new experience for me, and I felt a little dizzy for a while.”**

**We shook hands.**

**“Oh, and do you remember.”— she added ——” a conversation we had once about driving a car?”**

**“Why — not exactly.”**

**“You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver?**

**Well, I met another bad driver, didn’t I?**

**I mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess.**

**I thought you were rather an honest, straightforward person.**

**I thought it was your secret pride.”**

**“I’m thirty,” I said.**

**“I’m five years too old to lie to myself and call it honor.”**

**She didn’t answer.**

**Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously sorry, I turned away.**

**One afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan.**

**He was walking ahead of me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a little from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving sharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes.**

**Just as I slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into the windows of a jewelry store.**

**Suddenly he saw me and walked back, holding out his hand.**

**“What’s the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with me?”**

**“Yes. You know what I think of you.”**

**“You’re crazy, Nick,” he said quickly.**

**“Crazy as hell. I don’t know what’s the matter with you.”**

**“Tom,” I inquired, “what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?”**

**He stared at me without a word, and I knew I had guessed right about those missing hours.**

**I started to turn away, but he took a step after me and grabbed my arm.**

**“I told him the truth,” he said.**

**“He came to the door while we were getting ready to leave, and when I sent down word that we weren’t in he tried to force his way up-stairs.**

**He was crazy enough to kill me if I hadn’t told him who owned the car.**

**His hand was on a revolver in his pocket every minute he was in the house ——”**

**He broke off defiantly.**

**“What if I did tell him?**

**That fellow had it coming to him.**

**He threw dust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy’s, but he was a tough one.**

**He ran over Myrtle like you’d run over a dog and never even stopped his car.”**

**There was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that it wasn’t true.**

**“And if you think I didn’t have my share of suffering — look here, when I went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard, I sat down and cried like a baby. By God it was awful ——”**

**I couldn’t forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely justified.**

**It was all very careless and confused.**

**They were careless people, Tom and Daisy — they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made. . .**

### 背景知识

**💧The development of Middle West in America**

当初因为倍感中西部的荒凉萧条而离开的Nick，来到纽约经历了一番人性现实的虚情寡义后，深感厌恶。于是，带着对故乡的真实质朴燃起的亲切感，他决定离开喧嚣冷漠的大都市，回到中西部。

那么让Nick最后心心念念的中西部，有着什么样的发展历史呢？

首先，“中西部”一词起源于十九世纪，中西部的中心区域被五大湖地区、俄亥俄河和密西西比河谷所包围，旧西北部（或称西部）指的则是原来的西北领地，目前旧定义的中西部被美国人口调查局称作中北部东方，而被当地居民称为五大湖区（the Great Lakes region）.

除原住民外，中西部还汇聚了大批的欧洲移民。这片地区最初是由十七世纪的法国拓荒活动（French exploration）、建立毛皮交易（fur trade）网路以及传教活动而开始开垦，而英国移民在1750年代时则开始在俄亥俄地区拓展殖民势力。在美国独立战争的结束后，还有大量独立战争时期的退伍军人和来自东部各州的拓荒者开始移居在此。而到了美国南北战争时期，移居美洲大陆的欧洲移民通常会绕过当时东岸地区的美国直接定居在美洲大陆内陆地区。

由于中西部地区的肥沃土壤，这一地区盛产包括玉米、燕麦及小麦的各种谷物，其中以小麦最为重要，因此早期中西部也被称为美国的“面包篮”（Breadbasket）.

另外，水路（waterway）也是中西部地区发展最重要的因素之一，而且中西部的河流也是促成马克吐温笔下两本经典名著—《密西西比河上的生活》（*Life on the Mississippi*）及《顽童历险记》（*Adventures of Huckleberry Finn*）—的灵感来源。

在文化上，中西部居民常被认为是个性开放、友善且坦率，但有时候会给他人造成憨直且固执的成见。中西部价值观成形的因素可能是自废奴主义者、重视教育的公理会会众、中西部新教徒的卡尔文主义的宗教传统，以及勤劳的早期开拓先驱者培植的重农价值观。

今日，美国东西两岸的富裕生活和南方阳光地带的快速成长使人觉得中西部的生活不易。中西部的许多工厂被废弃，移往南部或海外，使得有些人把工业化的中西叫做生锈地带。

### 课文理解

在描述完Gatsby葬礼的情形后，Nick突然闪回到了自己在读预备学校乃至大学的时候，每逢圣诞节大家都会坐上火车回家。紧接着在火车上的这一段描写，既是Nick的回忆，也是他最后离开长岛回中西部的心境反映。那么到底是什么让Nick最后决定离开纽约长岛的呢？又或者说中西部有什么特质吸引着Nick？

首先，中西部是一个更有人情味的地方；而且，这里和繁荣但道德堕落的东部不同，很多传统的信条都在这里得到了存留，所以某种层面上来说，中西部给了Nick更多的温暖踏实感——



💧**Clue 1**:  Middle West is of more human touch and moral order.



**Evidence 1**:  I am part of that, a little solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent from growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are still called through decades by a family’s name.

我是其中的一部分，由于那些漫长的冬天我为人不免有点矜持，由于从小在卡罗威公馆长大，态度上也不免有点自满。在我们那个城市里，人家的住宅仍旧世世代代称为某姓的公馆。

在中西部Nick有了归属感，首先因为他也是出身于有一定地位的人家，所以在脸面上自然有光彩；其次是因为中西部依然还保留有很多传统的文化和信条，虽然这些一开始在Nick看来可能是死气沉沉而无趣的，但在经历了一番东部的纸醉金迷后，他又重新发现了中西部的质朴和诚实。



**Evidence 2**: After Gatsby’s death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted beyond my eyes’ power of correction.

盖茨比死后，东部在我心目中就是这样如鬼魅一般，面目全非到超过了我视力矫正的范围。

东部在Nick眼里已然变成一派鬼影幢幢的样子，而且一切的扭曲程度已经超过了他所能“矫正”的范围。这里有两层意思，首先是东部已经失去了道德中心，人们对于金钱和物质的观念都是扭曲的；其次是Nick在东部经历了一场真实的梦想的幻灭，这让他看到现实并不是牢靠的，而且所谓的真相往往都是对实际的扭曲（比如上流社会的八卦闲谈等）。

最后要提到的是，其实我们每个人身上都有Gatsby影子。拿他的故事为什么能吸引人来举例，因为我们都会想追求梦想、追求成功，而且也是因为我们都羡慕这种白手起家、麻雀变凤凰的情节，并且相信有一天可能就会在我们的生命里发生———



💧**Clue 2**: There's a bit of Gatsby in everyone.



**Evidence 1**: It eluded us then, but that’s no matter — to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning — So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.

它从前逃脱了我们的追求，不过那没关系——明天我们跑得更快一点，把胳臂伸得更远一点……总有一天……于是我们奋力向前划，逆流向上的小舟，不停地被浪潮推回到过去。

全书的最后一段话既是对Gatsby一生的简短概括，也向我们揭示了一个事实：当我们在前进的时候，其实我们也在慢慢被推向过去。所以想要更靠近梦想，就要有逆流而上的气魄还有意志力。

### 今日彩蛋

撇开美国梦的隐喻种种，这本小说其实可以看作是一个千转百回求而不得的爱情故事。Gatsby和Daisy虽然曾经是并肩咫尺的恋人，但两个人之间有着无法逾越的鸿沟。这个距离就像盖茨比总是站在西岸想要伸手去触摸对岸的绿光，可他只能在幻想里完成这个动作，现实里永远都是一步之遥。

但Gatsby的“伟大”之处在于，他不怕做梦，也不怕失败。但现实中的我们，其实并没有那种胆魄和意志，比如有一首叫作“The furtherest distance in the world”（《世界上最遥远的距离》）的诗，就讲了一个在恋爱中屡屡却步的故事。

虽然这首诗的作者争议很大（大部分人误认为是泰戈尔），但不可否认，它的语言之优美以及情感之细腻，放在任何一位抒情诗集中都不会逊色。也有人评论道，这首诗将暗恋中男女的绝望层层抽剥，直至最不可触摸的隐秘末梢。那种只要一伸手就能拿到的幸福，就因为没伸手而永世错过。

最后奉上这首诗的中英版本，希望你可以成为那个勇敢坚定并且逆流而上的人~



**💧The furtherest distance in the world**



The furthest distance in the world

Is not between life and death

But when I stand in front of you

Yet you don’t know that I love you



世界上最远的距离

不是 生与死

而是 我就站在你的面前

你却不知道我爱你



The furthest distance in the world

Is not when I stand in front of you

Yet you can’t see my love

But when undoubtedly knowing the love from both

Yet cannot be together



世界上最远的距离

不是 我就站在你的面前

你却不知道我爱你

而是 明知道彼此相爱

却不能在一起





The furthest distance in the world

Is not being apart while being in love

But when plainly cannot resist the yearning

Yet pretending you have never been in my heart



世界上最远的距离

不是 明知道彼此相爱 却不能在一起

而是 明明无法抵抗这股思念

却还得故意装作丝毫不把你放在心里



The furthest distance in the world

Is not but using one’s indifferent heart

To dig an uncrossible river

For the one who loves you





世界上最远的距离

不是 明明无法抵抗这股思念

却还得故意装作丝毫不把你放在心里

而是 用自己冷漠的心 对爱你的人

掘了一条无法跨越的深渠
