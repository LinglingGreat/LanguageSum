**It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday night — and, as obscurely as it had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over.**

**Only gradually did I become aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away.**

> <font color=red>Only gradually / did I become aware / that the automobiles / which turned expectantly into his drive / stayed for just a minute / and then drove sulkily away.</font>

> ①turned expectantly into his drive “那些乘兴而来的一辆辆汽车”；expectantly指“满心期待地”（with an excited feeling that something is about to happen）; into his drive “开到Gatsby的私人车道上”，drive指“〔房屋与街道之间的〕私人车道”；
>
> ②sulkily “生闷气地，扫兴地”，比如：'You haven't got the right attitude,' he said sulkily.
>
> 他怄气道：“你态度不端正。”
>
> *这些人满怀欣喜地像以往一样准备来参加派对，在发现没有派对后又悻悻地走了。

**Wondering if he were sick I went over to find out — an unfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door.**

> ==villainous英 ['vɪlənəs] 美 [ˈvɪlənəs] adj. 罪恶的；恶棍的；恶毒的；坏透的==
>
> ==squint英 [skwɪnt] 美 [skwɪnt] vi. 眯眼看；斜视；窥视；偏移==

**“Is Mr. Gatsby sick?”**

**“Nope.” After a pause he added “sir”in a dilatory, grudging way.**

> ==dilatory adj. 拖拉的；缓慢的，不慌不忙的==
>
> ==grudging英 ['grʌdʒɪŋ] 美 [ˈɡrʌdʒɪŋ] adj. 勉强的；吝啬的==

**“I hadn’t seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell him Mr. Carraway came over.”**

**“Who?” he demanded rudely.**

**“Carraway.” “Carraway. All right, I’ll tell him.” Abruptly he slammed the door.**

**My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never went into West Egg Village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered moderate supplies over the telephone.**

**The grocery boy reported that the kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the village was that the new people weren’t servants at all.**

**Next day Gatsby called me on the phone.**

**“Going away?” I inquired.**

**“No, old sport.”**

**“I hear you fired all your servants.”**

**“I wanted somebody who wouldn’t gossip. Daisy comes over quite often — in the afternoons.”**

**So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval in her eyes.**

> <font color=red>So the whole caravansary / had fallen in / like a card house / at the disapproval in her eyes.</font>
>
> 如此说来，因为她不喜欢，这座大酒店就像纸牌搭的房子一样整个坍掉了。

> ①the whole caravansary “这座大酒店”，caravansary可以指过去的那种商队客栈，也可以指路边的酒店（相当于hotel）;
>
> *这里把Gatsby的房子比喻成前来寻欢作乐的人们的栖息之所。
>
> ②fall in 表示“倒塌”（to collapse）;
>
> *Daisy并不喜欢Gatsby所举办的这些浮华的派对，因为无论是派对的氛围还是前来参加的人，都触犯了Daisy身上的那种尊贵气息。这里也有讽刺的意味：仅仅因为Daisy的反对，一座如此豪华壮丽的房子就仿佛像纸牌屋一样坍塌了。

**“They’re some people Wolfsheim wanted to do something for. They’re all brothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel.”**

**“I see.” He was calling up at Daisy’s request — would I come to lunch at her house to-morrow? Miss Baker would be there.**

**Half an hour later Daisy herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was coming.**

**Something was up.**

**And yet I couldn’t believe that they would choose this occasion for a scene — especially for the rather harrowing scene that Gatsby had outlined in the garden.**

> <font color=red>And yet / I couldn’t believe / that they would choose this occasion for a scene / — especially for the rather harrowing scene / that Gatsby had outlined in the garden.</font>
>
> 然而我却不能相信他们竞然会选这样一个场合来大闹一场——尤其是盖茨比早先在花园里所提出的那种令人难堪的场面。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①choose this occasion for a scene “选这样一个场合来大闹一场”；scene在这里指“发脾气； 当众吵闹”，make a scene就是指embarrass people by publicly showing one's anger about something or doing something that is against the morals.
>
> ②the rather harrowing scene “那种令人难堪的场面”；harrowing指“折磨人的”（extremely upsetting or disturbing）.
>
> *Gatsby描绘的这个令人难堪的场面是指：He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and say: “I never loved you.” (Chapter 6.3)

**The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of the summer.**

**As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush at noon.**

> ==simmer英 ['sɪmə] 美 [ˈsɪmɚ] vi. 炖；内心充满；即将爆发==

> 原文：As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush at noon.
>
> 当我乘的火车从地道里钻出来驶进阳光里时，只有全国饼干公司热辣辣的汽笛打破了中午闷热的静寂。
>
> 💧simmering在这里指“酝酿已久的”。simmer原义是“炖，煨”，可以引申为“充满（难以控制的感情，尤指愤怒） ”，比如：She was stillsimmering with resentment.
>
> 她依旧憋着一肚子的怨恨。

**The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion; the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her fingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry.**

> 客车里的草椅垫热得简直要着火了。坐在我旁边的一个妇女起先很斯文地让汗水渗透衬衣，后来，她的报纸在她手指下面也变潮了时，她长叹一声，在酷热中颓然地往后一倒。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①hovered on the edge of combustion “热得简直要着火了”；hover表示“处于不稳定的状态”，hover on the edge of也就是“接近，快要”；比如：She hovered on the brink (=edge) of death for three months as doctors battled to save her. 
>
> 3个月来在医生们奋力挽救她的生命的过程中，她一直处在死亡的边缘。
>
> ②perspired delicately...into her white shirtwaist“很斯文地让汗水渗透衬衣”；perspire是比sweat更正式的表示“出汗”的说法；perspire delicately并不是真的“斯文地出汗”，而是诙谐地表示“微微出汗”（和后文“连报纸也变潮了”形成对比）；
>
> ③lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry “她长叹一声，在酷热中颓然地往后一倒”；lapse into表示“陷入”，比如：Alison lapsed into puzzled silence. 艾利森一头雾水，不作声了。desolate原义指“荒凉的”（deserted），还可以描述人“孤独凄凉的，忧伤的”（joyless, sorrowful）.

**Her pocket-book slapped to the floor.**

**“Oh, my!” she gasped.**

**I picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it at arm’s length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that I had no designs upon it — but everyone near by, including the woman, suspected me just the same.**

**“Hot!” said the conductor to familiar faces.**

**“Some weather! hot! hot! hot! Is it hot enough for you? Is it hot? Is it.. .?”**

**My commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand.**

> ==stain英 [steɪn] 美 [sten] vt. 玷污；败坏；给…着色==

**That any one should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed, whose head made damp the pajama pocket over his heart! . . .**

**Through the hall of the Buchanans’ house blew a faint wind, carrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at the door.**

**“The master’s body!” roared the butler into the mouthpiece.**

**“I’m sorry, madame, but we can’t furnish it — it’s far too hot to touch this noon!”**

**What he really said was: “Yes . . . yes . . . I’ll see.”**

**He set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to take our stiff straw hats.**

**“Madame expects you in the salon!” he cried, needlessly indicating the direction.**

**In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the common store of life.**

> <font color=red>In this heat / every extra gesture / was an affront to / the common store of life.</font>

**The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool.**

**Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols weighing down their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.**

**“We can’t move,” they said together.**

**Jordan’s fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment in mine.**

**“And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?” I inquired.**

**Simultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall telephone.**

**Gatsby stood in the centre of the crimson carpet and gazed around with fascinated eyes.**

> ==crimson英 ['krɪmz(ə)n] 美 [ˈkrɪmzən] n. 深红色==

**Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting laugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.**

**“The rumor is,” whispered Jordan, “that that’s Tom’s girl on the telephone.” We were silent.**

**The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance: “Very well, then, I won’t sell you the car at all. . . . I’m underno obligations to you at all . . . and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time, I won’t stand that at all!”**

**“Holding down the receiver,” said Daisy cynically.**

**“No, he’s not,” I assured her.**

**“It’s a bona-fide deal. I happen to know about it.”**

**Tom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his thick body, and hurried into the room.**

**“Mr. Gatsby!” He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed dislike.**

**“I’m glad to see you, sir. . . . Nick . . . .”**

**“Make us a cold drink,” cried Daisy.**

**As he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and pulled his face down, kissing him on the mouth.**

**“You know I love you,” she murmured.**

**“You forget there’s a lady present,” said Jordan.**

**Daisy looked around doubtfully.**

**“You kiss Nick too.”**

**“What a low, vulgar girl!”**

**“I don’t care!” cried Daisy, and began to clog on the brick fireplace.**

**Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.**

**“Bles-sed pre-cious,” she crooned, holding out her arms.**

**“Come to your own mother that loves you.”**

**The child, relinquished by the nurse,rushed across the room and rooted shyly into her mother’s dress.**

> <font color=red>relinquish英 [rɪ'lɪŋkwɪʃ] 美 [rɪˈlɪŋkwɪʃ] vt. 放弃；放手；让渡</font>

> 💧relinquish表示“放弃（尤指不情愿）”，也可以指“让出（权利，财产等）”，比如：He was forced to relinquish control of the company.
>
> 他被迫放弃对公司的控制权。

**“The bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy hair? Stand up now, and say — How-de-do.”**

**Gatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small, reluctant hand.**

**Afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise.**

**I don’t think he had ever really believed in its existence before.**

**“I got dressed before luncheon,” said the child, turning eagerly to Daisy.**

**“That’s because your mother wanted to show you off.”**

**Her face bent into the single wrinkle of the small, white neck.**

**“You dream, you. You absolute little dream.”**

**“Yes,” admitted the child calmly.**

**“Aunt Jordan’s got on a white dress too.”**

**“How do you like mother’s friends?”**

**Daisy turned her around so that she faced Gatsby.**

**“Do you think they’re pretty?”**

**“Where’s Daddy?”**

**“She doesn’t look like her father,” explained Daisy.**

**“She looks like me. She’s got my hair and shape of the face.”**

**Daisy sat back upon the couch.**

**The nurse took a step forward and held out her hand.**

**“Come, Pammy.”**

**“Good-by, sweetheart!”**

**With a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to her nurse’s hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back, preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.**

**Gatsby took up his drink.**

**“They certainly look cool,” he said, with visible tension.**

**We drank in long, greedy swallows.**

**“I read somewhere that the sun’s getting hotter every year,” said Tom genially.**

**“It seems that pretty soon the earth’s going to fall into the sun — or wait a minute — it’s just the opposite — the sun’s getting colder every year.**

**“Come outside,” he suggested to Gatsby, “I’d like you to have a look at the place.”**

### 背景知识

**💧Trimalchio 特里马尔乔**

...as obscurely as it had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over.（他作为特里马尔乔的生涯，当初莫名其妙地开始，现在又莫名其妙地结束了。）

Trimalchio（特里马尔乔）是罗马作家皮特罗尼斯作品《讽刺篇》中一个大宴宾客的暴户发（ a character in the 1st century AD Roman work of fiction Satyricon by Petronius）.  他原本是一个奴隶，被解放后通过自己的坚毅和努力得到权力和财富（freedman who through hard work and perseverance has attained power and wealth）. 他为人所知也是因为常常举办豪华的盛会宴请宾客（known for throwing lavish dinner parties）.

Trimalchio in West Egg也是Fitzegerald为这本书写的备选书名之一哦~



**💧Awning 天蓬**



The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. (这间屋子外面有这篷挡着，又阴暗又凉快。)

awning是指安置房子外墙上的用于遮阳或挡雨的天篷（a secondary covering attached to the exterior wall of a building）. 如下图↓

### 课文理解

在上次的聚会之后，人们（包括Nick）对Gatsby的好奇也渐渐越来越重了。但让大家意外的是，Gatsby的豪宅再也没有在周六的时候灯火通明过——也就是说，派对停止了。在Nick登门拜访Gatsby的时候，他才发现Gatsby还辞退了所有的仆人。而这一切举动，都是为了小心翼翼地保护他和Daisy的关系（"Daisy comes over quite often — in the afternoons."）——



💧**Clue 1**: Gatsby is discreet in protecting his affair with Daisy.



**Evidence 1**: My Finn informed me that Gatsbyad dismissed every servant in his house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never went into West Egg Village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered moderate supplies over the telephone.

我的芬兰女佣人告诉我，盖茨比早在一个星期前就辞退了家里的每一个仆人，另外雇用了五六个人，这些人从来不到西卵镇上去采购然后顺便收取店主的贿赂，而是打电话订购数量不多的生活用品。

“收取店主的贿赂”是指有些人可能想通过收买Gatsby的仆人来打听他的私人生活。足见Gatsby有多么小心谨慎了。



**Evidence 2**: They’re some people Wolfsheim wanted to do something for. They’re all brothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel.”

"他们是沃尔夫山姆要给帮点儿忙的人。他们都是兄弟姐妹。他们开过一家小旅馆。"



Nick观察到这些人似乎并不是真的仆人，比如给他开门的“仆人”是一副凶神恶煞的样子（"an unfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door"）. 根据Gatsby的透露，这些人是Wolfsheim找来的，目的是为了给他们安排一份工作。用这些人来当仆人的好处就是，他们从外地来，和West Egg的本地人自然没有接触，也就不用担心会走漏风声。

之后Nick和Gatsby一起受邀到Daisy家里做客。炎热的天气让故事氛围紧张躁动起来，与此同时，一场灾祸也正在酝酿。在这个过程中，作者也开始密集地安插预示最后悲剧的线索了。比如今天的内容中就有一个小细节揭示Gatsby的想象和现实之间的冲突——



💧**Clue 2**: Gatsby's perception is in collision with reality.



**Evidence 1**: Afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise. I don’t think he had ever really believed in its existence before.

然后他惊奇地盯着孩子看。我想他以前从来没有真正相信过有这个孩子存在。

Gatsby一直在自己的世界里重塑Daisy的形象，乃至于忘记了现实中的Daisy已经结婚并且已经有了一个可爱的女儿（从前面Daisy和女儿的互动来看她非常喜欢这个孩子）。这里Gatsby并没有作出过于激烈的反应，也许是他在努力按捺，也可能是他继续选择忽视。但随着现实逐渐迫近，他必然要面对最残酷的情况，到时候又会发生什么呢？

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****各种场合下的scene**

今天的原文里出现了用scene表示“当众吵闹”这个用法（And yet I couldn’t believe that they would choose this occasion for a scene）, 我们再来看一看scene在其他场合下还能表达什么意思~



\1. Behind the scenes 幕后

这个很好理解，scenes在这里就是指“（电视/电影）屏幕”，behind the scenes也就是指“幕后”啦~ 一般在致辞感谢的时候都会提到幕后工作人员，比如：

Let's have a round of applause for all the people who worked behind the scenes to give us such a great event!

behind the scenes也可指“实景拍摄场地，摄影棚”。



\2. Not one's scene 不感兴趣/不擅长

这里的scene指“圈子，领域”，比如on the music scene就是“在音乐领域”。所以not one's scene就是“不是某人的领域（不感兴趣或不擅长）”。比如：

-"Do you want to come with me to the concert this Saturday?"

-"No thanks, heavy metal isn't my scene."

 

\3. Arrive on the scene 到达现场/诞生

scene可以指“某个事件发生的现场”，而且一般是不好的事件，arrive on the scene就表示“到达现场”，比如：

By the time I arrived on the scene, Kate and Jen were already arguing.



此外，arrive on the scene还可以表示“诞生，问世”，比如：

①We are overjoyed to announced that our baby daughter arrived on the scene at 11:37 last night.

②Funk music arrived on the scene in the 1960s.

 

\4. Heavy scene 沉重的场面

heavy scene指“情况严重或困难的场面”，比如：

Man, that meeting was really a heavy scene.

电影里面的一些可怕场景也可以说成是heavy scene.



\5. Have a change of scene 换（生活/工作）环境

当你想要搬到另一个城市来换一个生活环境的时候，就可以这么说：

I decided to move across the country for college because I really wanted a change of scene after growing up in this small town.

**I went with them out to the veranda.**

**On the green Sound, stagnant in the heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea.**

> 在绿色的海湾上，海水在酷热中停滞不动，一条小帆船慢慢向比较新鲜的海水移动。

>
> 他正在就如何振兴低迷的经济征求意见。

**Gatsby’s eyes followed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed across the bay.**

**“I’m right across from you.” “So you are.”**

**Our eyes lifted over the rose-beds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse of the dog-days along-shore.**

**Slowly the white wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit of the sky.**

**Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and the abounding blessed isles.**

> ==isle英 [aɪl] 美 [aɪl] n. 岛==

> 再往前是水波荡漾的海洋和星罗棋布的宝岛。

**“There’s sport for you,” said Tom, nodding.**

**“I’d like to be out there with him for about an hour.”**

**We had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened too against the heat, and drank down nervous gayety with the cold ale.**

>
> 我们在餐厅里吃的午饭，里面也遮得很阴凉，大家把紧张的欢笑和凉啤酒一起喝下肚去。

> ①darkened too against the heat “遮得很阴凉”；这里指餐厅的窗户外也安置了遮阳的天篷（我们昨天介绍的awning）;
>
> ②drank down nervous gayety with the cold ale“大家把紧张的欢笑和凉啤酒一起喝下肚去”；drink down指“一饮而尽”（to drink all of something）; nervous gayety也是一组矛盾修辞（Oxymoron）, 这里暗示虽然表面上气氛融洽，但其实大家都各自心怀鬼胎。

**“What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon?” cried Daisy, “and the day after that, and the next thirty years?”**

**“Don’t be morbid,” Jordan said.**

**“Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.”**

> ==morbid==

> adj.（兴趣、精神、思想等）病态的
>
> 原文：“Don’t be morbid,” Jordan said. “Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.”
>
> "不要这样胡思乱想，"乔丹说，"秋天一到，天高气爽，生活就又重新开始了。

> 💧morbid表示“病态的”，尤指“心理上不正常的”，比如：Some people have a morbid fascination with crime.
>
> 一些人对犯罪有一种病态的痴迷。
>
> 💧morbid的名词形式是morbidity. morbidity and mortality就是指“（某一疾病的）发病率和死亡率” 。

**“But it’s so hot,” insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, “and everything’s so confused. Let’s all go to town!”**

**Her voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, molding its senselessness into forms.**

> <font color=red>Her voice struggled on / through the heat, / beating against it, / molding its senselessness into forms.</font>
>
> 她的声音继续在热浪中挣扎，向它冲击着，把没有知觉的热气塑成各种形状。
>
> **💧表达精讲**
>
> ①struggled on through the heat “继续在热浪中挣扎”；struggle on 表示“继续挣扎”（keep on struggling）, on在这里作副词，表示一种持续性；
>
> ②molding its senselessness into forms “把没有知觉的热气塑成各种形状”；senselessness是指热气（the heat）本身的特质，有两层含义：“没有知觉、意识”（unconsciousness）; “没有意义、目的”（meaningness）;
>
> *这里作者表达得很晦涩，但其实就是在暗指Daisy说的话、她的声音也充斥着“无意义”，比如：“What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon?” cried Daisy, “and the day after that, and the next thirty years?”

**“I’ve heard of making a garage out of a stable,” Tom was saying to Gatsby, “but I’m the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage.”**

**“Who wants to go to town?” demanded Daisy insistently.**

**Gatsby’s eyes floated toward her.**

**“Ah,” she cried, “you look so cool.”**

**Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space.**

**With an effort she glanced down at the table.**

**“You always look so cool,” she repeated.**

**She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw.**

**He was astounded.**

**His mouth opened a little, and he looked at Gatsby, and then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as some one he knew a long time ago.**

**“You resemble the advertisement of the man,” she went on innocently.**

**“You know the advertisement of the man ——”**

**“All right,” broke in Tom quickly, “I’m perfectly willing to go to town. Come on — we’re all going to town.”**

**He got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife. No one moved.**

**“Come on!” His temper cracked a little.**

**“What’s the matter, anyhow? If we’re going to town, let’s start.”**

**His hand, trembling with his effort at self-control, bore to his lips the last of his glass of ale.**

**Daisy’s voice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing gravel drive.**

**“Are we just going to go?” she objected.**

**“Like this? Aren’t we going to let any one smoke a cigarette first?”**

**“Everybody smoked all through lunch.”**

**“Oh, let’s have fun,” she begged him.**

**“It’s too hot to fuss.”**

**He didn’t answer.**

**“Have it your own way,” she said.**

**“Come on, Jordan.”**

**They went up-stairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet.**

> ==shuffle英 ['ʃʌf(ə)l] 美 [ˈʃʌfəl] v. 洗牌；推诿，推卸；拖曳，慢吞吞地走；搅乱==

**A silver curve of the moon hovered already in the western sky.**

**Gatsby started to speak, changed his mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.**

**“Have you got your stables here?” asked Gatsby with an effort.**

**“About a quarter of a mile down the road.” “Oh.” A pause.**

**“I don’t see the idea of going to town,” broke out Tom savagely.**

> ==savagely英 ['sævɪdʒlɪ] 美 [ˈsævɪdʒlɪ] adv. 野蛮地；残忍地==

**“Women get these notions in their heads ——”**

**“Shall we take anything to drink?” called Daisy from an upper window.**

**“I’ll get some whiskey,” answered Tom. He went inside.**

**Gatsby turned to me rigidly: “I can’t say anything in his house, old sport.”**

**“She’s got an indiscreet voice,” I remarked. “It’s full of ——” I hesitated.**

**“Her voice is full of money,” he said suddenly.**

**That was it. I’d never understood before.**

**It was full of money — that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals’song of it. . . . high in a white palace the king’s daughter, the golden girl. . . .**

**Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and carrying light capes over their arms.**

**“Shall we all go in my car?” suggested Gatsby.**

**He felt the hot, green leather of the seat.**

**“I ought to have left it in the shade.”**

**“Is it standard shift?” demanded Tom.**

**“Yes.” “Well, you take my coupe and let me drive your car to town.”**

**The suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby.**

**“I don’t think there’s much gas,” he objected.**

**“Plenty of gas,” said Tom boisterously.**

**He looked at the gauge. “And if it runs out I can stop at a drug-store. You can buy anything at a drug-store nowadays.”**

**A pause followed this apparently pointless remark.**

**Daisy looked at Tom frowning, and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar and vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in words, passed over Gatsby’s face.**

**“Come on, Daisy,” said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby’s car.**

**“I’ll take you in this circus wagon.”**

**He opened the door, but she moved out from the circle of his arm.**

**“You take Nick and Jordan. We’ll follow you in the coupe.”**

**She walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand.**

**Jordan and Tom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby’s car, Tom pushed the unfamiliar gears tentatively, and we shot off into the oppressive heat, leaving them out of sight behind.**

**“Did you see that?” demanded Tom.**

**“See what?” He looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and I must have known all along.**

**“You think I’m pretty dumb, don’t you?” he suggested.**

**“Perhaps I am, but I have a — almost a second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to do. Maybe you don’t believe that, but science ——” He paused.**

**“I’ve made a small investigation of this fellow,” he continued.**

**“I could have gone deeper if I’d known ——”**

**“Do you mean you’ve been to a medium?” inquired Jordan humorously.**

**“What?” Confused, he stared at us as we laughed. “A medium?”**

**“About Gatsby.”**

**“About Gatsby! No, I haven’t. I said I’d been making a small investigation of his past.”**

**“And you found he was an Oxford man,” said Jordan helpfully.**

**“An Oxford man!” He was incredulous.**

**“Like hell he is! He wears a pink suit.”**

**“Nevertheless he’s an Oxford man.”**

**“Oxford, New Mexico,” snorted Tom contemptuously, “or something like that.”**

**“Listen, Tom. If you’re such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?” demanded Jordan crossly.**

**“Daisy invited him; she knew him before we were married — God knows where!”**

**We were all irritable now with the fading ale, and aware of it we drove for a while in silence.**

**Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg’s faded eyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby’s caution about gasoline.**

**“We’ve got enough to get us to town,” said Tom.**

**“But there’s a garage right here,” objected Jordan.**

**“I don’t want to get stalled in this baking heat.”**

**Tom threw on both brakes impatiently, and we slid to an abruptdusty stop under Wilson’s sign.**

**After a moment the proprietor emerged from the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car.**

**“Let’s have some gas!” cried Tom roughly.**

**“What do you think we stopped for — to admire the view?”**

**“I’m sick,” said Wilson without moving.**

**“Been sick all day.”**

**“What’s the matter?” “I’m all run down.”**

**“Well, shall I help myself?” Tom demanded.**

**“You sounded well enough on the phone.”**

**With an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and, breathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank.**

**In the sunlight his face was green.**

**“I didn’t mean to interrupt your lunch,” he said.**

**“But I need money pretty bad, and I was wondering what you were going to do with your old car.”**

**“How do you like this one?” inquired Tom. “I bought it last week.”**

**“It’s a nice yellow one,” said Wilson,as he strained at the handle.**

**“Like to buy it?”**

**“Big chance,” Wilson smiled faintly.**

**“No, but I could make some money on the other.”**

**“What do you want money for, all of a sudden?”**

**“I’ve been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and I want to go West.”**

**“Your wife does,” exclaimed Tom, startled.**

**“She’s been talking about it for ten years.”**

**He rested for a moment against the pump, shading his eyes.**

**“And now she’s going whether she wants to or not. I’m going to get her away.”**

### 背景知识

**💧Connotation of the color pink** 

**粉色暗示了什么？**

“An Oxford man!” He was incredulous. “Like hell he is! He wears a pink suit.”（"牛津大学毕业生！"他完全不相信，"他要是才他妈的怪哩！他穿一套粉红色衣服。"）

为什么Tom仅仅因为Gatsby穿了一套粉红色的衣服就笃定说他不是牛津大学毕业的呢？虽然今天我们对于粉色的偏见往往在于它的性别气质，比如认为粉色代表的是女性气质femininity, 对于穿粉色衣服的男孩会“戏称”为sissy（女孩子气的男孩）。但在20世纪初的美国，粉色常常和一个人的出身阶级（class origin）联系在一起：

 

Pink had working-class connotations.

也就是说，工人阶层才会穿粉色，一个受过高等教育、上层社会的绅士是不会穿粉色的（An educated, upper-class gentleman – an Oxford man – would not wear a pink suit）.

 

但在今天，这个潮流也出现了反转。比如喜欢穿粉色T恤或者在高尔夫球场上穿粉色裤子的，常常是混迹各个乡间俱乐部（country club）的年轻富家子弟们（It’s the preppie type men at the country club who are wearing pink shirts or even, on the golf course, pants）.



**💧Snob 势利鬼**



“Listen, Tom. If you’re such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?” demanded Jordan crossly.

"我说，汤姆，你既然这样”瞧不起人，那么为什么请他吃午饭呢？"乔丹气恼地质问道。

snob指“自命不凡的人，势利鬼”（a person who despises, ignores, or is patronizing to those he or she considers inferior）. 我们熟悉的虚构人物形象属于snob这一类呢？

 

比如，《怪物史莱克》里的白马王子（Prince Charming）:

"I am the rightful King of Far Far Away!"（我才是遥远王国的真正国王！）

"I mean, how charming can I be when I have to pretend that I'm that dreadful orge?"（要我装成那个可怕的怪物，我还怎么展示我的魅力呢！）——Prince Charming把自己变成Shrek接近Fiona, 但说话和行为都完全是自己原本暴躁傲慢的样子，结果当然没能赢得Fiona的爱和信任，于是有了以上的托辞。

### 课文理解

开头的场景依然是在Tom的豪宅里。尽管表面上其乐融融，但暗地里却隐藏着不少紧张激烈的情节，比如Daisy在Tom的面前公然和Gatsby调情——



💧**Clue 1**: Dasiy is being obvious about her affair with 



**Evidence 1**: “You always look so cool,” she repeated. She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw.

"你看上去总是那么帅。"她重复说。她已经告诉他她爱他，汤姆·布坎农也看出来了。

 

比起Gatsby的小心谨慎，Daisy则轻佻得多。比如毫不掩饰自己从以前就认识Gatsby这件事（Daisy用了always）, 以及她对他的爱慕 。

之后大家一起准备出发去纽约市里的时候，Daisy拒绝和Tom同车，而是大摇大摆地走向了Gatsby, 还用手拽着他的上衣（俨然一副小鸟依人的模样）——



**Evidence 2**: He opened the door, but she moved out from the circle of his arm. “You take Nick and Jordan. We’ll follow you in the coupe.” She walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand.

他打开车门，但她从他手臂的圈子里走了出去。"你带尼克和乔丹去。我们开小轿车跟在你后面。" 她走近盖茨比，用手摸着他的上衣。

这可以说是Daisy对Tom出轨在先的挑衅和反击了，但她是否真的有意要和Gatsby再续前缘也还没能下定论。我们再来看一看今天内容里出现的Daisy声音的描述——



💧**Clue 2**: Daisy's voice is materialistic and shallow.



**Evidence 1**: It was full of money — that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals’ song of it. . . . high in a white palace the king’s daughter, the golden girl. . . .

它是充满了金钱——这正是她声音里抑扬起伏的无穷无尽的魅力的源泉，金钱了当的声音，铙钹齐鸣的歌声……高高的在一座白色的宫殿里，国王的女儿，黄金女郎……

 

在前面的几章内容中，Daisy的声音给我们留下的印象是“迷人的”（enchanting）“神秘的”（mysterious）, 总是让人不由自主地朝她靠近。而这里的描述则更直接——“她的声音充满了金钱”，有两层含义：一是指她出身富有；二是指她对物质金钱有着强烈的渴望。

除了物质性，她的声音还透露了她的肤浅——



**Evidence 2**: “What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon?” cried Daisy, “and the day after that, and the next thirty years?”

"我们今天下午做什么好呢？"黛西大声说，"还有明天，还有今后三十年？"

 

读到这里，大家也许想起了Nick第一次到他们家做客的时候，Daisy也有过一番类似的发问：“Do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it.” “All right,” said Daisy. “What’ll we plan?” She turned to me helplessly: “What do people plan?”

这两处的问句都属于“假装疑问”（Aporia）的修辞手法，也就是说话者虽然在提问，但其实并不期待可以得到回答，因为问题本身往往是无解的，比如《哈姆雷特》中的"To be, or not to be: that is the question."就是一个典型的例子。

这些问题反映出了Daisy内心的空洞，另一方面也折射了她所处的上流阶层的生活，在浮华背后其实是空虚和挥霍。

### 今日彩蛋

**💧****Some knowledge about beer 啤酒常识**

因为天气炎热，所以故事里的主人公们都喝起了冰啤酒来解暑（We had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened too against the heat, and drank down nervous gayety with the cold ale）.

那么这里的ale指的是什么啤酒呢？我们来看一看啤酒的分类~

 

\1. 啤酒分类

啤酒进化的过程有几千年的时间，弄不清它的风格口味是很正常的。一般可以按照颜色和产地来分，但也可以根据啤酒本身的发酵方式（国外习惯直接在啤酒瓶上标注啤酒的风味，所以了解发酵方式会更在选择种类的时候更便利哦~），最基本的是两种：Ale（爱尔）和Lager（拉格）。两者的差别只在于发酵的温度和酵母工作的位置（Ale是上发酵，Lager是下发酵）↓

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/34fdf803968f30ef087214293ee8e67f-sz_15257.jpg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



直观来说，就是喝Ale啤酒的时候先喝到酵母和辅料的味道，之后要在这些味道里面找麦芽的香味，而Lager啤酒先喝到的是麦芽的香味，然后才有其它辅料的味道。 

 

其他各种风味都是从两种发酵方式演变而来的，比如黑啤（Stout）就属于Ale的一种。黑啤的出现是因为1698年彼得大帝在它的欧洲之旅时爱上了 英国波特黑啤酒，并要求英国酒商为俄罗斯圣彼得堡的宫廷酿造波特啤酒。但是，由于途经两百多公里寒冷的波罗的海，啤酒面临冻结、变坏等问题，变得不可饮用。英国酒商随之进行改良，增强了该酒的酒精浓度和啤酒花投放量（所以酒精度数比较高并且苦味很重），以抵御严寒的天气并更好保存啤酒。

 

最有名的一款黑啤是由英国约克郡森美尔（Samuel Smith）啤酒厂生产的帝国世涛（Imperial Stout）.

在《王牌特工》里出现的健力士（Guinness）也是黑啤。

而国内产的青岛、燕京都属于Lager（所以品牌商会非常强调“麦芽”，因为Lager先喝到的是麦芽香）。

 

\2. 啤酒选择

一般在选择啤酒的时候很容易产生以下误解：

①啤酒的颜色越深酒精度越高？

深色的啤酒往往给人带来酒精度更高、口味更重的感觉。在绝大数情况下啤酒的颜色取决于麦芽，而决定酒精度高低的是麦汁中的含糖量，而不是麦芽的颜色。同时也跟酿制工艺有关。

![img](http://img.xiumi.us/xmi/ua/anoo/i/0c9fe01e0fcab1c3aee0fc1874661c77-sz_21110.jpeg?x-oss-process=style/xmorient)



②啤酒泡沫越多越好？

啤酒质量好坏不能以泡沫的多少来定。优质啤酒的泡沫应细腻、洁白，且挂杯持久，酒液饮完之后仍有大量泡沫在杯壁之上，才是真正的好啤酒。同时泡沫的多少还取决于啤酒的风格和当时的饮用温度。

 

③啤酒还有生的？熟的？

熟啤（Pasteurimd）指的是经过了巴氏消毒灭菌的啤酒。但高温杀菌使其牺牲了一定的口感，并不是最好喝的啤酒。真正好喝的是生啤，也叫鲜啤（Draught）, 它保留了啤酒原有的风味和活性酵母菌，口感更胜一筹。但这种啤酒保质期不长只有3—5天，而且必须低温保存。

并且在生啤里最好喝的是——“扎啤”（Draft）. draft是指“经过净化、汲取的”，这样命名是因为扎啤从酿造工艺来讲，本质就是酿制成熟的，未经热处理的。因此也保持了良好的口味和营养。

对于喜欢清淡口味的小伙伴来说，light beer也会是不错的选择哦~
