From Prof. Majumdar:
Take your seminar very seriously, as if it is a job interview talk.
Believe me, your future job and career will depend on this!!  Here are some pointers:

•       Prepare a 30 min talk, which means at most 20 slides.
•       Provide a scientific context of your work, not just that you did something.  Always try to answer the hows and whys, and what is the big picture and what scientific or technological question you are answering?
•       Present your talk as if you are putting together an intriguing story. That is, anticipate questions that your audience may be thinking of and then answer them.
•       The goal of the talk is not to show how much you know, but to make sure your audience understands your message.  Put yourself in the audiences’ shoes and see whether you are putting them to sleep or simply annoying them. Don’t talk too fast, slow down.

2/3:

•       The talk should have one clear message and all the slides should revolve around that single message or scientific question/puzzle.
•       Use pictures, animations, and graphics to make sure your audience understands your message.
•       Use equations only to drive the message or to emphasize the scientific context.
•       Use color to emphasize the message.
•       Put your work in perspective of past work (acknowledge others by names or papers) and clearly show what is new in your work.
•       Do not claim more than you should or can.  But claim what you rightfully deserve, i.e. what is new in your work with respect to others.
•       Make sure your viewgraphs are not crowded and all the writing is legible. Sometimes less is more, since it highlights your message.

3/3:

Finally, remember your body language and enthusiasm is contagious and counts for more than you may think. Make eye contact with your audience and smile once in a while.  Vary your pitch and volume to
keep your audience interested.  Crack a joke if you need to, just to give your audience a break from some heavy science.  Given all things equal, these intangibles could decide your future.
